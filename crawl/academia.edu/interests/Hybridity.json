Drawing on the work of cultural techniques (e.g. Siegert 2015; Vismann 2013) and Levi-Strauss' The Raw and the Cooked (1970), I argued that the relationship between humans and food is primary to how the human understands itself and forms part of the ground of human ontological systems. I'd like to take this argument further today, to a system-level perspective of food production and beyond, to a posthuman future where food no longer resembles what we know it as today, and because of this, where the human as such arguably ceases to exist, as the ground upon which it has defined self and species is transcended. I'm responding both to fictional future food visions and aspirations towards technical solutions to our current food-related crises.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52671613, "asset_id": 32484966, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2681768, "first_name": "Siobhan", "last_name": "Watters", "domain_name": "sfu", "page_name": "SiobhanWatters", "display_name": "Siobhan Watters", "profile_url": "https://sfu.academia.edu/SiobhanWatters?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2681768/856992/6720740/s65_siobhan.watters.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 196, "name": "Future Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Future_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 928, "name": "Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1032, "name": "Cyborg Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyborg_Theory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1698, "name": "Marxism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marxism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3115, "name": "Posthumanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Posthumanism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3539, "name": "Food Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Systems?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5345, "name": "Photosynthesis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Photosynthesis?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 8434, "name": "Bernard Stiegler", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bernard_Stiegler?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 8694, "name": "Science Fiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_Fiction?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 9846, "name": "Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 10048, "name": "Future Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Future_Media?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 10101, "name": "Critical Posthumanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Posthumanism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 12315, "name": "Media Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13958, "name": "Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 20073, "name": "Bruno Latour", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bruno_Latour?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 20430, "name": "Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Claude_L%C3%A9vi-Strauss?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 22251, "name": "Agriculture and Food Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agriculture_and_Food_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 33298, "name": "Karl Marx", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Karl_Marx?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 43678, "name": "Food Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 91714, "name": "Timothy Morton", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Timothy_Morton?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 119882, "name": "Media and Cultural techniques", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Cultural_techniques?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 288892, "name": "German Media Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_Media_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 396004, "name": "Media theory and Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_theory_and_Research?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 432709, "name": "Industrial Agriculture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Industrial_Agriculture?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1725191, "name": "Cultural Techniques", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Techniques?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1774234, "name": "Bernhard Siegert", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bernhard_Siegert?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 7557074, "title": "Framing a De-Territoralized, Hybrid Alternative to Nationalist Essentialism in the Postcolonial Era: Tjalie Robinson and the Diasporic Eurasian 'Indo' Community", "created_at": "2014-07-04T06:57:03.816-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7557074/Framing_a_De_Territoralized_Hybrid_Alternative_to_Nationalist_Essentialism_in_the_Postcolonial_Era_Tjalie_Robinson_and_the_Diasporic_Eurasian_Indo_Community?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_7557074", "summary": "The dislocated, deterritorialized discourse produced by repatriates from formerly European colonies has remained overlooked in academic scholarship. One such group is the Eurasian \u201cIndo\u201d community that has its roots in the former Dutch East Indies, today\u2019s Indonesia. This article focuses on Tjalie Robinson, the intellectual leader of this community from the 1950s to the mid-1970s. The son of a Dutch father and a British-Javanese mother, Robinson became the leading voice of the diasporic Indo community in the Netherlands and later also in the United States. His engagement resulted in the foundation of the Indo magazine Tong Tong and the annual Pasar Malam Besar, what was to become the world\u2019s biggest Eurasian festival. Robinson played an essential role in the cultural awareness and self-pride of the eventually global Indo community through his elaboration of a hybrid and transnational identity concept. By placing his focus \u201ctussen twee werelden\u201d (in-between two worlds) and identifying \u201cmixties-schap\u201d (mestizaje) as the essential characteristic of Indo identity, Robinson anticipated debates on hybridity, transnationalism, and creolism that only much later would draw attention from scholars in the field of postcolonial studies. This article highlights Robinson\u2019s pioneering role in framing a deterritorialized hybrid alternative to nationalist essentialism in the postcolonial era.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

How are individuals socialized in Rome, Bombay, and Tokyo? To answer this question, a unique investigation has been carried out using two scales of analysis usually tackled separately by global studies: the scale of the cosmopolitan world and its global narratives, imaginaries, iconographies; as well as the scale of everyday life and socialization to otherness. This two-fold perspective constitutes the innovative approach of this volume that endeavors to address an operationalization of the cosmopolitan perspective and reacts to current debates and new research findings. \nThis book was first published in 2016 as Pluriel et commun. Sociologie d\u2019un monde cosmopolite by Les Presses de Sciences Po.\nVincenzo Cicchelli is Associate Professor of Sociology at Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes and Research Fellow at GEMASS, Universit\u00e9 Paris Sorbonne/CNRS.

He has published (with Sylvie Octobre) Aesthetico-Cultural Cosmopolitanism and French Youth. The Taste of the World (Palgrave, 2018).\n\n\u201cVincenzo Cicchelli has written a new and much needed book. He explores people\u2019s experiences of a shared and plural world, and the tangible, ordinary mechanisms of global society that are shaping the cultural imaginaries and the lives of individuals today. Plural and Shared is a major contribution to understanding the cultural shifts of our time and how cosmopolitanism may be understood in this context.\u201d\n\u2013 David Held, Professor of Sociology, Durham University\n\n\u201cTimely and important, [\u2026] a well-written and meticulously researched monograph that stands as a major contribution to the growing body of literature on cosmopolitanism. It is a \u2018must read\u2019 for anyone wanting to understand the historic and modern forces shaping our increasingly globalizing and cosmopolitan world.\u201d\n\u2013 Elijah Anderson, Professor of Sociology, Yale University\n\n\u201cCicchelli has written a thought-provoking book about an important and timely topic: how can we come to terms with the cosmopolitan world, which we share but which is inherently plural, composed of different cultures and outlooks on life? To address that conundrum, the book lays foundations for a cosmopolitan sociology and shows how it can be applied to examining the cultural, subjective and experiential dimensions of global society. It is a must read for all interested in global studies and cosmopolitanism.\u201d\n\u2013 Pertti Alasuutari, Professor of Sociology, University of Tampere", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73820314, "asset_id": 37874854, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 983327, "first_name": "vincenzo", "last_name": "cicchelli", "domain_name": "ceped", "page_name": "universityParisDescartes", "display_name": "vincenzo cicchelli", "profile_url": "https://ceped.academia.edu/universityParisDescartes?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/983327/354843/15269994/s65_vincenzo.cicchelli.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8031, "name": "Socialization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socialization?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 15838, "name": "Imagination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imagination?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 101074, "name": "Nation-State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nation-State?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 11832067, "title": "Saudade, Duende, and Feedback: The Hybrid Voices of Twenty-First-Century Neoflamenco and Neofado", "created_at": "2015-04-07T10:24:47.448-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11832067/Saudade_Duende_and_Feedback_The_Hybrid_Voices_of_Twenty_First_Century_Neoflamenco_and_Neofado?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_11832067", "summary": "The focus of this comparative, pan-Iberian study is on the negotiation of identity and hybrid cultural production in early twenty-first-century Spain and Portugal. I identify here two subgenres of indie and electronic music scenes and analyze how the handful of musicians that comprise these burgeoning movements are fighting to keep their respective national cultural traditions alive in the face of iTunes, mp3s, and P2P filesharing that have universalized a certain form of pop music which cuts across languages and cultures. The hybrid musicians I interviewed for this project combine flamenco or fado with a variety of indie sounds: rock, pop, power pop, hip hop, trip hop, post punk, spaghetti western, shoegaze, or experimental electronic. The end result is a musical production which simultaneously attempts to voice their nationality as well as their generation. They are the torchbearers of tradition for an Iberian generation raised on The Velvet Underground, David Bowie, The Clash, The Replacements, Nirvana, and The Strokes. Their music references these and other global indie bands alongside those of twentieth century Iberian urban folk icons--Bambino, Camar\u00f3n de la Isla, Enrique Morente, Am\u00e1lia Rodrigues, Alfredo Marceneiro, and Carlos do Carmo. I have developed a framework with which to contextualize and conceptualize the various issues addressed by these bands: authenticity, globalization, nostalgia, cultural capital, national-gender identity, and the economic crisis plaguing contemporary Europe.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37234710, "asset_id": 11832067, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 291663, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Arnold", "domain_name": "umn", "page_name": "MichaelArnold", "display_name": "Michael Arnold", "profile_url": "https://umn.academia.edu/MichaelArnold?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/291663/59133/11265662/s65_michael.arnold.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 671, "name": "Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 687, "name": "Musicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Musicology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 934, "name": "Media and Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1238, "name": "Spanish", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spanish?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1631, "name": "Popular Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Music?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1987, "name": "Ethnomusicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnomusicology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2222, "name": "Portuguese Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portuguese_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2858, "name": "Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Culture?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3351, "name": "Subcultures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subcultures?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4154, "name": "Iberian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iberian_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7125, "name": "Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7948, "name": "The Lusophone World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Lusophone_World?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 16896, "name": "Fado", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fado?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 17198, "name": "Lusophone Cultures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lusophone_Cultures?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 36635, "name": "Contemporary History of Spain", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_History_of_Spain?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 40516, "name": "Spain", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spain?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 44510, "name": "Portugal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portugal?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 46524, "name": "Hispanic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hispanic_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 47389, "name": "Flamenco", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Flamenco?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 53034, "name": "Cultural hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 58166, "name": "Indie Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indie_Music?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 71918, "name": "Patrimonio Cultural", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Patrimonio_Cultural?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 95141, "name": "Spanish Dance and Music (incl.

The article outlines the Western response to hybrid threats and hybrid warfare. It is argued that there is no single response to HT&HW, nor to building resilience.

The voice of researchers who live in post-conflict or conflict-affected societies is still very much restricted by structural, institutional or personal constraints.

An innovative book which explores the everyday lived reality of Muslim minorities in Hong Kong. The contemporary focus is framed by a fascinating history of South Asian Muslims which reaches back into the early 19th century. This beautifully wrought study sheds a great deal of light on a range of issues impacting Muslim minorities: from the extent of hybridity\u2014adapting basketball spaces to cricket\u2014to the challenge of eating halal in a culinary culture where pork is ubiquitous! Young Muslims in Hong Kong face racism and their inability to access Chinese language schools has huge implications for employment and social mobility. However, Islam is respected and they are not seen through a security lens. In all, a hopeful study.\" \u2014Philip Lewis, author of Islamic Britain and Young British and Muslim \r\n\r\n\"There has long been a need for a book-length account of Muslims in Hong Kong; this readable and informative book admirably fills this void. Anyone interested in how Muslims make their lives and practice their faith in the Chinese city of Hong Kong should definitely read it.\" \u2014Gordon Mathews, author of Ghetto at the Center of the World: Chungking Mansions, Hong Kong \r\n\r\n\"In this insightful and fascinating book, O'Connor walks us through the bustling streets of Hong Kong where space, civility, hope and freedom are created every day by the territory's diverse Muslims. It provides a rare glimpse into an imperfect, but perhaps 'good enough' cosmopolitanism, lived in the schools, homes, shops and lives of ordinary people. Amidst the worry and panic about young Muslims in diaspora as either problems or victims, this is a refreshing and much-needed account of the valuable ways a global city deals with difference. An essential text for scholars and students of youth, diversity and contemporary multiculturalism.\" \u2014Anita Harris, author of Young People and Everyday Multiculturalism\r\n\r\nMore than a quarter of a million Muslims live and work in Hong Kong. Among them are descendants of families who have been in the city for generations, recent immigrants from around the world, and growing numbers of migrant workers. Islam in Hong Kong explores the lives of Muslims as ethnic and religious minorities in this unique postcolonial Chinese city. Drawing on interviews with Muslims of different origins, O\u2019Connor builds a detailed picture of daily life through topical chapters on language, space, religious education, daily prayers, maintaining a halal diet in a Chinese environment, racism, and other subjects. Although the picture that emerges is complex and ambiguous, one striking conclusion is that Muslims in Hong Kong generally find acceptance as a community and do not consider themselves to be victimised because of their religion.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1181885, "first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "O'Connor", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "PaulOConnor64", "display_name": "Paul O'Connor", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/PaulOConnor64?f_ri=4138", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 217, "name": "Sociology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Religion?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 546, "name": "Comparative Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Law?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1302, "name": "Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4565, "name": "Law and Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_and_Religion?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 10453, "name": "Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 11151, "name": "American Muslims", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Muslims?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 14970, "name": "Muslims in Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslims_in_Europe?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 16802, "name": "Islamic feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_feminism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 17497, "name": "Sociology of Everyday Life", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Everyday_Life?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 19949, "name": "Chinese Muslims", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Muslims?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 26548, "name": "Religious Persecution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Persecution?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 27673, "name": "Sharia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sharia?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 68505, "name": "Religion and State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_State?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 120722, "name": "Hadith", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hadith?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 120972, "name": "Muslims", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslims?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 182780, "name": "Population Trends", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Population_Trends?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 653618, "name": "Everyday Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Everyday_Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 44119725, "title": "Treatment of Caribbean Colonial Historical Experience in Walcott and Brathwaite's Poetry: Finding the Long Lost 'Root' in the Route", "created_at": "2020-09-19T03:50:01.014-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44119725/Treatment_of_Caribbean_Colonial_Historical_Experience_in_Walcott_and_Brathwaites_Poetry_Finding_the_Long_Lost_Root_in_the_Route?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_44119725", "summary": "This paper attempts to explore the notions that the two Caribbean poets namely, Derek Walcott and Edward Kamau Brathwaite endorse on Caribbean history in their poems. Though both of these poets hold almost the same notion regarding history but their approach is totally different from one another. Coming from a 'hybrid' race, Walcott is aware of the history and he acknowledges it and therefore, he writes in 'mulatto of style'; whereas Brathwaite is enraged by it and attempts to sublimate it to erect a history of the new world. It is Walcott\u2019s view to rise above the delusion and hatred and engulf the world of literature with creativity. On the other hand, Brathwaite holds the grudge which helps him not to forget and forgive the past experience but to transform that very experience into something positive which may help the Caribbean to transform their frustration into something creative and to help the Caribbean to overcome the present struggle against the legacy of colonization. Following discourse analysis, this paper seeks to identify if it is possible to rewrite and re-\u2018right\u2019 the Caribbean history which has been lost in the route and analyze Walcott and Brathwaite\u2019s attitude towards that very history which has been implemented through their poetry.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4772125, "first_name": "G.

To establish such identity, it is a difficult subject because there are multiple historical contributing elements. The Caribbean has many cultural roots. After the European had exterminated the indigenous population, they settled the Caribbean with people around the world and forced them to labor. Thus, people of the Caribbean have extensive backgrounds, making &quot;identity&quot; a problematic topic.

As such, constant changes have also become the new \u201cnormality\u201d in education and social service organisations. It is inherent to organisations to be confronted permanently and simultaneously with different \u2018rationalities\u2019 of their stakeholders. As hybrid organisations, they have to mediate between the logics of governmental, market-based, and societal structures (Brandsen et al., 2005). This is also crucial in the light of the various challenges related to the integration of digital technologies into almost all areas of education and social services and the development of new virtual business cultures within those organisations. Against this background, this paper will discuss the questions of how the process of digital change management must be designed, implemented, and sustainably developed in educational and social service organisations, of what principles of leading such changes could be relied on, and of what leadership the change agents in such a process require specific qualities and competencies. Digital change and innovation continuously include organisational learning, the re-placement of old management practices with more human-centred management activities, the development of new digital literacy skills and leadership competencies, the facilitation of personnel development to mobilise the staff to enact changes in their behaviour, values, and attitudes in volatile environments and uncertain times (Arnold, 2019). Eventually, the paper leads to a discussion and reflection of a sustainable framework for digital change management at the level of the individual change agents, change programs and initiatives, and the organisation itself.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65671276, "asset_id": 45106583, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 303403, "first_name": "Maik", "last_name": "Arnold", "domain_name": "fhd", "page_name": "MaikArnold", "display_name": "Maik Arnold", "profile_url": "https://fhd.academia.edu/MaikArnold?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/303403/74828/39278014/s65_maik.arnold.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 38, "name": "Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Management?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33735, "name": "Digital Learning Resources", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Learning_Resources?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43599, "name": "Community and Social Services", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_and_Social_Services?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 931697, "name": "Innovation & Change Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Innovation_and_Change_Management-1?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 24880208, "title": "McOndo, Magical Neoliberalism and Latin American Identity", "created_at": "2016-04-29T07:54:58.575-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24880208/McOndo_Magical_Neoliberalism_and_Latin_American_Identity?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_24880208", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45201082, "asset_id": 24880208, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 47952533, "first_name": "Rory", "last_name": "O'bryen", "domain_name": "cambridge", "page_name": "RoryObryen", "display_name": "Rory O'bryen", "profile_url": "https://cambridge.academia.edu/RoryObryen?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/47952533/13514888/15189026/s65_rory.o_bryen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12558, "name": "Magical Realism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Magical_Realism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 51610, "name": "Postmodernity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postmodernity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 67306, "name": "Arjun Appadurai", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arjun_Appadurai?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 107145, "name": "Globalizaci\u00f3n", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalizaci%C3%B3n?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 110131, "name": "Alberto Fuguet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alberto_Fuguet?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 171750, "name": "McOndo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/McOndo?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 511009, "name": "Consumption Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Consumption_Culture?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 626612, "name": "Latinamericanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latinamericanism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1839295, "name": "Post-boom latinoamericano", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-boom_latinoamericano?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2523206, "name": "McOndo y Alberto Fuguet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/McOndo_y_Alberto_Fuguet?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3173887, "name": "Magical neoliberalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Magical_neoliberalism?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 38295205, "title": "Skateparks as hybrid elements of the city.pdf", "created_at": "2019-02-06T00:44:52.154-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38295205/Skateparks_as_hybrid_elements_of_the_city_pdf?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_38295205", "summary": "This research argues that the spaces of skateboarding are hybrid.

Intersectionality is the systematic study of the ways in which differences such as race, gender, sexuality, class, ethnicity and other sociopolitical and cultural identities interrelate. Queer theory, when applied as a distinct methodological approach to the study of gender and sexuality, has sought to denaturalise categories of analysis and make normativity visible. By examining existing research projects framed as 'queer' alongside ones that use intersectionality, I consider the importance of positionality in research accounts. I revisit Judith Halberstam's (1998) 'Female Masculinity' and Gloria Anzaldua's (1987) 'Borderlands' and discuss the tension between the act of naming and the critical strategical adoption of categorical thinking. Finally, I suggest hybridity as one possible complementary methodological approach to those of intersectionality and queer studies. Hybridity can facilitate an understanding of shifting textual and material borders and can operate as a creative and political mode of destabilising not only complex social locations, but also research frameworks.\r\nKeywords: intersectionality, hybridity, queer studies", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 11536377, "asset_id": 1478811, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1138615, "first_name": "Aristea", "last_name": "Fotopoulou", "domain_name": "brighton", "page_name": "AristeaFotopoulou", "display_name": "Aristea Fotopoulou", "profile_url": "https://brighton.academia.edu/AristeaFotopoulou?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1138615/464885/26587162/s65_aristea.fotopoulou.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 699, "name": "Queer Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1230, "name": "Social Research Methods and Methodology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Research_Methods_and_Methodology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26743, "name": "Intersectionality and Social Inequality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality_and_Social_Inequality?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 11802235, "title": "Gerhard Preyer, Michael Sussman eds.

Yet, the notion of multiple modernities represents a radical transformation in the way modernity and, indeed, the contemporary world is viewed. As such, the central aim of this volume is to explore the implications and hidden understanding of the multiple modernitites research project beyond historical analysis in order to investigate its wide ranging omnipresent implications as they exist in communication and in the social order of societal membership in contemporary societies. \r\nThis volume collects new research about multiple modernities and globalization. Int shows the new turn of sociological theory in the contemporary scene with respect to multiple modernities, multi-centrism, transglobality, hybridization and multiculturalism, and explores it as a new area of societal communication - one that takes effect in the sectors of a global society as a 'society of societies'. \r\nThe studies in this book converge to demonstrate that the route of Western modernization, its cultural program and iths institutional structure, does not follow the pathway of modernization that we have that far observed in the emerged new area. Rather, the continuation of the multiple modernities research program is given a new design, researching the social structure and dynamic of postmodern societies, their exchange and the the debate about the flow of free resources. \r\n\r\nhttps://brill.com/display/title/32081\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38639466, "asset_id": 11802235, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

Cursed by her fairy mother at a young age, she is forced to transform her body into a half-serpent guise every Saturday. When that monstrous bodily transformation is discovered by her own husband, Raymondin, and subsequently known by her court, the half-fairy woman flies into the sky completely transformed into a flying serpent. While her bodily transformation seems definitive, her wailing and crying into the sky is described by the narrator, and perceived by the internal audience, as the voice of a woman. The connection between body and selfhood through the representation of emotions in the story of M\u00e9lusine resonates with a contemporary audience: while the body of M\u00e9lusine changes, her humanity remains untouched, allowing her to cry human-like tears into the sky of her lands. The transformation of her body does not seem to affect the existence of her selfhood, but only the social perception of it.\nThis paper argues that the metamorphoses of M\u00e9lusine\u2019s  body and the representation of her human-like emotional expression through wailing and tears confirms the existence of a stable, yet malleable, selfhood in the character. The previously deemed human self of M\u00e9lusine is only affected in the eyes of the society that surrounds her thanks to the visible transformation of her body, as it directly alters the (self)narrative created around her.

The European members of the society thought that there were not enough vegetables grown in Bengal and that the commonly eaten vegetables were nutritionally inadequate. In order to 'improve' local vegetable cultivation, the society held a yearly exhibition in which Bengali gardeners received prizes for growing new vegetables, such as cauliflower and cabbage. To supply these exhibitions, the society ordered large shipments of seeds and then distributed them to malis (Bengali gardeners) around Calcutta. In the 1830s they extended this practice to their satellite societies across India. The end result was an increase in the cultivation of these vegetables, and eventually their absorption into local cuisine. Yet, Bengali gardeners continued to bring other vegetables to the exhibitions which were not from the AHSI seed. Eventually, the society's officers reacted to these unsolicited contributions by including awards for them. However, many members were anxious and unsure about these changes, constantly trying to make the vegetable exhibitions mimic the vegetable market at Covent Garden in London. In order to contain the changing exhibitions, they reiterated a divide between 'native' and 'foreign' vegetables by holding separate exhibitions for each. As such, this article reformulates the idea of mimicry, focusing more strongly on British ambivalence and anxiety as they tried to reiterate colonial boundaries with mixed success.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63749213, "asset_id": 43443457, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83556164, "first_name": "Laura", "last_name": "Tavolacci", "domain_name": "unab", "page_name": "LauraTavolacci", "display_name": "Laura Tavolacci", "profile_url": "https://unab.academia.edu/LauraTavolacci?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/83556164/19988432/104500762/s65_laura.tavolacci.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 148, "name": "Botany", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Botany?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1042, "name": "Horticulture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Horticulture?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13390, "name": "History of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Bengal?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 179294, "name": "Mimicry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mimicry?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 208544, "name": "Vegetables", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vegetables?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 41913511, "title": "Hybridity in Peacebuilding?

Instead of considering it as an alternative to liberal peace-building, this work regards hybridity as a logical consequence of it, the same emperor in yet another set of new clothes (Richmond & Franks, 2008). Some of the criticism follows from within the discipline itself, drawing attention to the self-contradictory nature of some claims made by supporters of hybridity as well as the prevalence of established hierarchies and binaries. Another part of the critique targets the limited understanding of hybridity in peacebuilding at its source of post-colonial studies. Last, but not least it attempts to enhance the understanding of hybridity through the intersectional studies aiming at collapsing dominance structures and embracing plurality while realizing that this might as well signals the final stage in the gradual retreat of (liberal) peace-building. The question the thesis would ultimately wish to put, and maybe answer, is whether there is anywhere to go if hybridity fails? Would a response to fundamental criticism and different understandings of hybridity in peacebuilding mean an absolute end to external claims for any form of pre-eminence and whether the recognition of this finality would and should lead to the abandonment of peace-building interventions (in a form that we know them at least)? Albeit the last question seems to be easy to answer, emerging new pragmatist thinking might suggests otherwise (Chandler, 2016). Being an entirely conceptual work, this thesis resorts itself to an analysis of the discourse around hybridity in peacebuilding as well as the possible consequences of its failure.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62039652, "asset_id": 41913511, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25359869, "first_name": "Laura", "last_name": "Faludi", "domain_name": "uni-hamburg", "page_name": "LauraFaludi", "display_name": "Laura Faludi", "profile_url": "https://uni-hamburg.academia.edu/LauraFaludi?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/25359869/6915202/32737923/s65_laura.faludi.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13995, "name": "Postcolonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Theory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24048, "name": "Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30036, "name": "Relationality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Relationality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 45578, "name": "Peacebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peacebuilding?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 41290069, "title": "Les chamanes contemporains - figures d'instabilit\u00e9", "created_at": "2019-12-13T15:33:20.767-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41290069/Les_chamanes_contemporains_figures_dinstabilit%C3%A9?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_41290069", "summary": "Antoine Volodine and Christian Garcin both make a distinctive use of shamanism in fictional novels.

This transgression seemingly results from the versatility of changing artistic interests of Duras, who, while writing, was fascinated by film-making and all possibilities of experimentation. The transgression is confirmed by a kind of polyphony of voices in her works, which makes them both extremely suggestive and open. A prime example of this technique is Le Navire Night. According to the concept of poetical-novelistic or cinematic writing, it can be seen as a \u2018hybrid\u2019 work.

After all, Powers and Lethem are white authors which capitalize on the subject of race. While both novels trace issues of identity and identification which have their origin in the structures of racial ascriptions and self-fashionings, they give a markedly new and critical slant to the mechanisms of testimonial identity politics which Franzen demarcated, without falling back on long-standing postmodern techniques of ironic distancing and de-authentication. \r\n\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 11932189, "asset_id": 1503078, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 426941, "first_name": "Ruth", "last_name": "Mayer", "domain_name": "uni-hannover", "page_name": "RuthMayer", "display_name": "Ruth Mayer", "profile_url": "https://uni-hannover.academia.edu/RuthMayer?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/426941/101410/120521/s65_ruth.mayer.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5579, "name": "Authenticity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Authenticity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 31820, "name": "Jonathan Lethem", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jonathan_Lethem?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54753, "name": "Post-postmodernism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-postmodernism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 59346, "name": "Blackness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Blackness?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 193537, "name": "Richard Powers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Richard_Powers?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 453372, "name": "The Time of Our Singing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Time_of_Our_Singing?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 453373, "name": "The Fortress of Solitude", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Fortress_of_Solitude?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 453375, "name": "Neo-Realiism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neo-Realiism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1176956, "name": "Literature After Postmodernism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature_After_Postmodernism?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 41783887, "title": "Qu'est-ce qu'une proth\u00e8se ? - Concepts et usages", "created_at": "2020-01-30T00:17:11.171-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41783887/Quest_ce_quune_proth%C3%A8se_Concepts_et_usages?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_41783887", "summary": "Les proth\u00e8ses concernent aujourd\u2019hui une majorit\u00e9 d\u2019entre nous et prennent de multiples formes\u00a0: dentaires, visuelles, auditives, mammaires, etc. L\u2019id\u00e9e commune assimile la proth\u00e8se \u00e0 un objet rem\u00e9diant \u00e0 une fonction d\u00e9faillante. Pourtant, certaines proth\u00e8ses, comme les lunettes de soleil ou les proth\u00e8ses mammaires \u00e0 but esth\u00e9tique ne sont pas des rem\u00e8des. Et d\u2019autres objets posent question, comme le m\u00e9dicament ou la greffe. Ce texte a donc pour but de mieux caract\u00e9riser le concept de proth\u00e8se. L\u2019\u00e9tude lexicographique met en avant l\u2019id\u00e9e de remplacement d\u2019une partie d\u00e9faillante du corps, mais elle laisse aussi place \u00e0 des questions d\u2019int\u00e9gration au corps. De m\u00eame, l\u2019arri\u00e8re-plan juridique fait \u00e9tat, \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la cat\u00e9gorie \u00ab\u00a0m\u00e9dicament\u00a0\u00bb, d\u2019une autre, celle des \u00ab\u00a0dispositifs m\u00e9dicaux\u00a0\u00bb, \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur desquels prend place la sous-cat\u00e9gorie des proth\u00e8ses. In fine, l\u2019analyse indique que le concept de proth\u00e8se associe trois noyaux s\u00e9mantiques\u00a0: 1\u00b0 la proth\u00e8se est un dispositif m\u00e9dical\u00a0; 2\u00b0 elle modifie le corps avec un certain niveau d\u2019int\u00e9gration\u00a0; 3\u00b0 elle a une ou plusieurs fonctions, qui peuvent \u00eatre diverses (motrices, sensorielles, neurologiques, psychologiques, sociales, etc.). Concernant le second point \u2013\u00a0l\u2019int\u00e9gration corporelle\u00a0\u2013 une proth\u00e8se est dans une situation interm\u00e9diaire. D\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 elle reste un objet distinct, avec ses propres mat\u00e9riaux et sont propre fonctionnement. De l\u2019autre elle s\u2019int\u00e8gre au corps bien d\u2019avantage qu\u2019un outil quelconque, ce qu\u2019on peut pr\u00e9ciser en \u00e9tudiant cinq dimensions d\u2019int\u00e9gration\u00a0: la place physique, l\u2019int\u00e9gration sensorielle, l\u2019int\u00e9gration motrice, l\u2019int\u00e9gration affective et l\u2019int\u00e9gration expressive. Enfin, il convient de remarquer qu\u2019une des caract\u00e9ristiques de la proth\u00e8se est d\u2019\u00eatre un objet en transit dans ces dimensions d\u2019int\u00e9gration.

While criticism has yet to study Nunez's work from a postcolonial perspective, Even in Paradise reveals two types of narrative discourse: \" postmodern narrative \" intertwined with \" colonial narrative. \" The narrative is \" a perfect zigzag \" journey into the past to comprehend the present. Nunez resists the traditional linear narrative by using a zigzag time and space to defy Western Culture and its controlling structures. Nunez also writes against the postcolonial condition with the attribution of a dominant position in the Caribbean and African culture. Finally, Nunez, a Caribbean writer, writes in English not only to answer back to the colonial discourse but also to challenge the oppressive discourse held by men vis-\u00e1-vis women. Using both tenacious and strong male and female characters while searching for space and identity, she redefines the status of women in a male-dominated world. What is common to many of today's postcolonial authors is their focus on the linguistic hybridity of the national space, the importance of which must be recognized as an asset to postcolonial spaces rather than viewed as a means of dividing the country for the welfare of the ruling few. Drawing from postcolonial theories, I explore Nunez's hybridity as a counter-hegemonic discourse as an example of third space that works to reclaim a space for the subaltern voice.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54758038, "asset_id": 34897185, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2034774, "first_name": "M Kamel", "last_name": "Igoudjil", "domain_name": "american", "page_name": "MKamelIgoudjil", "display_name": "M Kamel Igoudjil", "profile_url": "https://american.academia.edu/MKamelIgoudjil?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2034774/4568306/94657050/s65_m_kamel.igoudjil.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5513, "name": "Narratology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narratology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 10444, "name": "Postmodernism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postmodernism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 24879, "name": "Hegemony", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hegemony?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 73661, "name": "Transculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transculturalism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 96098, "name": "Resistance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Resistance?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 161968, "name": "Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 497223, "name": "Lingusitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lingusitics?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 76995652, "title": "Chinatown unbound: trans-Asian urbanism in the age of China", "created_at": "2022-04-19T14:19:49.015-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/76995652/Chinatown_unbound_trans_Asian_urbanism_in_the_age_of_China?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_76995652", "summary": "Chinatown, as a distinctive urban space, exists in almost all major cities in Western countries.

However, such enthusiastic accounts need to exercise a sense of caution in conceptualizing the fragile and unstable condition of the migrant, and need to distinguish between various experiences of mobility, hybridity, and citizenship. Such a differentiation between these different lived experiences of citizenship echoes Aihwa Ong's critique of the \u2018unified moralism attached to subaltern subjects [that] now also clings to diasporan ones, who are invariably assumed to be members of oppressed classes and therefore constitutionally opposed to capitalism and state power\u2019. My analysis points to how class, race and language structure various experiences of mobility and citizenship and make tenuous easy celebrations of postcolonial hybridity within critical re-configurations of citizenship. I argue that practices of postcolonial mobility in the Franco-Maghrebian context have produced differentiated and unequal hybridities, and, consequently, asymmetrical experiences of citizenship. By distinguishing between various practices of mobility and hybridity, I indicate that postcolonial hybridity can also be employed to re-constitute the rigid boundaries of nation and citizenship.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48334048, "asset_id": 28027559, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 52543561, "first_name": "Alina", "last_name": "Sajed", "domain_name": "mcmaster", "page_name": "AlinaSajed", "display_name": "Alina Sajed", "profile_url": "https://mcmaster.academia.edu/AlinaSajed?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/52543561/13885542/35565042/s65_alina.sajed.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1629, "name": "French Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 12181, "name": "French colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_colonialism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 15863, "name": "Postcolonial Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Literature?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 23398, "name": "Maghreb studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maghreb_studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 54548, "name": "Citizenship studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship_studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 203515, "name": "Immigrant", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigrant?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 25302180, "title": "On Hybridity in African Popular Music: The Case of Senegalese Hip Hop", "created_at": "2016-05-13T08:09:38.240-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/25302180/On_Hybridity_in_African_Popular_Music_The_Case_of_Senegalese_Hip_Hop?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_25302180", "summary": "This article critically considers the legacy of hybridity in African popular music studies and questions whether contemporary African engagements with diasporic popular musics like hip hop call for new interpretations of musical genre.

Deolinda's innocuous revolution is comprised of elliptical and ironic lyrics which whisper of an urgency in the forced stasis of national economic stagnation and which shout against an idle complacency in the self-imposed immobility of the Portuguese millennial generation known as gera\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 rasca (generation scraping by).

The child protagonist perceives the common sense we all share\u2014those ideological structures which are invisible to us precisely due to their transparent and 'natural' position in the existing scheme of things\u2014from a drastically different worldview, one that renders these ideological structures visible as profoundly uncommon and unnatural. Deolinda's adolescent insight has helped to form the foundation of an entire Portuguese youth movement which has taken to the street in protest over the turn-of-the-decade economic crisis and externally imposed austerity measures. Several national journalists have pointed to this protest movement as a template for the Spanish indignados and, therefore, the U.S. occupy movements.

As a result, KSA is seeking to develop and expand its non-oil economy, transitioning into a destination more attractive for visitors and investors. In line with its \u201cSaudi Vision 2030\u201d, a strategic framework to reduce Saudi Arabia\u2019s dependence on oil, diversify its economy, and develop public service sectors such as health, education, infrastructure, recreation, and tourism (https://vision2030.gov.sa/), the country is developing different sectors, revalorising and revitalising its culture and foreseeing a form of modernisation based on a spirit of innovation. This chapter aims to explore how Saudi cultural identity is expressed and negotiated in different discourses regarding food heritage, and how hybridity generates an identity crisis between diversity and integration. In the light of upcoming transformations, how is Saudi cultural identity expressed, constructed, and negotiated in different discourses? Societal changes can occur either as progressive and linear transformations or as abrupt bursts of activity that could affect both the social environment and the country\u2019s image. Change and transformation can be newly built from scratch, or can be a revitalisation of existing identity.

First, the author discusses the peculiar existence of a main character, which, on the internal level of the story told in the book, is full of absence. On the external level, the author focuses on the manner of narration and stage performance (didascalia). His second scope of interest is the lack of author\u2019s unanimous statement concerning the text genre, as well as the interspersion of important elements of drama, theatre and both, pure narrative and music forms. This, recently quite popular phenomenon, has been called hybridity. It allows the juxtaposing of contrasts, joining of contradictions and departures from the accepted specific rules in favour of artistic generic disarray. Moreover, this part of the paper stresses the difference between the original title and its French translation. The extra information added in the French version highlights the lack of precision in the original title. This significantly influences the readers\u2019 choice. The third phenomenon discussed in the article is music. It has its special place among Baricco\u2019s works. In Novecento, music is the second, after the pianist, protagonist. It can be even treated as equally important. However, the lack of a musical code (a proper way of communication) reduces the domination of music. By using a linguistic sign, the author gave music an important function \u2013 being the catalyst and medium between what exists but cannot be seen and what can be felt but cannot be expressed in words. Absence, perceived by human senses and the inadequacy of verbal expression, is elicited through music and, paradoxically, it becomes present.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61625137, "asset_id": 41451148, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 129500398, "first_name": "Qu\u00eates", "last_name": "litt\u00e9raires", "domain_name": "kul", "page_name": "Queteslitteraires", "display_name": "Qu\u00eates litt\u00e9raires", "profile_url": "https://kul.academia.edu/Queteslitteraires?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/129500398/33434805/29795590/s65_qu_tes.litt_raires.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 671, "name": "Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28060, "name": "Hybridity in Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity_in_Music?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 201559, "name": "Contradictions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contradictions?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 320676, "name": "Alessandro Baricco", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alessandro_Baricco?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 703114, "name": "Novecento", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Novecento?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 808459, "name": "Presence/absence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Presence_absence?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 52514985, "title": "The Oxford Handbook of the Study of Religion", "created_at": "2021-09-16T07:46:26.196-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/52514985/The_Oxford_Handbook_of_the_Study_of_Religion?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_52514985", "summary": "This Handbook offers an authoritative and up-to-date survey of original research in the study of religion.

While the work has been previously studied under the light of postcolonial theoretical framework, using the concepts developed by Homi Bhabha to scrutinize the situation and the destiny of the two main hybrid characters, Taras Bulba's sons, takes a step further and reveals the deeply ingrained anxiety and ambivalence in the Cossack mentality.

Im Grunde genommen habe ich drei Schwerpunkte verfolgt. In dem theoretischen Teil versuchte ich dem Leser eine neue Art der gegenw\u00e4rtigen Literatur, die Migrantenliteratur, vorzustellen und zu zeigen, dass diese Literatur \u00fcber viele kulturelle \u00dcberg\u00e4nge verf\u00fcgt, und aus diesem Grund nach einem neuen Rezeptionsvorgang verlangt. Ich setzte mich mit unterschiedlichen kulturwissenschaftlichen Konzepten wie postkoloniale Theorie, Hybridit\u00e4t, Fremdheit, und Heimat auseinander. Zu dieser Neuorientierung und Revision auch innerhalb der Literaturwissenschaft ist es unter dem Einfluss des cultural turns und postkolonial turns gekommen, der vor allem eine Interdisziplinarit\u00e4t zur Folge hat. Aus dem postcolonial turn hat sich sp\u00e4ter die postkoloniale Theorie entwickelt, zu deren Vordenkern man Edward Said und  Homi K. Bhabha z\u00e4hlt. Ich besch\u00e4ftige mich sowohl mit dem Konzept der Hybridit\u00e4t, Mimikry als auch dem Dritten Raum, die zu den Schl\u00fcsselbereichen der postkolonialen Theorie und der daraus entwickelte postkolonialen Literaturwissenschaft geh\u00f6ren.

Cinematography opens up to any digital technological innovations that do not violate a standard model of film experience. Interactivity is seen here as a feature of games and not of films.

Though, as will be seen in the essay, Lebedev's path-breaking maverick effort was largely a shot in the dark, his achievement is seen, in almost the entire theatrical fraternity in West Bengal and Bangladesh, in terms that can be described as larger than life. The essay will seek to understand the extent to which Lebedev's personal and professional choices reflected deep cross-cultural sympathies, thus making him an enthusiast with a difference.

Using both quantitative and qualitative data, this article examines patterns of endogamy and exogamy (i.e., marriage within/outside a particular group or category) among African immigrants in Catalonia, focusing on bi-national Senegalese\u2013 and Gambian\u2013Spanish couples. Socio-demographic profiles, transnationality, the dynamics of cultural change or retention, and the formation of transcultural identities are explored. The evidence presented suggests that social-class factors are more important than cultural origins in patterns of endogamy and exogamy, in the dynamics of living together and in the bringing-up of children of mixed unions. Such a conclusion negates culturalists\u2019 explanations of endogamy and exogamy while, at the same time, emphasising the role of social actors as active subjects in these processes. I further argue that mixed couples and their offspring deal\u2014to a greater or lesser extent\u2014with multiple localisations and cultural backgrounds (i.e. here and there), rather than experiencing a \u2018clash between two cultures\u2019. Therefore, it would be a mistake to pretend that multicultural links do not exist and that they cannot be revitalised and functional.

Case study evidence from newly established social enterprise providers of health and wellbeing services in England is utilised to examine how innovations are shaped by (i) an incumbent state or public sector logic, and two 'challenger' logics relating to (ii) the market and increasing competition; and (iii) civil society, emphasising social value and democratic engagement with employees and service users. The analysis shows how a more fluid and creative interplay of logics can be observed in relation to specific strategies and practices. Within organisations, these strategies relate to the empowerment of staff to be creative, financial management, and knowledge sharing and protection. The interplay of logics shaping social innovation is also found in relationships with key stakeholders, notably public sector funders, service users and service delivery partners.

Hugo made artistic activities from 1820s to 1870s. Most of his works were created while he lived in political exile from 1852 till 1871. Paintings by him on dream and unconsciousness images through automatism so called surrealist\u2019s technique. Andre Breton who is best known as one of the founders of the Surrealist movement in the 20th century declared that Hugo is a \u201cPioneer of Surrealists.\u201d For such a reason, previous studies have concentrated on discovering and analyzing sprouts of surrealism of the 20th century in Hugo\u2019s works. \n   The researcher accepts evaluations and interpretations of previous researchers and tries to pay attention to the fact that Hugo drew Chinese style black ink-wash drawings. When comparing Hugo\u2019s drawings with ink-wash painting in China, we can find some similarities such as \u2018Visual Structure,\u2019 \u2018Composition and Principle,\u2019 \u2018Horizontal Perspective,\u2019 and \u2018Use of India(n) Ink.\u2019 Considering the contemporary popularity of Chinoiserie, Chinese art works that Hugo had and books that he wrote, we can have reasonable suspicion that his works had something to do with Chinese art. \n   Hugo\u2019s artistic viewpoints are highly individual and hybrid as mystic ideas on invisible world and  Oriental taste are mixed up. It is very progressive move in art history and we can say that Hugo is the first modernist and innovative artist as Chareles Baudelaire said. \n\nKeyword: Ink-wash drawing(\uc218\ubb35\ud654), Romanticism, Proto-surrealism, Automatism,  Chinoiserie, Chinese painting, Hybridity, Modernity", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53145607, "asset_id": 33036490, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30751391, "first_name": "Hyojoo", "last_name": "Yang", "domain_name": "mju", "page_name": "HyojooYang", "display_name": "Hyojoo Yang", "profile_url": "https://mju.academia.edu/HyojooYang?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30751391/8968264/16998537/s65_hyojoo.yang.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1258, "name": "Romanticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Romanticism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4951, "name": "Surrealism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Surrealism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8228, "name": "Chinese Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Art?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10758, "name": "Modernity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modernity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 107488, "name": "Chinese Art - Calligraphy & Ink Painting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Art_-_Calligraphy_and_Ink_Painting?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 353083, "name": "Chinoiserie in Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinoiserie_in_Europe?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 16472475, "title": "Prelude to the Birth of Wayo-Secchu (Japanese Hybrid Style) in Japanese Early Modern Architecture", "created_at": "2015-10-05T04:08:18.126-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/16472475/Prelude_to_the_Birth_of_Wayo_Secchu_Japanese_Hybrid_Style_in_Japanese_Early_Modern_Architecture?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_16472475", "summary": "This paper will investigate the background of the emergence of Wayo-secchu, by re-examining the rhetoric of the government-oriented early Meiji Western style architecture and Japanese traditionalisms reaction to it.

In this article, I propose a heroic cycle which consist of three different heroic types creators use to cope with events in reality. This cycle consists of the classic hero, the flawed hero, and the contemporary (post 9/11) type of hero which will be defined and described as a hybrid hero. This hybrid hero became very popular in recent years and just as its counterpart, the franchised hero tries with a specific set of characteristics and moral frameworks, to provide a jouissance for audiences (Barthes, 1975). By doing so, these heroes try to sooth, entertain, or challenge their audiences. Both the hybrid and the franchised hero focus on the reception by audiences although their means and behavior differ on many levels. Although the research and development of the hybrid hero is still at its initial stage, this article elaborates on its construction and conceptualizations as fictional character and as moral challenger in today's fiction. The hybrid hero challenges both audience and creators on empathic, moral, and narrative levels and is a contemporary symbiosis of heroic and villainous features.

He has received accolades for being a singer, musician, songwriter, producer, actor and even director. His overwhelming popularity is not confined to the music industry as he has crossed over to the film industry and acted in eight national and international films. Chou\u2019s stardom is unprecedented as no other stars have generated similar impact in the East Asia\u2019s entertainment industry. Looking at his impressive achievements, one cannot help but ask, \u201cWhy is Chou so successful?\u201d Organised in four parts, this paper aims to investigate the factors that propel Chou to stardom and establish him as the most iconic star in East Asia. Firstly, using Richard Dyer\u2019s theory of star image, the relationship between Chou\u2019s star image and his charisma is examined. This paper posits that Chou\u2019s star image is a hybrid of \u201cmodern\u201d and \u201ctraditional\u201d qualities based on his representation of contemporary notion like \u201ccool\u201d and traditional aspects of Chinese values. Next, this paper proceeds to apply Homi Bhabha\u2019s concept of hybridity to analyse how Chou has altered the landscape of East Asia\u2019s music industry with his hybrid star image and distinctive \u201cChou Style\u201d music. The term \u201cChou Style\u201d is used to describe Chou\u2019s unique brand of music that consists of an innovative hybrid of musical styles. Through a detailed analysis of his musical style, this paper focuses on how Chou has combined Western musical styles like R&B, rap and rock with Chinese musical styles and cultural themes to create a new genre of \u201cChina Wind\u201d music. Thirdly, the commodification of Chou\u2019s stardom is explored through a study of his product endorsements and music concerts. Extending David Marshall\u2019s discussion on the interactions between celebrities and their capital formation, this paper explores how Chou\u2019s stardom is commoditised into cultural and economic capital. Chou\u2019s stardom facilitates the marketing of his star image, and through this process, his hybrid star image and music become commoditised. The last section of this paper investigates Chou\u2019s crossover from music to film through an analysis of his significant films. Chou\u2019s progression from a music to a film star is examined through an analysis of his appearances in his prominent films. The dynamics between Chou\u2019s star image and music facilitates the development of his stardom based on a hybrid model of Chou as both a music and film star. Finally, this paper concludes by looking at the impact of Chou\u2019s success on East Asia\u2019s entertainment industry. Chou has revitalised the Chinese popular music industry with his \u201cChou Style\u201d as his hybrid style of music has become a \u201cformula\u201d for success. Under Chou\u2019s influence, hybridity has become a \u201cformula\u201d for generating new types of music in the Chinese popular music industry. Ultimately, Chou\u2019s success in East Asia marks a new and exciting chapter in the Chinese music and film industry.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37773688, "asset_id": 12672674, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 368452, "first_name": "Wendy", "last_name": "Ng", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "WendyNg", "display_name": "Wendy  Ng", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/WendyNg?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/368452/11305448/12612817/s65_wendy.ng.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1056, "name": "Popular Music Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Music_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1631, "name": "Popular Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Music?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2858, "name": "Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Culture?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6527, "name": "Celebrity Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Celebrity_Culture?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 14265, "name": "Chinese Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Music?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 26609, "name": "Chinese Popular Culture and Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Popular_Culture_and_Globalization?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 28060, "name": "Hybridity in Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity_in_Music?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 53034, "name": "Cultural hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 69253, "name": "Stardom and Celebrity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stardom_and_Celebrity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 74525, "name": "Theory of Cultural Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theory_of_Cultural_Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 122738, "name": "Stardom and celebrity culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stardom_and_celebrity_culture?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 123261, "name": "Celebrity Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Celebrity_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 229108, "name": "Chinese media: entertainment television, popular music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_media_entertainment_television_popular_music?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 378783, "name": "Mandopop, Taiwan popular music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mandopop_Taiwan_popular_music?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 439013, "name": "Contemporary Stardom", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Stardom?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 463678, "name": "Chinese Language Media and Film East Asian Popular Culture Stardom and Celebrity Culture, Mediasphere in Shanghai, New Urban Culture in Postsocialist China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Language_Media_and_Film_East_Asian_Popular_Culture_Stardom_and_Celebrity_Culture_Mediaspher?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 705505, "name": "Contemporary Chinese Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Chinese_Music?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 4092309, "title": "\"The Korean Way of Tea: An Introductory Guide\" by Brother Anthony of Taiz\u00e9 and Hong Kyeong-Hee ", "created_at": "2013-07-23T16:50:56.239-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4092309/_The_Korean_Way_of_Tea_An_Introductory_Guide_by_Brother_Anthony_of_Taiz%C3%A9_and_Hong_Kyeong_Hee?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_4092309", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48125840, "asset_id": 4092309, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 692632, "first_name": "Lauren W.", "last_name": "Deutsch", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "LaurenWDeutsch", "display_name": "Lauren W.

First of all, the introductory notes on postcolonial approach, colonial history of Australia and Noonuccal are presented and then postcolonial key terms including Hybridity, Third Space and Otherization are employed to read the selected poems with the purpose of highlighting the anticolonial inclinations in them. Throughout the study, Third Space which comes as a result of hybrid cultures is emphasized as a background for reflecting and reinforcing Aboriginal tendency in Australia. The valiant attempts waging the anticolonial struggles in Oodgeroo Noonuccal's poetry include expounding a view of history from the perspective of the colonized, pointing to the disappearance of Aboriginal culture and tradition and their revival, protesting against the states' unjust policies the regarding the Aborigines, putting an end to Otherization, and issuing a call for a just integration of blacks and whites.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63171942, "asset_id": 42921000, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 150383245, "first_name": "Critical Literary Studies", "last_name": "(CLS)", "domain_name": "uok", "page_name": "CriticalLiteraryStudiesCLS", "display_name": "Critical Literary Studies (CLS)", "profile_url": "https://uok.academia.edu/CriticalLiteraryStudiesCLS?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/150383245/41809927/39659820/s65_critical_literary_studies._cls_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15863, "name": "Postcolonial Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Literature?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27997, "name": "Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Literature?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 73367, "name": "Poems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poems?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3641943, "name": "Oodgeroo Noonuccal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oodgeroo_Noonuccal?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 8468330, "title": "Market Place: Food Quarters, Design and Urban Renewal in London, Susan Parham (2012)", "created_at": "2014-09-23T23:15:12.350-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8468330/Market_Place_Food_Quarters_Design_and_Urban_Renewal_in_London_Susan_Parham_2012_?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_8468330", "summary": "Since the early 1990s, the study of food and cities has become a much more central concern in a range of academic disciplines. Increasingly, there is research interest in the gastronomic possibilities of urban space (Zukin 1995, 1998) focusing on how food can offer positive support for making cities sustainable by nurturing convivial food spaces and practices. \r\nA significant area for investigation is the double-sided nature of \u2018food quarters\u2019 and the questions these raise for planning research that delves into their real character. While the emergence of new kinds of food spaces and practices may underpin positive sustainability, food-centred regeneration may also lead to either the increasing commodification of space based on food and design improvements, or to gentrification, where food is part of the place marketing strategy. These discrepancies between convivial intentions and its paradoxical effects have become subjects of heated debate among planners and policymakers. For example, how is it that food quarters have operated simultaneously as zones of gentrification that may have excluded some, yet equally appeared to defy dominant spatial trends that are producing food related sprawl and \u2018obesegenic\u2019 environments (Lake and Townshend 2006)? How is it that they have developed in a more convivial, gastronomically rich and sustainable way than some other areas? Can the benefits they offer involve people of all classes or are they for gentrification\u2019s winners? \r\nAgainst the backdrop of these questions and debates, Market Place: Food Quarters, Design and Urban Renewal in London critically examines the renewal of three food-centred spaces in formerly rundown areas of London \u2013 Borough, Broadway and Exmouth Markets \u2013 and questions why food quarters have emerged in each place, becoming paradoxically the loci for food-led gentrification. In exploring these quarters, the book has also reflected and drawn theoretically upon an increasing interest in food, the body and everyday life within sociology (Amin and Thrift 2002, 2004; Beardsworth and Keil 1997; Lupton 1996; Zukin 1995).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40589831, "asset_id": 8468330, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 451933, "first_name": "Lidia K.C.", "last_name": "Manzo", "domain_name": "unimi", "page_name": "LidiaKCManzo", "display_name": "Lidia K.C.

In this paper I argue that John\u2019s stylization of Jesus\u2019 death both participates in and subverts aspects of the Romana mors. I first outline the imperial configuration of honor, and then I analyze the anti-imperial rhetoric in Plutarch\u2019s narration of the Roman republican martyr Cato. Finally, I examine John\u2019s portrayal of Jesus\u2019 death, showing how it rhetorically resonates with other glorious Roman deaths, and yet ideologically subverts them by configuring glory around Jesus\u2019 crucifixion. As such, John\u2019s hybridized discourse of Jesus\u2019 anti-violent laying down of his life in love enunciates a radical reconfiguration of social life, freed from imperial violence.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62276577, "asset_id": 5237618, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5656451, "first_name": "Jason J.", "last_name": "Ripley", "domain_name": "stolaf", "page_name": "JasonJRipley", "display_name": "Jason J.

It investigates how various generations have recorded their family memories on film, video and digital media, and, more specifically, how changes in these \u201ctechnologies of memory\u201d have shaped new forms of home movie making and screening. Covering the period from the invention of the film camera in the late nineteenth century, the introduction of 9.5mm, 16mm, 8mm small-gauges and Super 8 film technologies for amateurs, via home video to digital media technologies, this study addresses the complex interrelations between the materiality of film, video and digital media technologies, their social usages and cultural meanings from a long-term historical perspective. Focusing on specific periods of transition, it becomes clear that different media technologies, user practices and discourses not only succeed each other in time, but also increasingly interrelate, interact or even transform each other. Maintaining both a diachronic and a synchronic perspective on media transitions, this dissertation proposes an alternative form of media historiography that rethinks media histories beyond the frameworks of change and continuity by perceiving hybridity as a constant factor in media historical development.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55535064, "asset_id": 35664434, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8358919, "first_name": "Tim", "last_name": "van der Heijden", "domain_name": "ou-nl", "page_name": "TimvanderHeijden", "display_name": "Tim van der Heijden", "profile_url": "https://ou-nl.academia.edu/TimvanderHeijden?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8358919/2851098/11106485/s65_tim.van_der_heijden.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 928, "name": "Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 939, "name": "Media Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Archaeology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2972, "name": "Media History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8536, "name": "Hybridization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridization?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 44864, "name": "Home movies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_movies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 79532, "name": "Amateur Film", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amateur_Film?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 79939797, "title": "Fairy Tale, Tragedy, Fantastic: Three Generic Exceptions in the Short Stories of Anita Desai", "created_at": "2022-05-25T23:11:15.187-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/79939797/Fairy_Tale_Tragedy_Fantastic_Three_Generic_Exceptions_in_the_Short_Stories_of_Anita_Desai?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_79939797", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86487419, "asset_id": 79939797, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 15757204, "first_name": "Elsa", "last_name": "Lorphelin", "domain_name": "paris-sorbonne", "page_name": "ElsaLorphelin", "display_name": "Elsa Lorphelin", "profile_url": "https://paris-sorbonne.academia.edu/ElsaLorphelin?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/15757204/6421422/7263392/s65_elsa.lorphelin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1236, "name": "Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2418, "name": "Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3125, "name": "Genre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genre?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 56163, "name": "Otherness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Otherness?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 93277, "name": "POSTCOLONIAL", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/POSTCOLONIAL?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 158573, "name": "Short Stories", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Short_Stories?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 162873, "name": "Anita Desai", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anita_Desai?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 39959871, "title": "The copy as original: the presence of the absent Spanish Habsburg king and colonial hybridity", "created_at": "2019-07-29T05:51:29.679-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39959871/The_copy_as_original_the_presence_of_the_absent_Spanish_Habsburg_king_and_colonial_hybridity?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_39959871", "summary": "The political culture that defined the Spanish empire was made up of elements that, borrowing from their different points of contact, travelled the world\u2010around being transformed in the process into a mixed style that defied a clear origin (or original).

Whitechapel gallery provides a rare opportunity to see a collection of Hoch's work, beginning as a trained applied artist through to her drawings in old age and discussing how deep secrets lie in abstraction. The exhibition has an air of the happily ever after. But if we're honest, are we looking for this from our artists. It seems the exhibition focuses on her abstract period suggesting it is the apex of her career, and that in the removal of realism one comes closer to an essence, or 'truth', however this is habitual theory and one I wish to challenge. What is most evident here is that Hoch's strength in fact lies in her work's effortless simplicity and cohesiveness that boldly combines strong statement with whimsy. Although the parts may seem na\u00efve their seamless assemblage and effortlessness makes them all the more unnerving. The colour pallet is harmonious and the chaos of post war Europe seems to have given her a clarity as she poetically reveals the absurdity of political facades and idealised stereotypes. At a time when Germany lay in a state of classification mania Hoch states her concern with dissolving ''the firm boundaries that we human beings so self assuredly are inclined to erect around everything'. Through bold assemblages of figures provoke challenging new relationships between its fragmented parts, as did European artists Jan Svankmajer, Jans Lenica and Walerian Borowczyk use a device, however the importance of their work is rarely appreciated as widely as it deserves to be. The exhibition begins by showing her emerging from conventional training but soon grotesque, fairytale-\u00ad\u2010like illustrations of her society begin to scramble from the walls and contaminate your senses. One of the most important collage artists of 20 th century Hoch exploits the power art carries, believing that art was a powerful vehicle for change, and in this prolific period she does just that as her work questions the construction of societies' ideas of reality and beauty. Further in to the exhibition the space is populated by dreamlike and carnivalesque figures, and amongst her winged ministers and hybrid beauties one cannot shake associations to Kafka's six-\u00ad\u2010 legged protagonist. Perversely as you ascend in to the second part of the exhibition the energy seems to dissipate. Here the work is noticeably more abstract and painterly, as if she has returned to the more formal elements of her textile past. The vast examples of abstraction left me feeling a little cold and asking why narrative has become such a dirty word? (and perhaps one which sullied artists such as Lenica) It is as if its believed that in becoming increasingly detached from the figure one gets closer to some true essence or meaning, when in fact the human element can engage it with its society and provide it with a great power.

open-ended\nand hybrid play concept: Comicubes \u2013 a platform for play, playtesting\nand simultaneously tool to stimulate (design) creativity. We\npropose a hybrid concept that interweaves the ideas of comics and\nthree-dimensional toys together. The concept challenges the\ntraditional idea of comics as images that are read one after another\nby suggesting a more open reading paralleling the interpretation\nand use of and a physically manipulable toy object.

Cette derni\u00e8re met plut\u00f4t l\u2019accent sur la communication de messages au d\u00e9triment de la cr\u00e9ation de formes. En analysant ces pratiques, nous voulons mieux les comprendre pour en tenir compte dans l\u2019enseignement des arts et du fran\u00e7ais, et favoriser des pratiques \u00e0 la fois sensibles et porteuses de messages.

The latter rather focuses on communicating messages at the expense of the creation of forms. By analyzing these practices, we want to better understand and integrate them in the teaching of arts and language, to foster practices that are both sensitive and carriers of significant messages. Our sensory ethnography approach includes questionnaires and interviews on the creative/receptive practices of young people and artists. \n\nOur preliminary analyses show the need to link these practices, redefine creation and develop new teaching strategies that encourage hybridity/multimodality in arts and language. In this article, we present our research problem, analytical framework and methodological approach; we analyse three cases and present three artistic practices; we conclude on the importance of developing a pedagogy informed by youth\u2019s informal learning.\n\nCet article est issu de la Revue de recherches en litt\u00e9ratie m\u00e9diatique multimodale.

The juxtaposition of purportedly value-free scientific practices with a value-laden indigenous epistemology exposes the former's debatable characterisation as \u2018objective'.

divine. The liminal zone of the altarpiece is explored through Crivelli\u2019s amalgams of media and matter, in which ontological categories blur to suggest continuities between different realms of existence. Living and nonliving, natural and artificial echo each other, resulting in hybrid states of being and signaling the interdependence of figure and ornament. The writings of Thomas Aquinas shed light on Crivelli\u2019s artistic process, in which the combination of preexisting forms to produce new compositions follows the principles of rhetorical inventio. It is suggested that Crivelli\u2019s representational system appealed to the contemplative practices of his Dominican viewers, triggering them to reflect upon the mysteries of God\u2019s created universe. The essay concludes that Crivelli\u2019s hybrid assemblages dissolve boundaries and enhance the capacity of the saints to act as intercessors.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73633042, "asset_id": 59987116, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31209612, "first_name": "Amanda", "last_name": "Hilliam", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "amandahilliam", "display_name": "Amanda Hilliam", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/amandahilliam?f_ri=4138", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16226, "name": "Materiality (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Materiality_Anthropology_?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19041, "name": "Dominican History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dominican_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 294652, "name": "Carlo Crivelli", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Carlo_Crivelli?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 785916, "name": "Visual Exegesis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Exegesis?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 39645124, "title": "\"Otherbreath: Bare Life and the Limits of Self in Claudia Rankine's 'Citizen'\"", "created_at": "2019-06-20T09:49:05.321-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39645124/_Otherbreath_Bare_Life_and_the_Limits_of_Self_in_Claudia_Rankines_Citizen_?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_39645124", "summary": "\"Extreme Texts\" special issue, edited by Divya Victor.

The latter focused on two digital screens in particular \u2013 computer and smartphone screens \u2013 and specifically on how content circulates between them. Our study comprises analysis of the log books kept in April 2011 by Master 1 students in Information and Communication Science, aged from 21 to 26 years old, who hailed from three different streams (Research, Multimedia and Com- munication and Generations).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37399948, "asset_id": 2016882, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

Woolf deployed in her shorter prose to blur the edges between the essay and the short story, in particular in those essayistic specimens that present some markedly imaginative features which undermine the ideal of the essay as a \u00abbrief, nonfictional prose piece\u00bb. Woolf is justly renowned for her programmatic and unrelenting research of new expressive codes, and for her experimentation with the boundaries between different genres. As far as short prose is concerned, she successfully breaks the borders between the argumentative and the narrative, to aim at a compromise form that draws its essence both from fiction and nonfiction. By means of a close reading of some of the most representative of her short stories and essays, my paper wishes to be a starting point for a broader reflection to ascertain how the blending of different stylistic features was not just a literary affectation of modernist literature, but a practice which reflected a deeply rooted need to discover alternative paths in literature. In the specific case of the genetic contaminations between essay writing and short narratives, this creative experimentation can fruitfully be compared to Musil\u2019s idea of essayism. The Death of the Moth, Street Haunting and many other examples thus allow a renegotiation of generic boundaries, a reassessment of the ideal types that, in a common mentality, represent the model for the two prose genres that act as the extremes of the genetic spectrum which is the subject of the analysis at hand.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46138054, "asset_id": 19899523, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2792488, "first_name": "Paolo", "last_name": "Bugliani", "domain_name": "uniroma2", "page_name": "PaoloBugliani", "display_name": "Paolo Bugliani", "profile_url": "https://uniroma2.academia.edu/PaoloBugliani?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2792488/914163/89805663/s65_paolo.bugliani.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8452, "name": "Virginia Woolf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Virginia_Woolf?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16499, "name": "Genre Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genre_Theory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23577, "name": "Short story (Literature)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Short_story_Literature_?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33162, "name": "Essay (Genre Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Essay_Genre_Theory_?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 38084684, "title": "MALAYSIAN HYBRIDITY: ISSUES OF KINSHIP PRACTICES AND IDENTITY CRISIS", "created_at": "2019-01-03T21:17:54.351-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38084684/MALAYSIAN_HYBRIDITY_ISSUES_OF_KINSHIP_PRACTICES_AND_IDENTITY_CRISIS?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_38084684", "summary": "In this work, the research aim was to explore how hybridity affects/cause identity crisis as an issue of kinship practices among Euro-Asian families in Malaysia.

presentations. This special issue is driven by the belief that still more could be done at the level of theorizing arts-based research practices, and at the level of deploying them in different contexts. The aim of this special issue is to further stimulate the discussion on this topic, bringing together a diversity of voices, formats and approaches. In order to translate this objective into practice, a very strict (and restrictive) definition of arts-based research was avoided. Instead, all contributions that allowed for an artistic-academic dialogue on arts, academia and research were welcomed. This became translated into an intentionally-kept-vague structure, with more general reflective texts first, and then a series of more case-study-based approaches and more targeted and specific discussions, divided into a cluster on participation and interaction on the one hand, and mediation on the other. For the very same purpose, also a variety of formats was welcomed, including multimodal formats, more artistic contributions and policy-oriented statements, even though all contributors were asked for relatively short contributions, to maximize the diversity of voices. This strategy produced a variety of contributions that aim to inspire researchers in the field of Communication and Media Studies, and beyond, to reflect about the potentialities (and limitations) of arts-based research, and to consider adapting some of these approaches and methods in their own academic practice.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66260034, "asset_id": 46840301, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13409550, "first_name": "Comunicazioni Sociali.", "last_name": "Journal of Media, Performing Arts and Cultural Studies", "domain_name": "unicatt", "page_name": "ComunicazioniSociali", "display_name": "Comunicazioni Sociali.

Located within a region that presents security challenges viewed through the lens of the global war on terror, she hosts numerous external actors such as the UN, and INGOs whose impact on the development landscape beyond relief is questionable. However, critical engagement or interest in Somaliland beyond the state building/state formation analysis is limited. I argue that outside this oft cited example, there is need to critically engage with other ongoing processes which have a liberal agenda. This offers both a nuanced critique and highlights the limitations and challenges of interventions within such contexts. The paper draws on empirical research undertaken between 2010 and 2012; other studies and draws on critical liberal peacebuilding literature. It concludes by challenging the limited focus by critics calling for focus on other marginal contexts.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56655489, "asset_id": 36714948, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 52358324, "first_name": "Sarah", "last_name": "Njeri", "domain_name": "kcl", "page_name": "SNjeri", "display_name": "Sarah Njeri", "profile_url": "https://kcl.academia.edu/SNjeri?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/52358324/19809678/19642304/s65_sarah.njeri.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26151, "name": "Liberal Peacebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liberal_Peacebuilding?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 359380, "name": "Mine Action", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mine_Action?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 441263, "name": "Somalia and Somaliland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Somalia_and_Somaliland?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 931986, "name": "Post Conflict Issues", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post_Conflict_Issues?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 9813630, "title": "Governance without Government in Syria: Civil Society and State-Building during Conflict ", "created_at": "2014-12-17T09:14:34.453-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9813630/Governance_without_Government_in_Syria_Civil_Society_and_State_Building_during_Conflict?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_9813630", "summary": "Post-conflict knowledge and practice regarding effective governance reconstitution is still in its infancy; during conflict, it is even more minimal. In conflict-torn states, it is still debatable that state building has become synonymous to re-establishing governance -thus peace; and that civil society has become a protagonist in this process. More consensus, nevertheless, has been reached in literature regarding the yet limited capability to deal with conflict. One of the most alarming conflicts in modern history that requires such improved academic understanding during conflict itself is the Syrian case. Syria\u2019s conflict presents complex governance dynamics and state building interests. Syria is witnessing the rise of both civil societies and extremist groups in the midst of civil wars, proxy wars and popular uprisings against authoritarianism. \r\n\r\nThis article aims to provide an insight into the yet misunderstood dynamics of governance during conflict, as it focuses on the non-government-controlled parts of Syria. The article pays particular attention to the agency of civil society vis-\u00e0-vis other local and international state building interests. It bases its analysis on a theoretical framework centred on the notion of \u201chybridity\u201d. In two different sections, the article analyses the extent to which governance is a hybrid of, first, old and new governance imbalances and, second, of local and international forces. Governance imbalance is seen in light of the state-market-civil society developmental model. Meanwhile, the governance of local and international forces during conflict is measured following three dimensions: effectiveness, legitimacy and security. A third section is then dedicated to case studies of three non-government-controlled-areas in Syria: Al-Raqqa, Dair Ezzor and Aleppo. With a historical and contextual snapshot of the changing dynamics during conflict in these areas, this section studies the agency of civil society versus other more powerful governance actors on the ground. The cases are supported by data from an intensive qualitative and quantitative field research of over 6 months expanding until May 2014. \r\n\r\nThe research findings suggest that while the different factors, forces and interests in the Syrian conflict coexist and cooperate, both the old and the new, the grass-roots and the top-down, the civil and the uncivil governance become hybridised. The result, nonetheless, continues to derive unbalanced governance between the key actors in the state, civil society and market spheres. This necessitates a more holistic historical and contextual understanding of the continuously changing nature of governance during conflict. It requires better insight into the relationships and dynamics between the actors at the local and international levels. It also implies the need for better cooperation with local civil societies following an approach tailored more closely to their rights, motives, nature, needs and governance realities on the ground.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38058385, "asset_id": 9813630, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 23381693, "first_name": "Rana", "last_name": "Khalaf", "domain_name": "manchester", "page_name": "RanaKhalaf", "display_name": "Rana Khalaf", "profile_url": "https://manchester.academia.edu/RanaKhalaf?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/23381693/6351748/13039608/s65_rana.khalaf.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2015, "name": "Middle East Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_East_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3849, "name": "Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4424, "name": "Post-conflict Reconstruction and Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-conflict_Reconstruction_and_Development?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5102, "name": "Regional and Local Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Regional_and_Local_Governance?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 6914, "name": "Syrian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Syrian_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 15391, "name": "Syria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Syria?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 18623, "name": "Middle East Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_East_Politics?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 19200, "name": "Post-Conflict State Building", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Conflict_State_Building?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 20520, "name": "Peace & Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies-3?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 21852, "name": "Governance and Civil Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Governance_and_Civil_Society?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 41942, "name": "State-building in the Failed States", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/State-building_in_the_Failed_States?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 60519, "name": "Nonviolent Civil Resistance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nonviolent_Civil_Resistance?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 146852, "name": "Post-Conflict Reconstruction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Conflict_Reconstruction?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 185157, "name": "Isis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Isis?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 313634, "name": "Aleppo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aleppo?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 401751, "name": "Raqqa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Raqqa?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 512540, "name": "Post Conflict Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post_Conflict_Development?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 526385, "name": "Politics, Political Psychology, International Relations, International Rule of Law and Human Rights,Media and Communication, Conflict Studies, Conflict Reporting, Conflict Resolution, and  Post War Reconstruction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_Political_Psychology_International_Relations_International_Rule_of_Law_and_Human_Rights_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1023358, "name": "Social Movements/Civil Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Movements_Civil_Society?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 41289874, "title": "Hybridit\u00e9 et alt\u00e9rit\u00e9 dans Magnus de Sylvie Germain", "created_at": "2019-12-13T15:02:42.803-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41289874/Hybridit%C3%A9_et_alt%C3%A9rit%C3%A9_dans_Magnus_de_Sylvie_Germain?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_41289874", "summary": "Magnus, a novel from Sylvie Germain published in 2005, is a narration made up of several marks of hybridity \u2013 structural, generic and discursive hybridity.

It is an expectation that the contemporary nature writer will engage and form connections with the natural and cultural entities of a place, prior to constructing a narrative. These bodily experiences are expressed through the act of writing in order to explore the value of non-human nature and the complexity of human relationships with nature/culture. However, a multi-layering of nature/culture occurs in the production of nature writing. The text not only acts as expression of bodily engagement with the world but also presents the reader with a means of experiencing and connecting with place. I will discuss the notions of hybridity and embodiment as methodological tools for the nature writer with reference to Nigel Krauth\u2019s work on writing from the body as well as contemporary renegotiations of Donna Haraway\u2019s cyborg, and Janet Frame\u2019s Living in the Maniototo.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33839643, "asset_id": 7216371, "asset_type": "Work",

Trotz der langen Tradition stellt die gemeinsame Erscheinung und wechselseitige Durchdringung von Literatur und bildender Kunst noch heute ein aktuelles Forschungsfeld f\u00fcr Sprachphilosophie, -wissenschaft und Kunst dar.  Eine weitgehende \u00dcbereinstimmung ist in der Literatur wahrzunehmen: \u201eDie Literatur gelangt dabei in der visuellen Poesie zum sprachlosen Bild, in Wort-Bild-Texten bezieht sie Fotos und Grafik mit ein, in multi-medialen Aktionen wird sie zum Bestandteil eines optischen und akustischen Environments\u201c[1].  Gegenstand der vorliegenden Arbeit ist vornehmlich die Betrachtung des Ph\u00e4nomens der Ikonisierung von Sprache[2]bzw. der Eingliederung von der bildenden Kunst in schriftliche Werke und insbesondere der Verbildlichung literarisch-typographischer Materialien bei den Parole in libert\u00e0 [= befreiten Worten/ W\u00f6rtern \u2013 befreiter Sprache[3] des italienischen Futurismus.\n\nDie Komplexit\u00e4t der futuristischen Bildsprache[4] stellt heutige Leser vor eine doppelte Herausforderung: Einerseits setzen die futuristischen Bildtexte[5] ein geeignetes kulturgeschichtliches Kontextwissen voraus, das die in den einzelnen Werken jeweils vorausgesetzten Wissens- und Verstehenshorizonte er\u00f6ffnet, andererseits stellen sie eine Verbindung zu sp\u00e4teren bild- und zeichentheoretischen Debatten bis in die Gegenwart her: Dabei sind sie unter medientheoretischen und semiotischen Gesichtspunkten als hybride Gattung zu erschlie\u00dfen, als Medien-Kunst, und zwar als \u201aMedien\u2019 f\u00fcr die Vermittlung einer Mitteilung und als \u201aKunst\u2019 auf der (selbstreferentiellen) \u00e4sthetisch-semiotischen Ebene.  Hier setze ich mir zum Ziel, herauszuarbeiten, inwieweit visuelle (graphische) und verbale Elemente in der futuristischen Bildsprache ineinander greifen, und inwiefern diese \u201aVernetzung\u2019 von Schrift und Bild als \u201eAntwort der Literatur\u201c auf das ver\u00e4nderte Wahrnehmungsverm\u00f6gen des Menschen in der Zeit der Technik und der revolutionierenden wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse der Physik und Mathematik \u2013 hundert Jahre vor dem \"Global Denken\u201c \u2013 sowie auf die zunehmende Komplexit\u00e4t der zwischenmenschlichen Kommunikation angesehen werden darf. Die aus der futuristischen Sprachbefreiung (Manfred Kohrt) entstandene Bildsprache soll dabei auf seine Relevanz f\u00fcr unser Verst\u00e4ndnis des Menschen in der \u201eschnellen Zeit der Maschinen\u201c und seiner Weise, sich literarisch auszudr\u00fccken, \u00fcberpr\u00fcft werden.\n\nWas die Struktur und Vorgehensweise betrifft,  ist die vorliegende Arbeit in zwei Hauptteile gegliedert. Der erste, aus vier Kapitel bestehende Hauptteil, behandelt die theoretischen Grundlagenf\u00fcr die Entstehung der italienischen futuristischen Bewegung und insbesondere ihrer k\u00fcnstlerischen Revolution der \u201cBefreiung des Wortes\u201d und der daraus entstandenen Literatur des sogenannten Paroliberismus, der nach Faust \u201eden wichtigsten Beitrag\u201c darstellt, \u201eden der Futurismus in die Entwicklung der modernen Literatur und insbesondere der Visuellen Poesie einbrachte\u201c.[6] Diesem einf\u00fchrenden Kapitel mit der Pr\u00e4sentation des Vorhabens folgt ein knapper kulturhistorischer Abriss, der das literarische Ph\u00e4nomen in seinen kultur-historischen Kontext setzt. Das 3. Kapitel bietet eine Einf\u00fchrung in die Geschichte und Entwicklung des Konzeptes von Bildsprache an, wobei historische Vorl\u00e4ufer des Paroliberismus sowiedurch ihn \u2013 mit Bezug auf die Kombination von Schrift und Bild \u2013 beeinflusste sp\u00e4tere literarische und intermediale Ph\u00e4nomene \u00fcberblickend dargestellt werden. Daran anschlie\u00dfend werden im 4. Kapitel anhand von Manifesten und theoretischen Schriften die programmatischen Elemente der futuristischen Bewegung erl\u00e4utert bzw. die Kernthesen von Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, die besondere Bedeutung f\u00fcr die Bearbeitung und Gestaltung einer literarischen Sprache haben, kritisch dargestellt.\n\nUm das theoretische Wissen mit der \u201ePraxis\u201c (= den konkreten Werken) zu vergleichen und die Merkmale der futuristischen Bildsprache exemplarisch zu veranschaulichen, sollen im zweiten Teil der Arbeit einige um das \u201ek\u00fcnstlerisch hektische\u201c Jahr 1914 entstandene Arbeiten italienischer Futuristen in Betracht gezogen und deren \u00e4sthetische Faktur angesichts der besprochenen Theorien und der bestehenden Schrift-Bild-Relationen verdeutlicht werden. Ziel ist hier zu untersuchen, inwieweit einzelne Bildtexte, deren Sprache auf unterschiedlicher Weise entziffert werden muss, das \u00e4sthetische Ideal der futuristischen Bewegung widerspiegeln. Die Auseinandersetzung mit der Besonderheit der jeweiligen Texte soll erm\u00f6glichen, die Singularit\u00e4t der in direktem Zusammenhang mit dem Schaffensprozess stehenden Varianten, den Spielraum der jeweiligen Techniken und k\u00fcnstlerischen Intentionen und die Radikalit\u00e4t der Problemstellungen bei den Literaten des italienischen Futurismus nachzuvollziehen. Die Auswahl wurde in Anbetracht der Vielzahl k\u00fcnstlerischer Positionen, Intentionen, Arbeitsmethoden, Konzepte bzw. formaler und inhaltlicher Anliegen exemplarisch getroffen. Das 6. abschlie\u00dfende Kapitel fasst thesenartig eine Reihe von weitergehenden \u00dcberlegungen zusammen.\n\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37835212, "asset_id": 12814990, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3744590, "first_name": "Monica", "last_name": "Pintucci", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MonicaPintucci", "display_name": "Monica Pintucci", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MonicaPintucci?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3744590/1346937/2051332/s65_monica.pintucci.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 807, "name": "Philosophy Of Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_Of_Language?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 867, "name": "Perception", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Perception?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8536, "name": "Hybridization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridization?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54659, "name": "Subjectivity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subjectivity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 123693, "name": "Symbols", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Symbols?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 268096, "name": "Totality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Totality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 488736, "name": "Captions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Captions?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 717687, "name": "Picture Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Picture_Languages?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 835858, "name": "Multimediality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multimediality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1719678, "name": "Autor\u00e9f\u00e9rentialit\u00e9", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Autor%C3%A9f%C3%A9rentialit%C3%A9?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1914736, "name": "Visuelle Posie", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visuelle_Posie?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 4804827, "title": "The Fertile \"Third Space\" in Jhumpa Lahiri's Stories", "created_at": "2013-10-17T19:02:19.145-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4804827/The_Fertile_Third_Space_in_Jhumpa_Lahiris_Stories?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_4804827", "summary": "Scholarly debates over immigration and \u201cdiaspora\u201d have shifted in recent years to pluralistic approaches of critics such as Bhabha and Hall who argue that the \u201chybridity\u201d and \u201cin-betweenness\u201d of immigrants\u2019 life might function as a suitable ground for the social and cultural improvement of their life-conditions. Drawing on such ideas, writers of the present article contend that Jhumpa Lahiri presents a double-sided outlook about the \u201cthird space\u201d of diasporic life in her stories, while most critics have considered her attitude toward immigration a negative one. We argue that though Lahiri portrays immigrants\u2019 problems in her stories, a meticulous appraisal of her work reveals the fact that she opposes too much insistence on traditional definitions of home and motherland, and instead pays tribute to the fluidity and flexibility of hybrid identity. She foregrounds the efficiency and fertility of the \u201cthird space\u201d of diasporic life in several cases in her fiction by giving centrality and priority to those characters that are flexible, renounce the restricting customs of the left motherland, venture experiencing the inexperienced, and consequently can match themselves with their changed social position to achieve the best out of it.

Whether engaged in migration or experiencing a static existence in India, Uma (Fasting, Feasting), Bim and Tara (Clear Light of Day) are exposed to cultural difference and this process influences their strategies of identity negotiation. The most important instrument of their cultural change is represented by the world of the mission schools that involves different challenges for each character. The present analysis focuses on the manners in which the Indian women under scrutiny attempt to refashion their cultural norms in accordance with the Western values disseminated by the missionary schools in India. The discussion employs theories of hybridity and culturally specific gender conventions in order to account for the characters' need to modify their inherited gender roles. The present argument advances a novel approach to cultural hybridity, which goes beyond the idea of an identity label customarily applied to migrant identities. Starting from the assumptions that all cultures are inherently hybrid and that the notion of hybridity covers a dynamic process, the discussion demonstrates that the transformations experienced by these characters illustrate the emergence of different patterns of female hybrid identities within the same cultural sphere. Thus, the argument sets out to demonstrate that Anita Desai's Indian women, whether migrant or non-migrant, experience different speeds of cultural transformation, depending on their different positioning towards Hindu and Christian prescriptions. Their metamorphoses illustrate that cultural hybridity is not a necessarily a consequence of migration, but an ongoing cultural process that constantly reshapes cultural patterns.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55005252, "asset_id": 35143395, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3612315, "first_name": "Elena", "last_name": "Stoican", "domain_name": "ase", "page_name": "ElenaStoican", "display_name": "Elena Stoican", "profile_url": "https://ase.academia.edu/ElenaStoican?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3612315/1262554/6455600/s65_elena.stoican.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 38027192, "title": "Macedonian Music in Croatia: The Issues of Traditionality, Politics of Representation and Hybridity", "created_at": "2018-12-22T14:40:12.151-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38027192/Macedonian_Music_in_Croatia_The_Issues_of_Traditionality_Politics_of_Representation_and_Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_38027192", "summary": "Manuscript version of the published paper.\nThe goal of this paper is to offer a sketch of the presence of Macedonian music in Croatia. Currently, it is arguably the most ubiquitous, ethnically marked non-Croatian music, performed not only by visiting Macedonian musicians, but also by domestic participants, some of whom are Macedonians, while other are non-Macedonian aficionados. It appears not only in small-scale contexts of music-making but also in public performance venues, commercial recordings and in the media, and it comprises not only simple borrowings, but also inclusions of Macedonian features into the scope of Croatian music. In the first part of the paper, the author outlines the Macedonian musical contribution to the shared Yugoslav past, which is central to the flourishing of Macedonian music in Croatia today. She mentions a number of Macedonian urban songs, which functioned as pan-Yugoslav, although they were undoubtedly specifically Macedonian at the same time. Then, she discusses 7/8 meter, which was so popular that it even entered into the representative local musics of Croatia. Finally, she notes the borrowing of some Macedonian musical instruments, especially tapan. The second part of the paper is dedicated to the main participants in the contemporary Macedonian music scene in Croatia: performance groups associated with Macedonian cultural organizations and two ethno-pop bands. The author concludes that the key differences in their positions and perceptions fall along the axis of official and unofficial backgrounds, as well as along the axis of traditionality and hybridity, rather than along the line of ethnicity. At the end is a brief disscussion of hybridity, its benefits as well as its shortages to the understanding of (and writing about) contemporary social and cultural realities. Within this paper, the concept of hybridity is useful as an incentive to look more closely into the politics of representation of all of those participating in the play of traditionality.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58048977, "asset_id": 38027192, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 76832535, "first_name": "Naila", "last_name": "Ceriba\u0161i\u0107 / Ceribasic", "domain_name": "ief", "page_name": "NailaCeribasic", "display_name": "Naila Ceriba\u0161i\u0107 / Ceribasic", "profile_url": "https://ief.academia.edu/NailaCeribasic?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/76832535/19082601/21015177/s65_naila.ceriba_i_ceribasic.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50118, "name": "Representation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Representation?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 105232, "name": "Croatia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Croatia?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392930, "name": "Hrvatska", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hrvatska?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1317291, "name": "Macedonian Folk Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Macedonian_Folk_Music?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1590748, "name": "Tradicionalnost", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tradicionalnost?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2504242, "name": "traditionality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/traditionality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3089731, "name": "makedonska glazba", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/makedonska_glazba?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3089732, "name": "predstavljanje", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/predstavljanje?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3089733, "name": "hibridnost", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/hibridnost?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 35766386, "title": "Psychanalyse et hybridit\u00e9.

Rather than see the protest as wholly \u201calien,\u201d as it was conceived of by anti-immigrant forces, or as purely \u201cAmerican,\u201d as an attempt for mere recognition, La Gran Marcha can best be understood as performing a hybrid U.S. citizenship.

Eccentric Perspectives on Art is a multi-authored volume of collected essays that answer the challenge of thinking Art History, and the Arts in a broader sense, from a liminal point of view. Its main goal is thus to discuss the margin from the centre - drawing on its concomitance within study themes and subjects, ontological and epistemological positions, or research methodologies themselves. Marginality, eccentricity, liminality, and superfluity are all part of a dynamic relationship between centre and margin(s) that will be approached and discussed, from the point of view of disciplines as different and as close as art history, philosophy, literature and design, from medieval to contemporary art. \nResulting from recent research developed from the privileged viewpoint offered by the margin, this volume brings together the contributions of young researchers along with the work of career scholars. Likewise, it does not obey a traditional or a rigid diachronic structure, being rather organized in three major parts that organically articulate the different essays. Within each of these parts in which the book is divided, papers are sometimes organized according to their timeframes, providing the reader with an encompassing (though not encyclopedic) overview of the common ground over which the various artistic disciplines build their methodological, theoretical, and thematic centers and margins.

The comparison with In Cold Blood\nand L\u2019Adversaire allows to emphasize the different ways the text functions and the effects regarding the\npresence (or absence) of the first-person narrator within the merely seemingly homogenous genre (the nonfiction\nnovel). The process of the \u201cexpansion of meaning\u201d, a proper characteristic of every great poetic\nwork, is intensified in Gomorrah by means of the construction of a special hybrid form, where\nautobiographical narration and the factuality of data are interwoven to form a single logic, which is capable\nof involving the reader emotionally and to induce an active reflection on the subject.\n                                                               \nTramite un\u2019indagine che si richiama a postulati di narratologia e alle categorie di finzionalit\u00e0/non finzionalit\u00e0, e\nattraverso una serie di raffronti mirati con opere di altri autori (Sciascia, Capote, Carr\u00e8re e Primo Levi), il saggio\nesplora il funzionamento della forma ibrida del testo di Gomorra e le sue caratteristiche \u201cletterarie\u201d, in quanto\nchiavi del successo del libro. Il confronto con In Cold Blood e con L\u2019Adversaire permettono di evidenziare,\nall\u2019interno di un genere (il non-fiction novel) soltanto apparentemente omogeneo, funzioni ed effetti differenti\nlegati alla presenza (o assenza) del narratore in prima persona. Il processo di \u201cespansione di significato\u201d, caratteristica\npropria di qualsiasi grande opera poetica, viene potenziato in Gomorra dalla costruzione di una forma\nibrida particolare, nella quale narrazione-testimonianza e fattualit\u00e0 dei dati si intrecciano in un\u2019unica logica,\ncapace di coinvolgere emotivamente il lettore e di spingerlo alla riflessione.",

However, analyses of anti-transhumanist apocalypticisms are still rare, and those that exist are situated mainly among broader explorations of religious and secular bioconservatism. This article addresses this lack of specificity by drawing analyses of transhumanism and religion into dialogue with explorations of contemporary demonology through a close study of the beliefs of the evangelical conspiracist Thomas Horn and the anti-transhumanist milieu around him. Exploring the milieu's multifaceted demonology of the secular world in light of genealogies of religion and secularity, the article situates Horn's demonology as one attempt to negotiate these genealogies, using what Sean McCloud terms a \u201c\u2018supernatural\u2019 hermeneutics of suspicion\u201d that sees spiritual forces as the structural base of reality.

Biculturalism, bilingualism and the identification with an ethnic background different from that of the dominant culture are some of the factors that make Chicanas feel a frequent sense of otherness. The elements mentioned before blend in the character of Mary in Demetria Martinez\u00b4novel Mother Tongue (1994). These features together with her personal life story make Mary desperately search for something which would give a sense of purpose to her existence, as she puts it \u201cBefore his arrival the chaos of my life had no axis about which to spin. Now I had a center\u201d (5). At first sight the text may be considered a love story between Mary and the Salvadorean refugee Jos\u00e9 Luis Romero. Reading beyond the lines, we may notice that while writing the story, she unconsciously starts a voyage of self discovery which would help her find a meaning to her life.\nThe novel, which is divided into five parts and an epilogue, makes use of different narrative strategies. Among them I can mention multiple narrators: Mary as the protagonist and main narrative voice, Jos\u00e9 Luis Romero /Alegr\u00eda, the Salvadorean refugee, Jos\u00e9 Luis, their son, and her godmother Soledad. Another technique the author employs is different types of texts to structure the plot: Mary\u2019s memories, as the main narrative form, poems, letters, newspaper articles, notices, prayers, bulletins and lists. The text is an act of recollection since Mary, as a middle aged-woman, writes about the events that took place when she was nineteen.\n\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46003358, "asset_id": 25666189, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49331683, "first_name": "M\u00f3nica", "last_name": "Cuello", "domain_name": "unla", "page_name": "M\u00f3nicaCuello", "display_name": "M\u00f3nica Cuello", "profile_url": "https://unla.academia.edu/M%C3%B3nicaCuello?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/49331683/12975633/14337083/s65_m_nica.cuello.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 388, "name": "Latin American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9650, "name": "Cultural Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Identity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 80160, "name": "American and British Minority Ethnic Literatures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_and_British_Minority_Ethnic_Literatures?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 24093127, "title": "Tobias, E.

It fosters classrooms that mix aspects of general music and ensembles; mobile devices and acoustic instruments; or musics from multiple genres, eras, and cultures. The hybrid approach discussed in this chapter situates students\u2019 learning and musical engagement in musical inquiry and projects. This approach is flexible enough to support students\u2019 interests in particular musical foci in a manner that resists linear, sequential, or compartmentalized forms of instruction.

"summary": "In Zeyno'nun O\u011flu, from a perspective that might be considered unique, Halide Edip endeavors to handle such issues like nation-state, nationality, gender, and civilization which she frequently addresses in her other works. In her only work that employs Diyarbak\u0131r as the main setting, a southeastern city of Turkey with a considerable Kurdish population, the writer studies the relationship among the citizens with diverse ethnic origins through a solid plot structure. Written a few years after the foundation of the Turkish Republic, the novel is also historically compelling in the way the writer deals with the issues. This article, founded on the hypothesis that plot structure and characterization techniques may reflect the ideology of a writer, analyzes the novel within the framework of the theories that examine the relationship between\r\nnationalism and gender. It, thus, aims to study the novelist\u2019s discourse vis-\u00e0-vis the official nation-state ideology by questioning the roles she attaches not only to men and women, but also to different ethnicities and social classes in her notion of nation. The article illustrates that a geometrical web of relations is constructed both through the setting and the characterization. This web, which initially forms a symmetry of opposites, evolves into a fusion of opposites as the two Zeynos of the novel unite on a common plane (motherhood). The questioning of the meaning of motherhood on biological, social and ideological levels also helps the crystallization of a symbolical level which originally was inspired by Christian iconography. In conclusion, the interpretation of these levels reveals that the novelist, while reproducing certain facets of official nation-state ideology such as the leadership of military and intellectual classes, constructing Turkism as meta-identity and accentuating the importance of education as national initiative,\r\nin effect, offers an alternative to the dominant ideology by praising hybridity in terms of ethnicity and gender.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54108605, "asset_id": 34191264, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 67737, "first_name": "G\u00fcnil \u00d6zlem", "last_name": "Ayayd\u0131n Cebe", "domain_name": "samsun", "page_name": "GunilOzlem", "display_name": "G\u00fcnil \u00d6zlem Ayayd\u0131n Cebe", "profile_url": "https://samsun.academia.edu/GunilOzlem?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/67737/19011/14777972/s65_g_nil.ayaydin_cebe.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 86483, "name": "20th century Turkish novel", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/20th_century_Turkish_novel?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 655091, "name": "Halide Edip Ad\u0131var", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Halide_Edip_Adivar?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 46624952, "title": "Problematic Hybrid Identity in the Diasporic Writings of Jhumpa Lahiri", "created_at": "2021-04-12T01:11:09.839-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/46624952/Problematic_Hybrid_Identity_in_the_Diasporic_Writings_of_Jhumpa_Lahiri?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_46624952", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 42540414, "first_name": "Joel", "last_name": "Kuortti", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JoelKuortti", "display_name": "Joel Kuortti", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JoelKuortti?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/42540414/14218134/15188461/s65_joel.kuortti.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 148686, "name": "INDIAN DIASPORIC LITERATURE", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/INDIAN_DIASPORIC_LITERATURE?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 162859, "name": "Jhumpa Lahiri", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jhumpa_Lahiri?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 41630629, "title": "The revaluation of hybridity in Tayeb Salih's Season of Migration to the North", "created_at": "2020-01-14T18:54:27.757-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41630629/The_revaluation_of_hybridity_in_Tayeb_Salihs_Season_of_Migration_to_the_North?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_41630629", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61787649, "asset_id": 41630629, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1139999, "first_name": "Apala", "last_name": "Das", "domain_name": "utoronto", "page_name": "ApalaDas", "display_name": "Apala Das", "profile_url": "https://utoronto.academia.edu/ApalaDas?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1139999/400765/81658421/s65_apala.das.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 32009, "name": "Tayeb Salih", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tayeb_Salih?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 61922, "name": "Agency", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agency?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 8252975, "title": "Skilda gravar, skilda v\u00e4rldar \u2013 tidigkristna gravar, kyrkor, stadsg\u00e5rdar och storg\u00e5rdar i Sigtuna och i M\u00e4laromr\u00e5det (Separate burial grounds, worlds apart \u2013 Early Christian graves, churches, town properties and manorial estates in Sigtuna and the Lake M\u00e4laren region) (2014).", "created_at": "2014-09-08T23:16:50.056-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8252975/Skilda_gravar_skilda_v%C3%A4rldar_tidigkristna_gravar_kyrkor_stadsg%C3%A5rdar_och_storg%C3%A5rdar_i_Sigtuna_och_i_M%C3%A4laromr%C3%A5det_Separate_burial_grounds_worlds_apart_Early_Christian_graves_churches_town_properties_and_manorial_estates_in_Sigtuna_and_the_Lake_M%C3%A4laren_region_2014_?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_8252975", "summary": "Sten Tesch -

It also considered the role of landscape, home and homeland in the conception of identity. Using Segun Afolabi\u2019s collection of short stories, A Life Elsewhere, the study examined the role of literature in the defamilization of the experiences of exiles and returnees. It expressed some factors that might have cushioned or resolved the psychological effects of being elsewhere. The study explicated the experiences of Nigeria in the west, as it  considered the adaptability of Nigerians in the cosmopolitan landscapes of the world.        \nHybridity was used as the theoretical framework. The ethnographic study carried out a qualitative study design. Key Informant Interview Technique was employed to garner data. Six respondents were purposively selected; three respondents were exiles while the others were returnees. The study also involved the analysis of the selected works of Segun Afolabi\u2019s A Life Elsewhere, a collection of 17 short stories. 6 stories were selected 17 were selected due to its clear depiction of African migrant life. The stories were used to x-ray the responses of exiles and returnees in the interview conducted by the researcher. \nThe voluntary exiles recognised their roots as the sending country but realised that the landscape has changed. They are faced with the uncertainties of adapting in a place they used to call home. These exiles found strategies to cope with being away from home, they became part of the Nigeria-in-Diaspora community. They engaged in Nigerian parties, churches, gained access to Nigerian delicacies, music and literature as part of expressing nostalgia as well as cushioning the same. Voluntary exiles had \u2018emotional\u2019 and financial investments in the sending country as they regularly communicated with family members in the homeland. The returnees narrowed the idea home to their villages or their place of birth but one returnee totally detached herself from her sending country as she conceived herself as a citizen of the world. The study revealed that return to the sending was dependent on the emotional attachment, the support from social groups such as family and friends in the sending country who would help with reintegration as well as the respondent\u2019s ability to adapt to peculiar work cultures in the sending country. A returnee noted that she would not return because of the unfavourable cultural and economic nuances of the sending country. \nFor the respondents, Literature did not provide a full reflection of life in exile but reflected on the relevant psychological and economic challenges of people living elsewhere. Literature formed part of the narratives of existence in form of socio-political discourse, film and books and expressed a peculiar cosmopolitanism that contributed to the identity of the members of the sending country. \n\nKeywords: Exile, Nostalgia, Homeland, Hybridity, Displacement, Cosmopolitanism \n Word Count : 456 \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67599406, "asset_id": 49213228,

the most influential writers of post-colonial period who bear a torch to devastation and\nmultifaceted and far-reaching results of colonial time by their critical approach. To turn the tables, armed struggle\nwas the first step of resistance for independence in the process of decolonization. But later on, intellectual exertion\nto construct a national identity was debated aloud to take place the violent opposition because colonizers had not\nonly invaded lands but also they interposed identity, culture and language of colonized people into East-West axis\n(traditional-modern, barbaric-civilized, underdeveloped-developed) which would be never the same as it had been\nbefore colonialism. In this sense, this study aspires to set forth how Season of Migration to the North responds to\ncolonial discourses of Heart of Darkness which springs out of the rooted perspective against the East. At first,\nSalih makes quiet and passive colonized native characters of Conrad to be heard and then shows how they survive\nwhile struggling with doubled identity interposed between East-West and the periods before and after colonization.\nSalih humanizes who Conrad dehumanizes in Heart of Darkness. However, Joseph Conrad denies offering a\nsolution to the problems of natives like hybridity; Salih comes through a final point for the colonized people. By\ncompare and contrast, the study will try to show how Conrad\u2019s criticism is superficial, insufficient and paradoxical\nin the means of not providing a remedy for identity problem unlike Tayeb Salih who resolves rooted troubles of\ncolonialism through \u201cmental miscegenation\u201d as Benedict Anderson put forward many years after Salih\u2019s death.\nKey Words: Colonialism, Post-colonialism, West-East, Identity Crisis, Hybridity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54057006, "asset_id": 34129602, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 20053652, "first_name": "Halil Ibrahim", "last_name": "Arpa", "domain_name": "karatekin", "page_name": "HibrahimArpa", "display_name": "Halil Ibrahim  Arpa", "profile_url": "https://karatekin.academia.edu/HibrahimArpa?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/20053652/19682956/45043692/s65_halil_ibrahim.arpa.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 239877, "name": "East West relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_West_relations?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 44794138, "title": "The Quest for Identity: Hybridity in Fadia Faqir's The Cry of the Dove", "created_at": "2020-12-29T05:22:26.396-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44794138/The_Quest_for_Identity_Hybridity_in_Fadia_Faqirs_The_Cry_of_the_Dove?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_44794138", "summary": "Recently, Arabic Literary novels have become highly topical to researches due to their prone reflection of\ntraditional norms and customs that control the patterns of Arab societies.

A comparative electronic survey of some 900 journals reveals that when scholars referred to these individuals collectively during the last 200 years they employed some twenty different signifiers. The question I address is simple yet potentially foundational: which collective signifier can define and capture most productively, inclusively and comprehensively the socio-political and cultural experiences of those who comprised the Arab Middle East's ten indigenous Jewish minority communities prior to their dispersal (in the post-1949 armistice period)? I propose that the signifier \u2018Arabized-Jews\u2019 exhibits explanatory properties that outweigh those of its alternatives both quantitatively and qualitatively. As such, \u2018Arabized-Jews\u2019 denotes Jews who were culturally and/or linguistically Arab yet who did not self-define primarily as Arab, let alone in political terms. In exploring the dialectic interface between ethno-politics, terminological formations and the production of meaning, this article suggests that it makes sense for contemporary scholars to employ \u2018Arabized-Jews\u2019 to refer collectively to Jews across the modern Arab Middle East.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37037005, "asset_id": 9648836, "asset_type": "Work",

globalization, particularly on developing countries, is often loosely viewed as a process of Westernization. The opening of markets combined with a flow of Westernized idea of life is skeptically viewed as Euro-American hegemonic approach to the rest of the world. The conventional response to counter this process through the preservation of cultural tradition and a contested identity has often led to insistence on \u201cmoral purity\u201d and preservation of \u201cindigenous values.\u201d However, in the face of inevitable acceptance of a global culture in an era of unlimited flow of information and access to knowledge, the viable response seems to be an acceptance of cultural hybridization. This article tries to capture this trans-cultural dilemma of India among the upper middle class in relation to an attire that is increasingly making its way as a norm\u2014wearing \u201cshorts.\u201d The wearing of shorts by young girls in a traditional setup in India was generally viewed as an embodiment of western modernity and often frowned upon as \u201cvulgar\u201d by the society. Interestingly, the attitude towards this piece of clothing is gradually moving toward deeming it as a mark of \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201crespect\u201d to women in the elite circles. This notion is percolating down through the average middle class and shorts have transformed from \u201cvulgar\u201d to \u201cprogressive.\u201d The article attempts to explore the reasons for this transformation of worldview among the middle class families of India and the resultant ambivalence that exists in being compelled to choose shorts as a piece of modernity. Using cultural hybridization as a framework, through a series of interviews among young Indian girls and the people related to them in a small town in India, this article attempts to comprehend the attitude toward the wearing of shorts. It proposes to examine the impact of globalization beyond the conventional perceptions of westernization and opens up newer perspectives of understanding the impact of global culture.

Despite longstanding scholarly interest in Roman \u201cAegyptiaca,\u201d relatively little research has yet attempted to contextualize Egyptian or Egyptian-style material culture from Roman domestic settings. This book draws on case studies from Flavian Pompeii to investigate the close association between representations of Egypt and a particular type of Roman household space: domestic gardens. In contrast to older interpretations connecting Roman Aegyptiaca to Isis cult or the problematic concept of \u201cEgyptomania,\u201d a contextual analysis of Pompeian garden assemblages destabilizes both of these readings and opens up additional possibilities for meaning. Simultaneously faraway and familiar, the garden\u2019s imagined landscapes transform domestic space into a microcosm of oikoumene and encourage their occupants to engage in open-ended ways with changing constructions of imperial, local, and cultural identities. \n\nWithin Pompeian gardens, visual evocations of Egyptian landscapes appear in multiple media: both two-dimensional (e.g., paintings and mosaics that depict the Nile) and three-dimensional (e.g., water features and garden statuary). These objects and images interact with their settings to construct complex entanglements of \u201cforeign\u201d and \u201cfamiliar,\u201d \u201cself\u201d and \u201cother.\u201d Representations of Egyptian landscapes in Pompeian gardens enabled individuals to articulate and perform social identities as cosmopolitan, sophisticated citizens of empire. Yet at the same time, household material culture also exerted an agency of its own: domesticizing, familiarizing, and \u201cRomanizing\u201d once-foreign images and objects. That which was once alien and potentially dangerous was now part of the domus itself, increasingly incorporated into cultural constructions of Romanitas. Through participatory multimedia assemblages evoking landscapes simultaneously local and international, the houses examined in this book made the breadth of oikoumene compatible with the familiarity of home.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58990129, "asset_id": 23844801, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 281995, "first_name": "Caitl\u00edn E.", "last_name": "Barrett", "domain_name": "cornell", "page_name": "Caitl\u00ednEBarrett", "display_name": "Caitl\u00edn E.

It engages with the structural, contextual, and perceptual aspects of music by mixing perspectives from music studies with postcolonial studies, situated cognition, and genre studies. Hybridity is treated as a common communication tool and, as such, goes beyond the expected repertories of polystylism and musical collage from the 1960s and 1970s. In this way, this study approaches diverse works ranging from seventeenth- to twenty-first-century Western music, embracing concert and popular traditions within the same framework. In this dissertation, I engage first with perspectives on hybridity from the field of postcolonial studies, and trace a brief summary of their different general stances before moving to iterations of hybridity in a wide musical repertory. Next, I investigate the literature on the notions of style and genre, and define them as the main articulations of musical hybridity, mediating between individual, textual, and contextual perspectives in a dynamic and fluid way. The proposed analytical framework treats moments of hybridity in music\u2014chimeric environments\u2014as formed by four distinct mixture strategies: clash, coexistence, distortion, and trajectory. These mixture strategies are perceptible processes, given the familiarity with a shared knowledge within a musical community; they can be interpreted\u2014even if with different characteristics, purposes, and realizations\u2014in J. S. Bach, Alfred Schnittke, Thomas Ad\u00e8s, David Bowie, and Daft Punk, for instance. Mixture strategies are, then, lenses for interpretation of hybridity in music, which I discuss in detail, with definition and exemplification of their characteristics, changing values, and reception, affording comparisons between different ways of combining musical identities in pluralist music.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60499574, "asset_id": 37734801, "asset_type": "Work",

the\n1970s. Some would date its rise in the Western academy from the\npublication of Edward Said's influential critique of Western constructions\nof the Orient in his 1978 book, Orientalism. The growing currency within\nthe academy of the term \"postcolonial\" (sometimes hyphenated) was\nconsolidated by the appearance in 1989 of The Empire Writes Back:\nTheory and Practice in Post-Colonial Literatures by Bill Ashcroft, Gareth\nGriffiths, and Helen Tiffin. Since then, the use of cognate terms \"Commonwealth\" and\n\"Third World\" that were used to describe the literature of Europe's former colonies has\nbecome rarer. Although there is considerable debate over the precise parameters of the\nfield and the definition of the term \"postcolonial,\" in a very general sense, it is the study\nof the interactions between European nations and the societies they colonized in the\nmodern period. The European empire is said to have held sway over more than 85% of\nthe rest of the globe by the time of the First World War, having consolidated its control\nover several centuries. The sheer extent and duration of the European empire and its\ndisintegration after the Second World War have led to widespread interest in postcolonial\nliterature and criticism in our own times.",

Epigraph: \"with your black and white eyes upon me, I feel I am a new citizen of the country of your vision\" (Invisible Man). A tendency to see Ellison's classic as representative of \"the black experience\" has obscured the novel's multiracial message, structure, and origins. Most of the novel takes place within interracial contact zones--on racial frontiers. Much of Invisible Man is in fact about the search for a multiracial community.  This revisionist reading places Ellison within the literature of borderlands. Close readings follow the themes of being a \"new citizen\" of a multiracial audience; \"One-eyed brothers\"; \"A straight white line,\" \"A bath of whiteness,\" and \"biracial culture heroes.\"",

There is a particular focus on theories which have arisen through colonial discourse and previous evaluation of colonialism. The argument for this discussion employs Homi K. Bhabha\u2019s theory of the third space of enunciation. Bhabha (2004) utilises ideas on hybridity in colonialism, in order to develop a theory that refers to the generation of a non-representational space, wherein the utterance of culture occurs.\n\n This theory engages with displaced, postcolonial artists Athi-Patra Ruga and Rotimi Fani-Kayode whose works act to demonstrate and perhaps actively validate Bhabha\u2019s third space in practice. It explores how both artists refer themselves to the formulation of subjective, hybrid worlds where they may further address and challenge colonial histories and narratives from a new and entirely distinct dimension. However, for the task it is alone to condense yet explain in enough depth fragments of colonialism, hybridity and the third space, the discussion is restricted by official regulations and experiences limitations in being unable to thoroughly present the full complexity of the worlds articulated by the artists. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66246269, "asset_id": 43533795, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 99866776, "first_name": "Sherie", "last_name": "Sitauze", "domain_name": "goldsmiths", "page_name": "SherieSitauze", "display_name": "Sherie Sitauze", "profile_url": "https://goldsmiths.academia.edu/SherieSitauze?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/99866776/38414026/32149138/s65_sherie.sitauze.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13050, "name": "African Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Diaspora?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13995, "name": "Postcolonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 23791, "name": "Third Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Third_Space?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 26558, "name": "Visual Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Arts?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 30045, "name": "Homi Bhabha (Cultural Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homi_Bhabha_Cultural_Theory_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 43349, "name": "Fine Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fine_Arts?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 53034, "name": "Cultural hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 58864, "name": "Homi K.

While immigrants to Canada from the Middle East faced discrimination, white audiences could not get enough of stereotypical portrayals of danse du ventre. Hollywood further popularized the Orientalist image of the belly dancer, and beginning in the 1950s, star Middle Eastern dancers like Samia Gamal and Nejla Ate\u015f were making appearances on Toronto stages. By the 1960s, American, Middle Eastern, and Canadian dancers were performing belly dance in Toronto\u2019s hotel nightclubs and restaurants. During belly dance\u2019s peak popularity in the 1970s and 1980s, multiple venues were running two belly dance shows a night, six days a week, and belly dance classes were so popular they were often waitlisted. Why and how did this Middle Eastern dance form become so popular between 1950 and 1990 in the city of Toronto?\n Various archival sources and twelve oral history interviews with professional dancers and teachers indicate that belly dance\u2019s popularization in Toronto was partially a result of its widespread stereotypical presentation in North America as something exotic, ancient, and sexual. This contributed to a growing demand for belly dance shows amongst white Canadians, but increasing immigration from the Middle East was an even more essential element in the growth of Middle Eastern entertainment in the city. White and Middle Eastern dancers and teachers who worked in Toronto hybridized belly dance performances as they circulated transnationally, with some working and performing internationally while also developing personal and professional relationships which bridged ethnic and cultural divides. Dancers and instructors alternately embraced and resisted Orientalist stereotype in their work as they navigated a social and political context in Canada which favoured whiteness. Many also laboured to increase belly dance\u2019s respectability by trying to distance performances from overt sexuality, or by aligning them with regional pride, spirituality, fitness, or feminism. Belly dancers, instructors, and choreographers participated in uneven processes of exchange and hybridization which characterized belly dance\u2019s popularization in Toronto.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53089161, "asset_id": 32963903, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3543117, "first_name": "Anne", "last_name": "Vermeyden", "domain_name": "uoguelph", "page_name": "AnneVermeyden", "display_name": "Anne  Vermeyden", "profile_url": "https://uoguelph.academia.edu/AnneVermeyden?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3543117/1220380/17625443/s65_anne.vermeyden.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1556, "name": "Dance Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dance_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2412, "name": "Canadian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canadian_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13006, "name": "Immigration History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration_History?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 16234, "name": "Dance History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dance_History?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 51334, "name": "Orientalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Orientalism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 128635, "name": "Belly dance in a social-cultural context", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belly_dance_in_a_social-cultural_context?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 253606, "name": "Middle Eastern Dances", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_Eastern_Dances?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 992467, "name": "Oriental Dancers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oriental_Dancers?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 44975964, "title": "Becoming a chimaera and rethinking hybridity: An auto-ethnographic journey", "created_at": "2021-01-25T11:39:45.361-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44975964/Becoming_a_chimaera_and_rethinking_hybridity_An_auto_ethnographic_journey?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_44975964", "summary": "In Greek mythology the Chimaera was a fearful fire-breathing hybrid creature of Lycia in Asia Minor, one of the offspring of monsters Typhon and Echidna.

The term \u2018chimera\u2019 has come to describe anything composed of different parts, anything that is perceived as wildly imaginative, implausible, or unattainable. In medicine and genetics this term indicates an organism containing a mixture of genetically different tissues. How does it feel to incorporate such dreadful hybridity?

In this novel, Soueif emphasises post-colonial reconsiderations and accordingly demonstrates her conscious attempt with extensive references to the colonial and imperial history of Egypt. The present study in particular looks at desire and hybridity in the novel with Robert J. C. Young's Colonial Desire: Hybridity in Theory, Culture and Race and offers an interpretation of the post-colonial Other's interpellation by the culture of the coloniser and of desire which is problematized by reading about desire in imperial culture. In investigating these points, it is stated that the problematic and hegemonic centrality of English Literature for the Arab female characters makes post-colonial texts haunted and post-colonial discussions around adultery, alterity and sexual imperialism shape the content of the novel. By describing and considering these issues, this study attempts to offer a post-colonial reading of the novel.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63484463, "asset_id": 43214821, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 58534634, "first_name": "AYSE", "last_name": "CIRCIR", "domain_name": "erzurum", "page_name": "AYSECIRCIR", "display_name": "AYSE CIRCIR", "profile_url": "https://erzurum.academia.edu/AYSECIRCIR?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/58534634/15322170/35558799/s65_ayse.circir.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 885, "name": "English Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Literature?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 32005, "name": "Edward Said", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Edward_Said?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 51334, "name": "Orientalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Orientalism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 58862, "name": "Robert J.

Social-scientific discourses have an impact on the self-perception of tradition, authenticity and identity in the broader society. In the following sections, I shall trace various scholarly discourses on Filipino tradition, national identity, and popular Christianity. \r\nHence religion functions either as obstacle to or source of national identity. From the post-Second World War years until today, the intellectual attitude towards Christianity varied considerably: outright refusal of the oppressor\u2019s religion by left-wing nationalists, reappraisal of a revolutionary \u00bbPassion Catholicism\u00ab by the \u00bbhistory from below\u00ab discourse, attempts of reconstructing pre-Christian animism, Austronesian cosmology and/or mystic-messianic nationalism as the true religion of \u00bbthe\u00ab Filipino people, or post-nationalist appreciation of religious \u00bbcreolization\u00ab and \u00bbhybridity\u00ab. Such discourses are inseparable from the political development after independence and the postcolonial struggle over intellectual self-determination.\r\nThis chapter examines various attempts of Filipino intellectuals to contribute to the collective identity of their nation. As will be shown below, over a long period of time this ambition could be achieved only by selecting and defining certain essentials that make the desired collective \u00bbgood to think\u00ab. Thus, the scholarly endeavour is aimed at compensating the loss of a supposed cultural authenticity of the past, destroyed by colonialism. In their neo-Marxian struggle for a classless society of \u00bbthe people\u00ab, in their post-Rousseauistic attempts of re-constructing an \u00bbimagined community\u00ab, or in their recent esteem of cultural difference and \u00bbhybridity\u00ab, historians and socio-cultural anthropologists unavoidably take positions in the political arena.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33321555, "asset_id": 6562138, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2849590, "first_name": "Peter J.", "last_name": "Br\u00e4unlein", "domain_name": "uni-goettingen", "page_name": "PeterJBr\u00e4unlein", "display_name": "Peter J.

"summary": "Based on postcolonial concepts borrowed from Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak, and J\u00fcrgen Habermas, this paper studies the appropriation of French language by Algerian authors as a means of representation and resistance to the discourse of the colonizer, and in the case of women authors, to the patriarchal norms of Algerian society.  Kateb Yacine uses French to resist French hegemony through subverting its structures by mixing it with the Algerian language and culture.  His Nedjma reveals two types of narrative discourse: written and oral language, on the one hand, and the use of the Arabo-Berber vernacular, on the other. Yacine also writes against the post-colonial Algerian condition with the attribution of a dominant position to classical Arabic at the expense of Algerian Arabic and Tamazight. By clearing a space for the subaltern voice, women authors writing in French differ from male authors like Yacine.  These women use French language not only to answer back to the colonial discourse but also the discourse held by men vis-a-vis women and their oppressive inferior condition. In Fantasia: An Algerian Cavalcade, Assia Djebar uses oral testimonies and archival information as background for her narrative in order to enrich the reader\u2019s comprehension of the cultural memory of Algeria, but she also fills the socio-cultural and intellectual void that often results from the patriarchal norms of the Algerian society.  In The Forbidden Woman, Malika Mokeddem is similar to Djebar in her use of French not only to subvert the language of the colonizer but, especially, to reconfigure the status of Algerian women.  She reclaims the use of French to resist the Algerian structures of patriarchy. What is common to these three authors and others is their focus on the linguistic hybridity of Algeria, the importance of which must be recognized as an asset to postcolonial Algeria, rather than viewed as a means of dividing the country for the welfare of the ruling few.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34434779, "asset_id": 7962576, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2034774, "first_name": "M Kamel", "last_name": "Igoudjil", "domain_name": "american", "page_name": "MKamelIgoudjil", "display_name": "M Kamel Igoudjil", "profile_url": "https://american.academia.edu/MKamelIgoudjil?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2034774/4568306/94657050/s65_m_kamel.igoudjil.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12760, "name": "Postcolonial Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Feminism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 79356, "name": "Algerian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Algerian_Literature?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 96098, "name": "Resistance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Resistance?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 161576, "name": "Assia Djebar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Assia_Djebar?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 630038, "name": "Linguistic Hybridisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Hybridisation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 684663, "name": "Malika Mokeddem", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malika_Mokeddem?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 815491, "name": "Kateb Yacine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kateb_Yacine?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 843140, "name": "Language and Inter/trans-cultural Communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Inter_trans-cultural_Communication?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 34076279, "title": "GUY BEN-ARY: NERVOPLASTICA.

"summary": "This study critically investigates the prospects of emerging hybridity in Security Sector Reform and Governance (SSR/G). Evolved through peacebuilding and state building paradigms in the post-Cold War era, the stated aim of SSR/G is to promote good governance in security sectors of transition, post-authoritarian, and conflict-affected states, while ensuring state\u201fs successful monopoly on the legitimate use of force. Conflict-affected states are of particular importance since they are incapable of exercising monopoly due to dominance of non-state armed groups, such as terrorists, separatist groups, and private military and security companies. Hybridity projects a tailored SSR/G process that will be built upon a set of principles, such as local/national ownership, inclusion, negotiation, process-dependency, and conflict-prevention. It suggests combining top-down and bottom-up approaches, converging state and non-state domains, and accepting the prevalence of ongoing state formation process in conflict-affected states. Coined by Michel Foucault through 1970s, governmentality refers to controlling people\u201fs behaviors by using political rationalities, governmental techniques and technologies, notably the security mechanisms. This study argues that hybridity is an emerging mode of neoliberal governmentality in SSR theory and practice as well as for liberal peace and state building efforts, which aims to re-produce itself to ensure continuity of security-related interventions. The study begins with a discussion of SSR/G governmentality and post-liberal hybridity. Afterwards, drawing upon the lenses of neoliberal governmentality, it critically questions the effects of hybridity on SSR/G in terms of its transformative dynamics of sovereignty-security nexus, inclusion of non-state, oligopoly on the use of force, and legitimacy-legality relationship.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61644526, "asset_id": 41472350, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5088212, "first_name": "Ahmet", "last_name": "Barbak", "domain_name": "ikc", "page_name": "AhmetBarbak", "display_name": "Ahmet Barbak", "profile_url": "https://ikc.academia.edu/AhmetBarbak?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5088212/2223368/17998778/s65_ahmet.barbak.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 366590, "name": "Security Sector Reform/Security Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_Sector_Reform_Security_Governance?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 20352378, "title": "The \"Third Space\" and the Questions of Identity in Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea", "created_at": "2016-01-18T06:18:40.990-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/20352378/The_Third_Space_and_the_Questions_of_Identity_in_Jean_Rhys_Wide_Sargasso_Sea?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_20352378", "summary": "In this paper, I claim that the \u201cthird space\u201d extends beyond Western hegemonic discourse on identity and self, demonstrating that identity is not a singular and a stable subject but a multiple and fluid one. This article demonstrates that the \u201cthird space\u201d, while opening the avenues for pluralities and negotiations, unsettles and problematizes the issues of identity, belonging, and home in Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea. Discussions on why Antoinette\u2019s position as a Creole in Jamaica problematizes her status and identity, and what barriers negate herself and her sense of belonging are central to this research. I further investigate the roles of Western hegemonic presence in Antoinette\u2019s subjectivity, and her sense of liberation and autonomy. Antoinette\u2019s position in a liminal space not only jeopardizes her identity, her longing for home and belonging, but also creates a hybrid identity that emerges in a moment of historical transformation in Jamaican history. Hybridity interrogates and deconstructs the Western hegemonic assumption of stable subjectivity and meaning. Destabilizing the notion of the Self and the Other as envisioned by Western mainstream narratives, hybridity proposes that the Self is constructed by multiple ideologies and multiple discourses. Antoinette\u2019s occupation of a hybrid position in Wide Sargasso Sea dismantles the stable binaries of white/black, colonizer/colonized category of Western discourse and questions identity formation based on the West as the \u2018Self\u2019 and the non-West as the \u2018Other\u2019 as in Edward Said\u2019s contention in Orientalism.\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 41306714, "asset_id":

relationship between interactive and narrative elements of hybrid digital games has been an important issue. Are digital games texts, stories, simulations or games? What are the crucial traits of their ludicity or hybridity? This book wants to contribute to these debates by designing a model making it possible to analyse the hybrid nature of interactive-narrative digital games in a differentiated manner. Therefore narratives like Joseph Campbell\u2019s \u2018Hero\u2019s Journey\u2019 are used to bridge the gap between the interactive and performative elements of digital games on the one hand and the narrative ones on the other hand. The monomyth (within the meaning of Campbell) provides a very wide range of mythological themes and contents as well as mythical functions allowing the designers to influence the player\u2019s actions. Finally, Nintendo\u2019s The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998) functions as a typical example demonstrating the mechanics of the continuum model by using a little explored digital game.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57084703, "asset_id": 37134163, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51560434, "first_name": "Kai", "last_name": "Matuszkiewicz", "domain_name": "uni-marburg", "page_name": "KaiMatuszkiewicz", "display_name": "Kai Matuszkiewicz", "profile_url": "https://uni-marburg.academia.edu/KaiMatuszkiewicz?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51560434/14718996/24604184/s65_kai.matuszkiewicz.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5199, "name": "Video Games", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Video_Games?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5942, "name": "Monomyth/Hero's Journey", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Monomyth_Heros_Journey?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5946, "name": "Joseph Campbell", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Joseph_Campbell?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15076, "name": "Digital Games", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Games?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 48173, "name": "Narrativity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrativity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 50701, "name": "Computer Games", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Games?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 101071, "name": "Interactivity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interactivity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 743308, "name": "The Legend of Zelda", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Legend_of_Zelda?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 947191, "name": "Christopher Vogler", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christopher_Vogler?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 6710620, "title": "Hibridez, raza y la marimba esmeralde\u00f1a: repensando las fusiones musicales en el pac\u00eefico negro ecuatoriano", "created_at": "2014-04-09T18:47:50.338-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6710620/Hibridez_raza_y_la_marimba_esmeralde%C3%B1a_repensando_las_fusiones_musicales_en_el_pac%C3%AEfico_negro_ecuatoriano?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_6710620", "summary": "Desde los a\u00f1os noventa, con la consolidaci\u00f3n de un\r\nmovimiento social afroecuatoriano que ha reclamado sus\r\nderechos pol\u00edticos y culturales, la marimba surgi\u00f3 como\r\nun potente s\u00edmbolo de la identidad afroecuatoriana.\r\nEste ensayo hace una evaluaci\u00f3n cr\u00edtica de los usos de la\r\nmarimba tanto en la m\u00fasica folcl\u00f3rica como en fusiones\r\npopulares h\u00edbridas, se\u00f1alando su papel en el fomento\r\nde la autodeterminaci\u00f3n negra y de su cultura popular\r\nen el pa\u00eds, pero tambi\u00e9n llamando la atenci\u00f3n sobre la\r\ncapacidad de esta narrativa encomi\u00e1stica de enmascarar\r\nlas continuas discrepancias de poder que acechan tras la\r\npromoci\u00f3n de un folclor hibridizado y de una identidad\r\nnacional multicultural.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33432253, "asset_id": 6710620, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5956109, "first_name": "Jonathan", "last_name": "Ritter", "domain_name": "ucriverside", "page_name": "JonathanRitter", "display_name": "Jonathan Ritter", "profile_url": "https://ucriverside.academia.edu/JonathanRitter?f_ri=4138", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 671, "name": "Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 787, "name": "Folklore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Folklore?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17439, "name": "Ecuador", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecuador?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 669125, "name": "Marimba", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marimba?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 43653808, "title": "Narrative Fiction and Other Media: An Introduction", "created_at": "2020-07-18T04:26:18.254-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43653808/Narrative_Fiction_and_Other_Media_An_Introduction?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_43653808", "summary": "Introduction to the special issue of Lublin Studies in Modern Languages and Literature titled Formal Intersections between Narrative Fiction and Other Media.

This process enabled a mutual influence between the traditional indigenous concepts and modern ones, as well as the adoption of the \u201cChinese origins of Western learning\u201d (Xixue Zhongyuan) formula as a paradigm for cross-cultural understanding. Taking the works of contemporary Jungian analysts Shen Heyong and Gao Lan as primary sources, it will be argued that in post-socialist China a similar trend can be observed in relation to the recovering of the Classic of Changes in connection to the spread of analytical psychology. This resulted in a dialogic hybridisation of Western and Chinese terms, which will finally be shown in relation to Jung\u2019s theory of \u2018synchronicity\u2019 and the traditional indigenous notion of \u2018harmonious unity of man with Heaven\u2019 (tian ren heyi).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66689809, "asset_id": 47747361, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 96303425, "first_name": "Matteo", "last_name": "Sgorbati", "domain_name": "unipg", "page_name": "MatteoSgorbati", "display_name": "Matteo Sgorbati", "profile_url": "https://unipg.academia.edu/MatteoSgorbati?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/96303425/21241267/42571968/s65_matteo.sgorbati.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1021, "name": "Comparative Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Philosophy?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3426, "name": "History Of Psychoanalysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_Of_Psychoanalysis?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5472, "name": "Jungian psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jungian_psychology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5515, "name": "Cross-Cultural Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cross-Cultural_Psychology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 24550, "name": "Contemporary China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_China?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 61255, "name": "Indigenous Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Psychology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 178905, "name": "Synchronicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Synchronicity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 197495, "name": "Yijing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yijing?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1005546, "name": "Comparative Philosophy and Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Philosophy_and_Religion?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 12932058, "title": "Hybridity and Multi-Culturalism in Zadie Smith's White Teeth", "created_at": "2015-06-11T12:37:39.024-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12932058/Hybridity_and_Multi_Culturalism_in_Zadie_Smiths_White_Teeth?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_12932058", "summary": "This paper aims at examining the society presented in the novel White Teeth by Zadie Smith with the help of given concepts of hybridity and multiculturalism.

I will then use these insights to show how specifically these tropes were re-appropriated or mixed to create a truly local tradition.

As a result, many of those who work in the arts and cultures of the Mediterranean, Near East, and Asia have found themselves drawn closer together, but without a common vocabulary or debate with which to engage.\n\nThe organizing goal of this volume is to highlight these theoretical considerations and provide a forum where art historians of the ancient and medieval worlds can explore these problems of cross-cultural interaction with greater rigor. It does not intend to provide a comprehensive theoretical overview or art historical survey of Eurasian artistic interchange, nor an overarching theory. Rather, it aims to contribute critical perspectives drawn from premodern visual cultures to the wider theoretical conversation. The papers contained herein critically evaluate some of the most important problems encountered in the material: the cross-continental movement and selective appropriation of objects and motifs through trade; the impact of new ways of seeing, being seen, and acting introduced by these objects; the role of art and ritual in negotiations of power among empires; and representations and self-portrayals of ethnicity and gender within and beyond dominant visual cultures.\n\nTo order: http://www.asia.si.edu/visitor/arsorientalisVolumeOrder.htm", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

objetivo desta tese foi investigar a m\u00fasica improvisada, a m\u00fasica de c\u00e2mara de Nivaldo Ornelas e sua interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o. Como sua obra transita no ambiente da m\u00fasica popular e no da m\u00fasica erudita, fez-se uma revis\u00e3o bibliogr\u00e1fica desta rela\u00e7\u00e3o dicot\u00f4mica. A dificuldade encontrada para a defini\u00e7\u00e3o destes termos se deve \u00e0 sua abrang\u00eancia e contradi\u00e7\u00f5es decorridas em seu percurso hist\u00f3rico. Foi feita uma an\u00e1lise musical e uma an\u00e1lise comparativa de seis interpreta\u00e7\u00f5es do Noturno para flauta e piano, sua primeira pe\u00e7a erudita, por seis duos de diferentes escolas interpretativas. A partir de textos de fil\u00f3sofos e music\u00f3logos como Sloboda (2007), Bowen (2010) Abdo (2000) e Cook (2006), confirmou-se a possibilidade de m\u00faltiplas interpreta\u00e7\u00f5es v\u00e1lidas e coerentes. Em seguida procedemos ao levantamento de todos os improvisos de Nivaldo em sua discografia autoral. Ap\u00f3s a transcri\u00e7\u00e3o de trinta deles, foram analisados tr\u00eas solos que representam fases distintas. Com o corpus dos improvisos estruturado, foram elencadas caracter\u00edsticas da improvisa\u00e7\u00e3o de Ornelas, nos permitindo buscar semelhan\u00e7as e diferen\u00e7as com sua obra de c\u00e2mara. Tendo como referencial te\u00f3rico Benson (2003), Nettl (1974, 1998), Bailey (1992), Berliner (1994) e Berkowitz (2010), foi estudado o conceito de improvisa\u00e7\u00e3o e de sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o com a composi\u00e7\u00e3o. Agruparam-se ent\u00e3o em quadros explicativos, conceitos e t\u00e9cnicas de improvisa\u00e7\u00e3o, sempre exemplificadas com excertos de solos de Ornelas. Ao final da tese, para aferir o grau de consci\u00eancia que pode ocorrer durante uma improvisa\u00e7\u00e3o, prop\u00f4s-se um experimento com tr\u00eas solistas, tocando sobre uma progress\u00e3o harm\u00f4nica desconhecida por eles, extra\u00edda de uma m\u00fasica de Nivaldo. Ap\u00f3s a transcri\u00e7\u00e3o e an\u00e1lise mel\u00f3dica dos solos, as conclus\u00f5es apontam que, de alguma forma, a consci\u00eancia est\u00e1 presente em todos os takes. Quanto \u00e0 quest\u00e3o da interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o, o estudo constatou a plurissemanticidade da obra. Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao bin\u00f4mio improvisa\u00e7\u00e3o/composi\u00e7\u00e3o, observou-se a exist\u00eancia de mais pontos de aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o do que de diferenciamento nestas atividades. Ao final do estudo, a pesquisa evidenciou o car\u00e1ter hibrido da composi\u00e7\u00e3o de Ornelas, rico no entrela\u00e7amento de elementos da m\u00fasica popular e erudita.\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\n\nThis doctoral dissertation examines Nivaldo Ornelas\u2019s improvised music, chamber music, and their interpretation. Because Ornelas\u2019s work occupies the realms of both popular and classical music, the literature on these terms, which are often construed as dichotomous, is reviewed. Historically, it has been challenging to define what exactly constitutes \u201cpopular\u201d and \u201cclassical\u201d music, as these have been understood in contradictory ways over time. Six interpretations of Ornelas\u2019s first classical piece, Noturno para flauta e piano (Nocturne for flute and piano), as performed by six duos from different interpretive schools, were submitted to musical and comparative analyses. Grounded in texts by such philosophers and musicologists as Sloboda (2007), Bowen (2010), Abdo (2000), and Cook (2006), it is argued that this piece is open to multiple valid and coherent interpretations. All of Ornelas\u2019s improvisations from his own releases were identified and 30 were transcribed to form the corpus. Of these, three solos representative of distinct phases were analyzed. Based on the corpus, the characteristics of Ornelas\u2019s improvisations were catalogued and compared with the characteristics of his chamber music. Benson (2003), Nettl (1974, 1998), Bailey (1992), Berliner (1994), and Berkowitz (2010) were my theoretical references in an exploration of the concept of improvisation and its relation to composition. Explanatory tables of concepts and techniques in improvisation were then created, each exemplified by excerpts from solos by Ornelas. Lastly, to ascertain the level of consciousness that can be displayed during the act of improvisation, an experiment was conducted in which three soloists played over chord changes unknown to them, extracted from Ornelas\u2019s music; these solos were then transcribed and subjected to melodic analysis. It is argued that consciousness was somehow at work in all takes. It is further argued that the interpretation of any musical piece is polysemantic and that there are more common points than contrasts between improvisation and composition. Finally, the conclusion is reached that Ornelas is a hybrid composer, who combines elements in his popular and classical works.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54093258, "asset_id": 34172546,

"Hans-J\u00fcrgen Buchner, genannt Haindling, ist ein niederbayerischer Musiker und Filmkomponist, der seit 1982 deutschlandweit erfolgreich ist. Sein Musikstil wird von JournalistInnen als \"bayerische Weltmusik\" oder \"Bayern-Pop\" bezeichnet und als musikalisch hybrid beschrieben. Buchner dient in meiner Arbeit als konkretes Beispiel, um zu abstrakten Ergebnissen von \u00fcbergeordneter G\u00fcltigkeit zu kommen. Untersucht wird das Verh\u00e4ltnis von Identit\u00e4t, Ideologie und Musik auf der Individual- und Kollektivebene:\n1. Wie konstituiert Hans-J\u00fcrgen Buchner seine individuelle Identit\u00e4t? Wie steht diese Identit\u00e4t in Beziehung zu seiner Musik?\n2. Wie wird die Musik von Haindling zum Aush\u00e4ngeschild f\u00fcr kollektive Identit\u00e4t? Wie gelingt ihm das \u00fcber ideologische Differenzen hinweg?\nZur Beantwortung des ersten Fragenkomplexes ziehe ich das Modell der \"Patchwork-Identit\u00e4t\" des Soziologen Heiner Keupp als theoretischen Rahmen heran. Sie besagt, dass Identit\u00e4ten in der Sp\u00e4tmoderne kein bruchloses Ganzes mehr sind, sondern aus einer Vielzahl von Erfahrungsfragmenten bestehen. Musik verstehe ich in diesem Zusammenhang mit Simon Frith nicht als Ausdruck von Identit\u00e4t, sondern als Mittel um Identit\u00e4t zu konstruieren. \nIm Falle von Hans-J\u00fcrgen Buchner entsprechen die Bausteine seiner Identit\u00e4t bestimmten Musiken, die ihn positioniert haben und durch die er sich positioniert hat. Das zeige ich anhand  von seiner Biographie bis zum Entstehen seines Personalstils und anhand von musikalischen Analysen einzelner, hybrider Songs.\nDrei Musiken haben Hans-J\u00fcrgen Buchners Identit\u00e4t und sp\u00e4ter seinen Personalstil gepr\u00e4gt: Traditionelle bayerische Tanzmusik, die er w\u00e4hrend seiner Kindheit auf einem niederbayerischen Dorf kennenlernte; anglo-amerikanische Rock- und Popmusik, mit er sich als jugendlicher \"Revoluzzer\" gegen die Strukturen des Klosterinternats auflehnte; und \"exotische\" Musiken, die er als weltoffener Mensch durch Kontakte mit MigrantInnen und Fernreisen kennenlernte. Da er innovative Musik schaffen wollte, die ganz seine Identit\u00e4t ausdr\u00fcckte, entwickelte er einen Personalstil, der Elemente f\u00fcr ihn pr\u00e4gender Musikstile zusammenf\u00fcgt.\nWegen dieses Mischcharakters entsprechen seine Lieder meiner Definition von Hybridit\u00e4t: Einzelne Songs enthalten verschiedene musikalische Elemente, die jeweils mit einem anderen Ort oder Stil assoziiert werden. Die Analyse von 45 Zeitungsartikeln best\u00e4tigt, dass JournalistInnen Buchners Songs als hybrid wahrnehmen. \nWie Buchner die Elemente verschiedener Stile vermischt, zeige ich am Beispiel von drei Songs: \u201eZwiefacher\u201c zum Beispiel verschmilzt Exotisches, 80er Jahre Pop und traditionelle bayerische Tanzmusik. \nIm zweiten Hauptteil r\u00fccken kollektive Identit\u00e4ten in den Fokus: Ideologisch unterschiedliche Gruppen haben Haindlings Musik verschiedene Bedeutungen zugewiesen, um sie f\u00fcr ihr Gemeinschafsgef\u00fchl zu nutzen. Ich benutze dabei den Begriff Ideologie mit Teun van Dijk wertneutral im Sinne von \"Weltsicht\". Da die Gruppenbildungs- und Abgrenzungsprozesse sehr komplex sind, greife ich exemplarisch eine polarisierte Diskursformation heraus: Buchners Verh\u00e4ltnis zu CSU und Bund Naturschutz.\nPr\u00e4gend f\u00fcr Buchners Weltsicht ist die Ideologie des Bund Naturschutz. Die Kritik in Haindlings Umweltschutz-Texten speist sich aus einer romantisch-heimatsch\u00fctzerischen aber zugleich antikapitalistischen Sichtweise. Durch den Auftritt seiner Band beim Anti-WAAhnsinns-Festival 1986 solidarisierte sich Buchner mit dem Protest gegen die geplante Atomm\u00fcll-Wiederaufbereitungsanlage in Wackersdorf. Das Gro\u00dfkonzert schuf eine kollektive Identit\u00e4t der Protestierenden in Abgrenzung von der CSU-gef\u00fchrten Staatsregierung.\nIn den 00er Jahren schlie\u00dflich bekam Buchner mehrere Preise von der bayerischen Staatsregierung und wurde als musikalische Vertretung Bayerns ins Ausland geschickt. Diese Vers\u00f6hnung mit der CSU gelang, weil es ideologische Ankn\u00fcpfungspunkte gab \u2013 zum Beispiel Buchners Engagement f\u00fcr die Erhaltung des bayerischen Dialekts \u2013 und weil die hybride Musik von Haindling sich eignete, um \"Laptop und Lederhosen\" nach au\u00dfen zu repr\u00e4sentieren. Trotzdem war Buchners Verh\u00e4ltnis zum Bund Naturschutz weiterhin gut, er bekam sogar 2008 die Naturschutzmedaille verliehen. \nBeide Gruppen \u2013 Staatsregierung und Bund Naturschutz - versuchten, Buchners Musik f\u00fcr die eigene kollektive Identit\u00e4t zu nutzen, obwohl sie miteinander ideologisch in Konflikt standen. Das war m\u00f6glich, weil Buchners Songs textlich und musikalisch mehrdeutig sind. Eine gutes Beispiel ist sein Lied \"Bayern\": Buchner hat es bewusst stumpfsinnig komponiert, weil er damit das bayerische \"Mir san mir\"-Gef\u00fchl kritisieren wollte. Die Kritik ist aber eher subtil, und wurde wohl oft nicht verstanden: Der Song entwickelte sich zur Bierzelt-Hymne.\nAuf abstrakter Ebene liefert meine Arbeit zwei Haupterkenntnisse: Die Elemente von hybrider Musik k\u00f6nnen den Erfahrungsfragmenten der Patchworkidentit\u00e4t der KomponistIn entsprechen.

In fact, it would be difficult to find any work in this corpus that does not address migration to some extent. This is be\u00ad cause, save some exceptions, the experience of migration is the unifying condition from which Latina/o identities have emerged. All Latinas/os trace their family origins to Latin America and/or the Hispanic Caribbean. That said, not all of them experience migration first-hand or in the same manner; there are many factors that determine why, how, when, and where migration takes place. Yet, despite all of these factors, it is safe to say that a crucial reason behind the mass movements of people from Latin America and the Hispan\u00ad ic Caribbean to the United States has been direct or indirect US involvement in the coun\u00ad tries of origin. This is evident, for instance, in the cases of Puerto Rico (invasion of 1898) and Central America (civil wars in the 1980s), where US intervention led to migration to the United States in the second half of the 20th century. Other factors that tend to affect the experience of migration include nationality, class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, re\u00ad ligion, language, citizenship status, age, ability, and the historical juncture at which mi\u00ad gration takes place. The heterogeneous ways in which migration is represented in Latina/o literature reflect the wide range of factors that influence and shape the experience of migration. Latina/o narrative, poetry, theatre, essay, and other forms of literary expressions capture the di\u00ad versity of the migration experience. Some of the constant themes that emerge in these works include nostalgia, transculturation, discrimination, racism, uprootedness, hybridity, and survival. In addressing these issues, Latina/o literature brings visibility to the com\u00ad plexities surrounding migration and Latina/o identity, while undermining the one-dimen\u00ad sional and negative stereotypes that tend to dehumanize Latinas/os in US dominant soci\u00ad ety. Most importantly, it allows the public to see that while migration is complex and in constant flux, those who experience it are human beings in search for survival.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61157660, "asset_id": 40870749, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1399538, "first_name": "Marisel", "last_name": "Moreno", "domain_name": "nd", "page_name": "MariselMoreno", "display_name": "Marisel  Moreno", "profile_url": "https://nd.academia.edu/MariselMoreno?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1399538/2049858/4464184/s65_marisel.moreno.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10, "name": "American Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Literature?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 388, "name": "Latin American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 390, "name": "American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2395, "name": "Mexican Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mexican_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2418, "name": "Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2817, "name": "Border Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Border_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2940, "name": "Latina/o Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latina_o_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3725, "name": "Cuban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cuban_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3870, "name": "African Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4617, "name": "Central American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Central_American_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 6259, "name": "Caribbean Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caribbean_Literature?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 12570, "name": "Undocumented Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undocumented_Immigration?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 16472, "name": "Transnational migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_migration?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 39436, "name": "Puerto Rican Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Puerto_Rican_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 59470, "name": "Borders and Frontiers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borders_and_Frontiers?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 87925, "name": "US Latino Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/US_Latino_Literature?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 249304, "name": "Borders and Borderlands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borders_and_Borderlands?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 8432484, "title": "Postcolonial Literature, Hybridity and Culture", "created_at": "2014-09-21T23:20:31.564-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8432484/Postcolonial_Literature_Hybridity_and_Culture?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_8432484", "summary": "Forming one of the central themes in the discourse on postcolonial culture/s and indentity/ies, \r\nhybridity is an operative verbalization of ambivalence and mutability illustrating a dynamic stride of \r\nremonstrate and resistance in opposition to a domineering ideological and cultural colonial hegemony. \r\nAs a prime mace against oppressive imperial power and \u2015grand narratives,\u2016 hybridity locates and \r\nechoes the in-betweenness of the self and the other offering a rupture at the binarial and oppositional \r\ndissertation fashioned by the dominant authority.

But these renewals were invigorated by the Council\u2019s relatively positive valuation of the diversity of cultures and religions, as demonstrated, for example, in the Dignitatis humanae Declaration\u2019s acceptance of religious freedom for all humankind. Because of this, in the 1970 and 1980s, the inculturation project thrived in India, manifesting itself in different ways, such as in the Catholic ashram movement, Indianised liturgies and the development of different types of dialogue. \r\nBy the late 1980s, however, the movement was beginning to run out of steam. The inculturation project came to be seen by some Indians as something artificial and imposed, and ferocious critiques against its putatively \u2018imperialist\u2019 origins and tendencies emerged. As we shall see, non-Christian critics like Sita Ram Goel (1988) deemed Catholic Ashrams sinister and predatorial, while within the Church, theologians began to be more vocal about \u2018the need for a reinterpretation of the Gospel in tune with the requirements of radical social action\u2019 (Kappen 1985: ii). Thus, liberation, Dalit, tribal, feminist, and ecological theologies progressively gained momentum, and came to be seen as the new theological vanguard. In this context, intercultural and interreligious initiatives began to languish and lose energy, it seems, while these newer innovative theological movements took the initiative.\r\nBut is the inculturation project now moribund? Are indigenisation and inculturation ventures now irrelevant, nothing more than a pass\u00e9 fad of a bygone era? This paper examines the curious process by which inculturation became tremendously problematic for many (though not all) Indian Christians. My intent is not to critique the theological bases of inculturation in a normative way, but rather to articulate and enumerate the factors that explain its historical decline. The analyses focus mainly on inculturation in the Roman Catholic context, though I will also attend occasionally to Protestant voices. \r\nThe structure of this chapter is quite straightforward. At the beginning, I define the boundaries of my analysis, clarify what is meant by the (Catholic) notion of inculturation (and similar concepts such as indigenisation), and present a short historical review. Afterwards, I examine the factors involved in the decline of inculturation, focusing both on social/political and theological factors. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37811292, "asset_id": 7019355, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 76400, "first_name": "xavier", "last_name": "GRAVEND-TIROLE", "domain_name": "independentscholar", "page_name": "xavierGRAVENDTIROLE", "display_name": "xavier GRAVEND-TIROLE", "profile_url": "https://independentscholar.academia.edu/xavierGRAVENDTIROLE?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/76400/21130/9434977/s65_xavier.gravend-tirole.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 972, "name": "Self and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_and_Identity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2279, "name": "Missiology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Missiology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10348, "name": "Identity Politics (Political Science)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Politics_Political_Science_?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29547, "name": "Interreligious Dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interreligious_Dialogue?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 38097, "name": "Interfaith Dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interfaith_Dialogue?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 45919, "name": "Dalit studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dalit_studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 57430, "name": "Inculturation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Inculturation?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 41040766, "title": "Dispora & Hybridity", "created_at": "2019-11-24T03:32:12.216-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41040766/Dispora_and_Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_41040766", "summary": "'Diaspora and Hybridity deals with those theoretical issues which concern social theory and social change in the new millennium.

The authors demonstrate how diaspora and hybridity serve as problematic tools, cutting across traditional boundaries of nations and groups, where trans-national spaces for a range of contested cultural, political and economic outcomes might arise.\n\nWide ranging, richly illustrated and challenging, it will be of interest to students of cultural studies, sociology, ethnicity and nationalism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61316022, "asset_id": 41040766, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 21360720, "first_name": "Raminder", "last_name": "Kaur", "domain_name": "sussex", "page_name": "RaminderKaur", "display_name": "Raminder Kaur", "profile_url": "https://sussex.academia.edu/RaminderKaur?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/21360720/6787676/17216317/s65_raminder.kaur.jpg"}, {"id": 7371934, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Hutnyk", "domain_name": "tdt", "page_name": "JohnHutnyk", "display_name": "John  Hutnyk", "profile_url": "https://tdt.academia.edu/JohnHutnyk?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7371934/9489688/39527267/s65_john.hutnyk.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2937, "name": "Diasporas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diasporas?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 312147, "title": "Stop, Revive, Survive!: Lessons from the Hebrew Revival Applicable to the Reclamation, Maintenance and Empowerment of Aboriginal Languages and Cultures", "created_at": "2010-08-29T20:29:25.973-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/312147/Stop_Revive_Survive_Lessons_from_the_Hebrew_Revival_Applicable_to_the_Reclamation_Maintenance_and_Empowerment_of_Aboriginal_Languages_and_Cultures?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_312147", "summary": "Zuckermann, Ghil'ad and Walsh, Michael 2011. \u2018Stop, Revive, Survive!: Lessons from the Hebrew Revival Applicable to the Reclamation, Maintenance and Empowerment of Aboriginal Languages and Cultures\u2019, Australian Journal of Linguistics 31.1: 111-127. \r\n\r\nLINK TO THE ARTICLE: http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Revival_Linguistics.pdf\r\n\r\nFinal version:\r\nhttp://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a932426202~frm=titlelink\r\n\r\nDOI: 10.1080/07268602.2011.532859 \r\n\r\nAustralian Journal of Linguistics (AJL)\r\nVolume 31, Issue 1, January 2011, pages 111 - 127 \r\n\r\nStop, Revive, Survive: Lessons from the Hebrew Revival Applicable to the Reclamation, Maintenance and Empowerment of Aboriginal Languages and Cultures\r\n\r\nGHIL\u2018AD ZUCKERMANN and MICHAEL WALSH\r\n\r\nUniversity of Adelaide and University of Sydney\r\n\r\n\r\nABSTRACT \r\n\r\nThe revival of Hebrew is so far the most successful known reclamation of a sleeping tongue and is a language movement that has been in progress for more than 120 years. By comparison, language revival movements in Australia are in their infancy. This article provides comparative insights and makes information about the Hebrew revival accessible to Australian linguists and Aboriginal revival activists. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the first stage of any desire by professional linguists to assist in language reawakening must involve a long period of thoroughly observing, carefully listening to the people, learning, mapping and characterizing the specific indigenous community. Only then can one inspire and assist. That said, this article proposes that there are linguistic constraints applicable to all revival attempts. Mastering them would be useful to endangered languages in general and to Aboriginal linguistic revival in particular. \r\n\r\nThis article contributes towards the establishment of Revival Linguistics, a new linguistic discipline and paradigm. Zuckermann`s term Revival Linguistics is modelled upon 'Contact Linguistics' (<language contact). Revival linguistics inter alia explores the universal constraints and mechanisms involved in language reclamation, renewal and revitalization. It draws perspicacious comparative insights from one revival attempt to another, thus acting as an epistemological bridge between parallel discourses in various local attempts to revive sleeping tongues all over the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeywords: Revival Linguistics, Language Revival, Aboriginal Studies, Hebrew, Social Empowerment, Hybridity and Multiple Causation, Purism versus Compromise, Language and Identity, Contact Linguistics, Yiddish, Aboriginal English, Anthropological Linguistics, Sociolinguistics, Language Endangerment, Resilience Linguistics, Revitalization, Renewal.\r\n\r\n\r\nDedicated to Professor Michael Clyne z\"l\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE\r\n\r\n\"I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy.

'Language is power; let us have ours', wrote Aboriginal politician Aden Ridgeway on 26 November 2009 in the Sydney Morning Herald. Previous revival efforts have largely failed (for obvious reasons, we are not going to single out specific failures here). While there have been some good results from several projects since 1992 (e.g. Kaurna, see below), Aboriginal people overall do not see as many positive outcomes from revival programmes as they would like. In large part this is the result of shortage of sufficient (continuity of) funding, lack of technical expertise, and lack of integration of school-based programmes with community language programmes. However, there are purely linguistic reasons too: Many revival efforts were not supported by a sound theoretical understanding of how successful language revival works. As pointed out by Thieberger (2002), decisions about the appropriate target for language maintenance programmes are too often driven by structural linguistics, where the supposed ideal is intergenerational transmission of the language with all its original structural complexity retained, thus creating unrealistic expectations among the Aboriginal community. \r\n\t\r\nThis article is the first of its kind as it will innovatively draw crucial insights from 'Modern Hebrew' (henceforth, Israeli \u2013 see Zuckermann 1999), so far the most successful known reclamation attempt of a sleeping tongue. Zuckermann's (2008a, 2009, 2010, 2011) research on Israeli demonstrates which language components are more revivable than others. Words and conjugations, for example, are easier to revitalize than intonation, discourse, associations and connotations. We should encourage revivalists and Aboriginal leaders to be realistic rather than puristic, and not to chastise English loanwords and pronunciation, for example, within the emergent language. Applying such precious conclusions from Hebrew will closely assist Australian revivalists in being more efficient, urging them not to waste time and resources on Sisyphean efforts to resuscitate linguistic components that are unlikely to be revivable.\r\n\t\r\nWhile the results the endeavors we are proposing here have considerable value as a research enterprise, one can also consider them in terms of a cost-benefit analysis (M\u00fchlh\u00e4usler and Damania 2004, Walsh 2008): Language revitalization contributes to social reconciliation, cultural tourism (Clark and Kostanski 2005), capacity building, and improved community health for Indigenous peoples (Walsh forthcoming B). In the process of language revival, some Aboriginal people will go from being dysfunctional (cf. Sutton 2009) to well-balanced, positive people. The benefits to the wider community and to Australian society are immense.\r\n\r\nReversing language shift (RLS) (Fishman 1991, 2001, Hag\u00e8ge 2009, Evans 2010, Walsh 2005a, Zuckermann 2011) is thus of great social benefit. Language revival does not only do historical justice and address inequality but can also result in the empowerment of people who have lost their heritage and purpose in life. \r\n\t\r\nSome Aboriginal people distinguish between usership and ownership. There are even those who claim that they own a language although they only know one single word of it: its name. Consequently, some Indigenous Australians do not find it important to revive their comatose tongue. We, on the other hand, have always believed in Australia\u2019s very own roadside dictum: \u2018Stop, revive, survive!'\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground: The Hebrew Revival\r\n\r\nI suppose the process of acceptance will pass through the usual four stages: 1. This is worthless nonsense. 2. This is an interesting, but perverse, point of view. 3. This is true, but quite unimportant. 4. I always said so. (Haldane 1963: 464)\r\n\r\n'Hebrew' is the most quoted example of a successful language revival. On the other hand, if we are to be brutally truthful with ourselves, the modern-day vernacular spoken in downtown Tel Aviv is a very different language \u2013 both typologically and genetically \u2013 to that of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) or of the Mishnah, the first major redaction of Jewish oral traditions.\r\n\t\r\nHebrew was spoken since approximately the 14th century BC. It belonged to the Canaanite division of the northwestern branch of the Semitic languages, which constitute a branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family. Following a gradual decline, it ceased to be spoken by the second century AD. The failed Bar-Kokhba Revolt against the Romans in Judea in 132-5 AD marks the symbolic end of the period of spoken Hebrew. We believe that the Mishnah was codified around 200 AD because Hebrew was then dying as a mother tongue. Rabbi Judah haNasi and his collaborators might have realized that if they did not act then to redact the oral tradition, it would soon have been too late because Jews were already speaking languages other than Hebrew. (In fact, the Gemara, the other component of the Babylonian Talmud, which was codified around 500 AD, was written in Aramaic rather than in Hebrew.)\r\n\t\r\nFor approximately 1,750 years thereafter, Hebrew was \u2018clinically dead\u2019. A most important liturgical and literary language, it occasionally served as a lingua franca \u2013 a means of communication between people who do not share a mother tongue \u2013 for Jews of the Diaspora, but not as a native language.\r\n\t\r\nFascinating and multifaceted Israeli, which emerged in Palestine (Eretz Israel) at the end of the nineteenth century, possesses distinctive socio-historical characteristics such as the lack of a continuous chain of native speakers from spoken Hebrew to Israeli, the non-Semitic mother tongues spoken by the Hebrew revivalists, and the European impact on literary Hebrew. Consequently, it presents the linguist with a unique laboratory in which to examine a wider set of theoretical problems concerning language genesis, social issues like language, identity and politics, and important practical matters, such as whether it is possible to revive a no-longer spoken language.\r\n\r\nThe genetic classification of Israeli has preoccupied scholars since its genesis. The still regnant traditional thesis suggests that Israeli is Semitic: Hebrew revived. The revisionist antithesis defines Israeli as Indo-European: Yiddish relexified; that is, Yiddish, the revivalists\u2019 mother tongue, is the 'substratum', whilst Hebrew is the 'superstratum' providing the vocabulary (cf. Horvath and Wexler 1997). According to Zuckermann's mosaic (rather than Mosaic) synthesis, Israeli is not only multi-layered but also multi-parental. A Semito-European, or Eurasian, hybrid, Israeli is both Semitic (Afro-Asiatic) and (Indo-) European. It is based simultaneously on 'sleeping beauty' / 'walking dead' Hebrew and 'm\u00e1me l\u00f3shn' (mother tongue) Yiddish, which are both primary contributors to Israeli, and a plethora of other tongues spoken by Jewish pioneers in Palestine in the 1880s\u20131930s, e.g. Russian, Polish, Arabic, Ladino (Judeo-Spanish), Turkish, German, French and English.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Success Rate of the Hebrew Revival\r\n\r\nThe vernacularization of Hebrew was partially a success and partially a failure. It is hard to provide an exact quantification for such a multi-variable enterprise, but we would roughly estimate that on a 1-10 scale, 10 being a complete success and one being a complete failure, the Hebrew revival is at seven. More specifically, we propose the following continuum approximations for the extent to which Israeli can be considered Hebrew: mindset/spirit: 1 (i.e. European); discourse (communicative tools, speech acts): 1; sounds (phonetics and phonology): 2; semantics (meaning, associations, connotations, semantic networkings): 3; constituent/word order (syntax): 4; general vocabulary: 5; word formation: 7; verbal conjugations: 9; and basic vocabulary: 10 (i.e. Hebrew).\r\n\t\r\nThe factors leading to the partial failure of the Hebrew revival have little to do with a lack of motivation or zealousness, or with economic or political variables \u2013 not even with the fact that the revivalists, such as the symbolic father of Israeli, Eliezer Ben-Yehuda (born Perelman, 1858-1922), were not as linguistically sophisticated as contemporary linguists. It is simply the case that one cannot negate one\u2019s most recent roots, be they cultural or linguistic, even if one is keen to deny one\u2019s parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 heritage (diasporic Yiddish) in search of cultural antiquity (Biblical Hebrew). It is therefore most unlikely to revive a clinically-dead language without cross-fertilization from the revivalists\u2019 mother tongue(s). Thus, when most native Israeli-speakers speak Israeli, their intonation is much more similar to that of Yiddish, the mother tongue of most revivalists, than to that of Arabic or any other Semitic language. It is high time to acknowledge that Israeli is very different from ancient Hebrew. We should embrace \u2013 rather than chastise \u2013 the multisourcedness of Israeli.\r\n\r\nThat said, the Hebrew revival cannot be considered a failure because without the zealous, obsessive, enthusiastic efforts of Ben-Yehuda and of teachers, writers, poets, journalists, intellectuals, social activists, political figures, linguists and others, Israelis would have spoken a language (such as English, German, Arabic or Yiddish) that could hardly be considered Hebrew. To call such a hypothetical language 'Hebrew' would have not only been misleading but also wrong. To call today\u2019s Israeli 'Hebrew' may be puristic but not wrong: Hybridic Israeli is based on Hebrew as much as it is based on Yiddish. So, although the revivalists could not avoid the subconscious influence of their mother tongue(s), they did indeed manage at the same time to consciously revive important components of Hebrew.\r\n\r\n\r\nHybridity, Camouflage and the Congruence Principle\r\n\r\nIsraeli is a new hybrid language rather than an evolutionary phase of Hebrew. Yiddish is not a 'foreign language' vis-\u00e0-vis Israeli, and the word intu\u00edtsya 'intuition' \u2013 to give but one example out of thousands of alleged loan words \u2013 is not a loan word (from Yiddish intu\u00edtsye, Russian intu\u00edtsiya, Polish intuicja etc., all meaning 'intuition') but rather an integral part of Israeli from its very beginning.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Congruence Principle, the more revivalists speak contributing languages with a specific linguistic feature, the more likely this feature is to prevail in the emergent language. Based on feature pool statistics, this principle weakens August Schleicher\u2019s famous Family Tree theory in historical linguistics, which may give the wrong impression that every language has only one parent. For example, most revivalists spoke languages, mainly Yiddish, that lacked that Semitic pharyngeal gulp \u2018ayin (represented, for instance, by the apostrophe in Zuckermann's Christian \u2013 actually Jewish \u2013 name Ghil\u2018ad). Naturally, their children \u2013 the ones who, in fact, shaped the real character of Israeli \u2013 could not buy the argument 'do as I say, don\u2019t do as I do!' The result is that most Israelis do not have this sound in their speech.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, m\u00e1 nishm\u00e0, the common Israeli 'what\u2019s up?' greeting, looks like a calque \u2013 loan translation \u2013 of the Yiddish phrase vos h\u00e9rt zikh, usually pronounced vs\u00e9rtsekh and literally meaning 'what\u2019s heard?' but functioning as a common greeting. However, a Romanian-speaking immigrant to Israel might have used m\u00e1 nishm\u00e0 because of Romanian ce se aude, a Polish-speaker Jew because of Polish co s\u0142ycha\u0107, and a Russian-speaker \u0427\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u043d\u043e chto slyshno, all meaning the same and functioning in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between forms and patterns is crucial here as it demonstrates multiple causation. In the 1920s and 1930s, gdud megin\u00e9y hasaf\u00e1, 'the language defendants regiment' (cf. Shur 2000), whose motto was ivr\u00ed, dab\u00e9r ivr\u00edt 'Hebrew [i.e. Jew], speak Hebrew,' used to tear down signs written in 'foreign' languages and disturb Yiddish theatre gatherings. However, the members of this group only looked for Yiddish forms, rather than patterns in the speech of the Israelis who did choose to speak 'Hebrew.' The language defendants would thus not attack an Israeli speaker saying m\u00e1 nishm\u00e0. Ironically, even the language defendants regiment's anthem included calques from Yiddish.\r\n\r\nZuckermann (2011, forthcoming) analyzes the hitherto-overlooked camouflaged semantic networking transferred from one language to another. Whereas mechanisms as calques (loan translations such as superman, from German \u00dcbermensch), phono-semantic matches (e.g. crayfish, from Old French crevice, a cognate of crab that has little to do with fish) (Zuckermann 2003) and portmanteau blends (e.g. motel, from motor+hotel, or sprummer, from spring+summer) have been studied, there is a need to uncover concealed semantic links between words in the Target Language which reflect \u2013 often subconsciously \u2013 semantic networking in the Source Language. Consider the Israeli word gakhlil\u00edt 'firefly, glow-worm' \u2013 coined by poet laureate Hayyim Nahman Bialik (1873-1934). This word is semantically and etymologically linked to the Biblical Hebrew word ga\u0127elet 'burning coal, glowing ember.' Morphologically, Israeli gakhlil\u00edt derives from Hebrew ga\u0127elet plus the reduplication of its third radical [l]. However, no Israeli dictionary reveals the crucial semantic networking aspect, namely that the Israeli concoction, gakhlil\u00edt, in using an element associated with 'glow,' in fact replicates a European mindset, apparent for example in the Yiddish word gliv\u00f3rem, literally 'glow' (cf. ga\u0127elet) + 'worm', or in German Gl\u00fchw\u00fcrmchen.\r\n\r\n\r\nNative Israeli Speech and the Academy of the Hebrew Language\r\n\r\nSince its conception, Israeli has been the subject of purism (the dislike of foreign words \u2013 as in Icelandic: Sapir and Zuckermann 2008) and the enforcement of 'correct' pronunciation. Brought into being by legislation in 1953 as the supreme institute for 'Hebrew', the Academy of the Hebrew Language (known in Israeli as haakademya lalash\u00f3n haivr\u00edt) is funded by Israel's Ministry of Education. It superseded the (Hebrew) Language Council (v\u00e1ad halash\u00f3n (haivr\u00edt)), which was established in 1889 \u2013 as a branch of Saf\u00e1 Brur\u00e1 (Clear Language) \u2013 by Ben-Yehuda and colleagues. As defined in its constitution, the Academy's functions are: (1) To investigate and compile the Hebrew lexicon according to its historical strata and layers; (2) To study the structure, history, and offshoots of the Hebrew language; and (3) To direct the development of Hebrew in light of its nature, requirements, and potential, its daily and academic needs, by setting its lexicon, grammar, characters, orthography and transliteration [in fact, transcription].\r\n\r\nThe first goal is most useful, as Israeli is indeed a multi-layered language. For example, one could say both (a) khashkh\u00fa en\u00e1v, literally 'His eyes became dark,' meaning 'He saw black' (\u2018black\u2019 in this context meaning \u2018bad news\u2019), and (b) niy\u00e1/naas\u00e1 lo kh\u00f3shekh baen\u00e1im, meaning the same, albeit structurally different. While khashkh\u00fa en\u00e1v is Hebrew, niy\u00e1 lo kh\u00f3shekh baen\u00e1im is a calque of the Yiddish phrase siz im gev\u00f3rn f\u00edntster in di \u00f3ygn, which might in turn be an adaptation of the very Hebrew khashkh\u00fa en\u00e1v (transcribed here in its Israeli form, which would have been unintelligible for an ancient Hebrew-speaker).\r\n\r\nIsraeli has many other minimal pairs, such as as\u00e1 din leatsm\u00f3 and lak\u00e1kh et hakh\u00f3k layad\u00e1im, both referring to a person violating the law, with the latter being more colloquial; as well as lel\u00f3t kayam\u00edm, literally 'nights as days' (also yam\u00edm kelel\u00f3t, literally 'days as nights'), and misav\u00edv lasha\u00f3n, literally 'round the clock,' both often referring to hard work.\r\n\r\nSomewhat resembling the 'catastrophic success' of the 1928-1936 Turkish Language Revolution (see Lewis 1999), many referents have several Israeli signifiers, one of which is puristically Hebrew and the other, often more commonly used, 'foreign' (in fact, Israeli ab initio). These include many internationalisms such as opoz\u00edtsya 'Opposition' (according to the Academy, the word should be negd\u00e1 \u2013 cf. Hebrew n\u00e9ged 'against') and koal\u00edtsya 'Coalition' (according to the Academy: yakhd\u00e1 \u2013 cf. Hebrew ya\u0127ad 'together').\r\n\r\nHowever, goal (3), to direct the development of Hebrew in light of its nature, is oxymoronic (cf. Zuckermann 2008b: 139). If the nature of a language is to evolve in a specific direction (cf. Sapir's 'drift,' the pattern of change in which the structure of a language shifts in a determinate direction), why direct its evolution by language policing?\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Promised Land to the \u2018Lucky\u2019 Country \r\n\r\nThe three principles of linguistic revival and survival: \r\n(1) If your language is endangered --> Do not allow it to \r\n die! \r\n(2) If your language died --> Stop, revive, survive!\r\n(3) If you revive your language --> Embrace the \r\n hybridity of the emergent language!\r\n\r\nQuestions of this kind, albeit in an implicit and sometimes confused fashion, are being raised within the context of Australian Aboriginal languages. Current language revival activities are worthy but often under-theorized. The tendency has been to attempt to revive the language en masse despite what has been indicated about the Hebrew rate of success for take up of particular components of language. There is a need to examine a range of existing language revitalization programmes with a view to assessing the rate of success for take up of particular components of language and at the same time adduce the preferences (and sometimes the prejudices) of the group in question (cf. Couzens and Eira forthcoming).\r\n\t\r\nIndigenous Australians have been living in Australia for more than 40,000 years. Today Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders make up 2.6% of Australia's population. Unfortunately, one of the main findings of the most recent National Indigenous Languages Survey Report (2005) was that the situation of Australia\u2019s languages is grave (in both senses). Of an original number of over 250 known Australian Indigenous languages, only about 145 Indigenous languages are still spoken and the vast majority of these, about 110, are critically endangered: they are spoken only by small groups of people, mostly over 40 years old. Eighteen languages are strong in the sense of being spoken by all age groups, but three or four of these are showing some disturbing signs of moving into endangerment. So of an original number of over 250 known Australian Indigenous languages, only 6% (i.e. 15) are in a healthy condition.\r\n\t\r\nAboriginal language revival began recently \u2013 from the late 1970s (Amery and Gale 2007) \u2013 and has therefore much to learn from other revival efforts, especially that of Hebrew, which began in the late nineteenth century. There has been little coordination among the geographically-scattered language revival efforts in Australia. Most recently, language revitalization practitioners have begun to share experiences at various conferences and workshops (Hobson et al. forthcoming). There is thus an urgent need for an on-the-ground, ongoing input, creating intellectual and practical synergy and complementing the mission of the regional Aboriginal language centres and the recently-established mobile language team based at the University of Adelaide \u2013 by adding significant advice based on scholarly and universal perspectives. Practical outcomes will include a useful handbook of the best practices for language revival in Australia (Christina Eira, pers. comm.), and an improved sense of well being in the local Aboriginal community.\r\n\t\r\nThere is community support in some parts of the country for revival and heritage learning programmes: either in reclamation proper (e.g. extensive courses similar to Israel\u2019s ulpan\u00edm) or only in symbolic, postvernacular maintenance (teaching Aboriginal people some words and concepts related to the dead language \u2013 cf. postvernacular Yiddish among secular Jews in the United States \u2013 see Shandler 2005). At its broadest level language revival refers to the range of strategies for increasing knowledge and use of a language which is no longer spoken fully across all generations. In practice, however, this can range from largely symbolic uses of ancestral languages like naming buildings or places through to more constant involvement with the language through school-based language instruction (Walsh 2005a).\r\n\r\n\r\nComparative Analysis of Hebrew and Aboriginal Language Revival \r\n\r\nAlthough they too were at the beginning very few in number, and encountered great hostility and animosity (e.g. by those who saw the revival as the desecration of a holy tongue), the Hebrew revivalists had several advantages compared with Australian revivalists. Consider the following:\r\n\r\n(1) Documentation: extensive \u2013 consider, for example, the Hebrew Bible and the Mishnah. \r\n\r\n(2) Accessibility: Jews have been exposed to literary Hebrew throughout the generations, e.g. when praying in the synagogue or when saying the blessing over the meal. It would be hard to find a Jew who did not have access to Hebrew (unless in totalitarian regimes such as the Soviet Union).\r\n\r\n(3) Prestige: Hebrew was considered a prestigious language (as opposed to Yiddish, for instance, whose Australian sociolinguistic parallel might be Aboriginal English). It is true that some Aboriginal languages are held in high regard by their owners/custodians but unfortunately usually not by the wider Australian society.\r\n\r\n(4) Uniqueness: Jews from all over the globe only had Hebrew in common (Aramaic was not as prominent), whereas there are dozens of 'sleeping' Aboriginal languages and it would be hard to choose only one unifying tongue, unless one resorts to Aboriginal English. The revival of a single language is much more manageable than that of numerous tongues in varying states of disrepair.\r\n\r\n(5) National self-determination: revived Hebrew was aimed to be the language of an envisioned state, where speakers of Revived Hebrew would eventually have the political power (cf. Yadin and Zuckermann 2010).\r\n\r\n(6) Lack of ownership: Unlike in the case of Aboriginal languages (cf. Walsh 2002), anybody has the right to speak Hebrew, without getting permission from the Jews.\r\n\r\n(7) Easy borrowing: Loanwords and foreign words are not considered theft. In fact, Eliezer Ben-Yehuda loved borrowing from Arabic, Aramaic and other Semitic languages.\r\n\r\n(8) Lack of place restriction: Hebrew could be and was revived all over the globe \u2013 consider Haim Leib Hazan\u2019s coinage mishkaf\u00e1im \u2018glasses\u2019 in 1890 in Grodno (see Zuckermann 2003: 1-4).\r\n\r\n(9) Multilingualism: Jews arriving in Eretz Israel in the time of the revival were used to multilingualism and did not have a \u2018monolingual mindset\u2019. For example, back in Europe many of them spoke Yiddish at home and Polish in the market, and prayed in Hebrew (and Aramaic) in the synagogue.\r\n\r\n(10) Number: There are many more Jews than Aboriginal people in Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, as it happens, Aboriginal revivalists actually have some advantages vis-\u00e0-vis Hebrew revivalists. Consider the following:\r\n\r\n(1) Deontological reason for the revival: As we see it, Aboriginal tongues deserve to be revived for historical, humanistic and social justice, inter alia addressing inequality (cf. Thieberger 1990). This can provide strength to the revival attempts. We hear again and again 'native title' but where is the 'native tongue title'? Is land more important than langue and (cultural) lens? And if land, langue and heritage are bound together as a trinity, then why ask for reparation only for land?\r\n\r\n(2) Numerous utilitarian reasons for the revival: The revival of sleeping Aboriginal languages can result in personal, educational and economic empowerment, sense of pride and higher self-esteem of people who have lost their heritage and purpose in life (see concluding remarks). The Hebrew revival had many less utilitarian purposes, the main one being simply the constitution of a unifying tongue to Jews from all over the world. It would have been unfair, for example, for Ladino-speaking Sephardim if German were selected.\r\n\r\n(3) Governmental support: Although it could obviously be greater, the Australian government does support the reclamation and maintenance of Aboriginal languages, or at least there is an obvious address to apply for money from. This has not been the case in fin-de-si\u00e8cle Palestine. \r\n\r\n(4) Similarities between Aboriginal English and Aboriginal Languages: Aboriginal English (e.g. Nunga English in Adelaide), spoken by some revivalists, contain various linguistic features \u2013 such as connotations, associations, sounds and morphological characteristics like the dual \u2013 of the reclaimed Aboriginal languages at stake. One might perspicaciously argue that Israeli semantics, which is deeply modelled on Yiddish semantics, also maintains the original Hebrew semantics after all because Yiddish, a Germanic language with Romance substratum, was deeply impacted by Hebrew and Aramaic. However, the Yiddish dialects that have been the most influential ones in Israel, e.g. Polish Yiddish, are, in fact, the ones that underwent Slavonization from the thirteenth century onwards, when Jews moved from Germany to Slavonic-speaking areas in Eastern Europe. Aboriginal English is much younger and therefore is much more likely to retain features of Aboriginal languages, than Yiddish is to retain features of Hebrew.\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversal Constraints of Language Revival\r\n\r\nAnd yet, although obviously language revival attempts should be tailored to the specific contexts, needs and desires of each community, there are some universal constraints that should be recognized. As we have already seen, Hebrew revivalists, who wished to speak pure Hebrew, failed in their imprisoning purism prism, the result being a multifaceted and fascinating fin-de-si\u00e8cle Israeli language, both multi-layered and multi-sourced. Most relevantly, some Australian interest groups (cf. Tiwi in Dorian 1994: 481-4) get hung up on misled views akin to the slogan \u2018Give me authenticity or give me death!\u2019 (cf. \u2018Give me Liberty, or give me Death!\u2019, the famous quotation attributed to Patrick Henry from a speech he made to the Virginia Convention in America on 23 March 1775), where the death, of course, ends up being the Indigenous language they wish to save from \u2018contamination\u2019! (On authenticity and language revival, see also Wong 1999 and Hinton and Ahlers 1999.)\r\n\t\r\nWhy should we encourage revivalists and Aboriginal leaders to be realistic rather than puristic? Purism creates unrealistic expectations that may discourage learners from acquiring the emerging language. A revived language should not be viewed negatively if it is seen to be influenced by a neighbouring language or by English. The use of words from a neighbouring language should not discredit the revived language. There might be some rare occasions when it is more appropriate for revivalists to favour purism \u2013 see Harlow (1993) on Maori. However, in the case of reclamation proper (i.e. the revival of a language that has no native speakers such as Hebrew), one must learn to embrace, celebrate and champion \u2013 rather than chastise \u2013 the inevitable hybridity of the emerging language.\r\n\t\r\nOne might argue that the difference between the conditions that surround Aboriginal languages and Israeli are so large that it is impossible to learn across these contexts. But denying universal traits or constraints in human language in general, and in reversing language shift in particular, is counter-productive. Linguistic reality lies between relativism and universalism. No progress will be made by turning a blind eye to any of these extremes. Based on a critical analysis of Israeli, one can predict accurately the situation in various reclaimed Aboriginal languages such as Kaurna [ga:na], a resurrected language spoken around Adelaide, which is the result of one of the most successful revival attempts in Australia \u2013 cf. Gumbaynggirr (Ash et. al. forthcoming), Ngarrindjeri, Walmajarri and Kamilaroi/Gamilaraay.\r\n\t\r\nThere are scholars, e.g. Dalby (2003: 250), who scoff at some attempts at reviving the use of an endangered language: 'this is no longer a language, any more than musicians are speaking Italian when they say andante and fortissimo. These are simply loanwords used in a special context'. A more balanced view is manifested in Crystal's (2000: 162) comments on Kaurna:\r\n\r\nThe revived language is not the same as the original language, of course; most obviously, it lacks the breadth of functions which it originally had, and large amounts of old vocabulary are missing. But, as it continues in present-day use, it will develop new functions and new vocabulary, just as any other living language would, and as long as people value it as a true marker of their identity, and are prepared to keep using it, there is no reason to think of it as anything other than a valid system of communication.\r\n\r\nThe impact of English (Aboriginal or Australian English) on reclaimed Kaurna is far-reaching. Consider the following:\r\n\r\n* At the level of phonology, there are often spelling pronunciations, especially for sequences of er (as in yerlo \u2018sea\u2019 and yerta for instance), ur (as in purle or purlaitye). In classical Kaurna, the r in these words belonged with the consonant (it was be retroflex) but many times we hear an er vowel as in English slur or sir. The original vowel was /a/ in yerlo and yerta, and /u/ in purle and purlaitye. Stress is often placed on the second syllable rather than on the first (Amery 2000: 121-122; Amery and Rigney 2004: 2-3).\r\n\r\n* At the level of vocabulary, there are many calques \u2013 see Amery 2000: 124, as well as Chapter 12 Wodlingga 'In the Home' (pp. 63-70), Chapter 15 Tidnaparndo 'Football' (pp. 81-84) and Chapter 16 Kuya Pirri-wirkindi 'Fishing' (pp. 85-88) in Amery (2007), where a range of calques have been developed \u2013 especially evident in the names of AFL football teams such as Kuinyunda Meyunna (lit. 'sacred men') for the St Kilda Saints. Knowingly \u2013 and jocularly \u2013 cricket (the sport game) was replicated as yertabiritti (the term for the insect with the same name in English) (Amery 2003: 86). It should be noted, however, that in reclaimed Kaurna there are relatively few loanwords/foreignisms from English per se, far less than we see in any \u2018strong\u2019 language such as Pitjantjatjara or Yolngu Matha.\r\n\r\n* Constituent/word order is free in classical Kaurna as in other Aboriginal languages, though it tended to be SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). Naturally, there are contemporary users of Kaurna who tend to produce more SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) sentences, replicating English (Amery and Rigney 2004: 5).\r\n\r\n* English semantics tends to carry through to Kaurna words (Amery and Rigney 2004: 5-7).\r\n\r\n* The most pervasive influence from English is at the level of discourse. Almost everything said or written is translated from English. Thus, the turn of phrase and the idiom are from English (Amery 2001a: 190-194; Amery 2001b; see also Amery and Rigney 2006).\r\n\r\nAnd still, the impact of English on Kaurna is less than in many other revived languages in Australia \u2013 cf. the neighbouring Ngarrindjeri, where published texts are practically English calques: an isomorphic 1 to 1 translation of English, including the use of interrogative \u2018where\u2019 for \u2018were\u2019 and \u2018thus\u2019 for \u2018the\u2019. Case suffixes are used as prepositions \u2013 see p. iii of Reviving Languages: warranna purruttiappendi: tumbelin tungarar: renewal and reclamation programs for indigenous languages in schools (1999), as well as Rhonda Agius in Proctor and Gale (1997: 4-6). \r\n\t\r\nWe predict that any attempt to revive an Aboriginal language will result in a hybrid, combining components from Australian English, Aboriginal English, Kriol, other Aboriginal languages and the target Aboriginal tongue. But we are going to assist Aboriginal revivalists to make their efforts more efficient and to embrace hybridity.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcluding Remarks\r\n\r\nIf you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart. (Nelson Mandela)\r\n\r\nThis article contributes towards the establishment of Revival Linguistics, a new linguistic discipline and paradigm. Zuckermann`s term Revival Linguistics is modelled upon 'Contact Linguistics' (<language contact). Revival linguistics inter alia explores the universal constraints and mechanisms involved in language reclamation, renewal and revitalization. It draws perspicacious comparative insights from one revival attempt to another, thus acting as an epistemological bridge between parallel discourses in various local attempts to revive sleeping tongues all over the globe.\r\n\t\r\nThere is a need to map the revival attempts throughout Aboriginal Australia by (1) assessing the success of the revival so far; and (2) categorizing the specific need on a continuum of revival efforts, e.g. reclamation (e.g. Kaurna), renewal (e.g. Ngarrindjeri) and revitalization (e.g. Walmajarri) \u2013 cf. other RE-terms to be defined such as restoration, resurrection, resuscitation, reinvigoration, reintroduction, regenesis, revernacularization, reawakening, rebirth and renaissance.\r\n\t\r\nNeedless to say, even if there is eventually a sound understanding and awareness of the linguistic/sociolinguistic issues involved and even if the endeavour is well-theorised, language revival efforts may well still fail. Internal factional politics are likely to be far more influential in deciding the fate of a language revival movement that any linguistic theory or lack of one. There is no doubt that the first stage of any desire by professional linguists to assist in language revival involves a long initial period of carefully observing, listening, learning and characterizing each indigenous community specifically. Only then can we inspire and assist. That said, this article proposes that there are linguistic constraints applicable to all revival attempts. Mastering them would be most useful to endangered languages in general and to Aboriginal linguistic revival in particular. \r\n\t\r\nWhile we know that language revitalization can have numerous beneficial effects, we also know that some revival efforts are more successful than others (see Walsh forthcoming A). A better understanding of success in this arena by surveying numerous language reinvigoration efforts in Australia, and by drawing on lessons from the Hebrew revival, will enable less waste of resources and better outcomes. Besides significant scholarly impact and intellectual benefits, the results of such endeavours will also improve substantially the future of Australia's Indigenous communities, promoting and maintaining their physical, spiritual and cultural good health through:\r\n\r\n(1) Transformation of disturbed individuals;\r\n\r\n(2) Capacity building: Some Aboriginal people will undertake training only because they are interested in language(s). However, what they will learn in the process are useful generic skills such as literacy, computer literacy, conducting research and giving speeches in public;\r\n\r\n(3) Improved sense of well being in the local Aboriginal community;\r\n\r\n(4) Reconciliation and potential decrease in racism towards Aboriginal people in some country centres;\r\n\r\n(5) Promoting cultural tourism to Aboriginal areas in order to learn about their cultures and languages.\r\n\r\nRegaining language is a life-changing experience for many Aboriginal people. One Aboriginal person has told us that he used to be angry, often drunk and in trouble with police and his home life was a mess. Two years later, when he had regained his language, his situation had turned around and his family life had greatly improved.\r\n\r\nThrough this and other experiences we became convinced that a small investment in language revitalization could yield very significant dividends. Language revival can result in the saving of vast amounts of money and resources going into housing, social services and health intervention to little effect. A small investment into language revitalization can make an enormous difference to society. Public health can benefit from language intervention.\r\n\t\r\nTo date such money as has been devoted to Aboriginal language revival and maintenance has not been well targeted. This is partly because Australian Indigenous language policies have been piecemeal and un-coordinated at best or otherwise non-existent or implicit (Liddicoat 2008, McKay 2007, 2009, Truscott and Malcolm forthcoming; see also http://www.anu.edu.au/linguistics/nash/ aust/policy.html \u2013 accessed 6 July 2010). We aim at a better informed Indigenous language policy at the national level, as well as in particular institutional contexts. For instance, in considering Indigenous policies of Australian universities, Gunstone (2008: 107) complains: \u2018it is apparent that universities are still largely failing to adequately address the educational needs of Indigenous staff, students and communities.\u2019\r\n\t\r\nAs cellist Yo Yo Ma said on 28 November 2000 at the White House Conference on Culture and Diplomacy:\r\n\r\nA Senegalese poet said 'In the end we will conserve only what we love. We love only what we understand, and we will understand only what we are taught.' We must learn about other cultures in order to understand, in order to love, and in order to preserve our common world heritage.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nAmery, Rob 2000.

investigates the Egyptian valuation of imported Minoan and locally produced Minoanizing pottery: that is, why Egyptians found this pottery desirable, which Egyptians wanted it, and which were able to acquire it. In order to address these questions, this study first reviews the archaeological contexts of all Minoan and Minoanizing pottery in Egypt, and then compares this archaeological evidence to the textual and iconographic data on Egyptian attitudes towards Minoan goods. The results suggest that while ownership of this pottery may have carried some cultural cachet as a mark of cosmopolitan sensibilities, it was not restricted to the highest officials. Instead, the more widespread availability of Minoan and Minoanizing pottery may have enabled Egyptians from various socioeconomic backgrounds to participate in an internationalizing cultural milieu.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35623660, "asset_id": 370179, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 281995, "first_name": "Caitl\u00edn E.", "last_name": "Barrett", "domain_name": "cornell", "page_name": "Caitl\u00ednEBarrett", "display_name": "Caitl\u00edn E.

It is a practice-based project that produces a theoretical and creative space in which a theory of the \u2018voice of the machine\u2019 is discovered and tested. Through a series of research chapters and critical reflections this thesis tests ideas of dictation, translation, inscription and embodiment using the poetic device of the disembodied \u2014 or acousmatic \u2014 voice as a fundamental theoretical framework, which in turn informs my practice. I begin with a study of Jack Spicer\u2019s book After Lorca, a collection of translated poems that are dictated to Spicer by the ghost of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca. Using the work of Mladen Dolar, I explore the idea of the acousmatic voice and the processes of translation that emerge from this when one is in communion with the dead. From this I identify a \u2018network of tradition\u2019: Spicer\u2019s matrix of historical, poetic associations to which belongs W.B. Yeats, another poet who used spirit dictation in composition. I focus on the practice of Yeats\u2019s wife, George, who, acting as a medium, produced hundreds of manuscripts of automatic writing and drawing. Through a study of Johanna Drucker\u2019s notion of graphesis, via discussions on choreography, I establish George Yeats as a spiritual writing machine whose practice works as an acoustic register of ghostly dictation and audition. I consider the idea of katabasis \u2014 an Orphic descent to retrieve a voice \u2014 that underpins Spicer\u2019s poetics in After Lorca and I use this as a catalyst to enact gestures of archival katabasis \u2014 in pursuit of George Yeats \u2014 and what I term as the kata_BASIC, which is a descent into the machine to retrieve its voice. Using the random-chance poetics of Jackson Mac Low as a practice methodology I understand the voice of the machine to be an expression of its agency and computational processes, which are materialised in machine-mediated interventions such as the glitch. The practice I produce in this project \u2014 poetry, objects, video and sound \u2014 tests ideas of translation, acoustic imagery, hybridity and transcreation in light of the idea of a shared voice of collaboration that exists between the machine and the archived or disembodied voices that it (re)mediates.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55945921, "asset_id": 36060289, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2885491, "first_name": "Daniel", "last_name": "O'Donnell-Smith", "domain_name": "birbeck", "page_name": "DanielODonnellSmith", "display_name": "Daniel O'Donnell-Smith", "profile_url": "https://birbeck.academia.edu/DanielODonnellSmith?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2885491/952273/1192519/s65_daniel.o_donnell-smith.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1, "name": "Creative Writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creative_Writing?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3115, "name": "Posthumanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Posthumanism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3581, "name": "Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poetry?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4696, "name": "Machine Translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Machine_Translation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 6922, "name": "Poetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poetics?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7065, "name": "Ghosts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ghosts?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7513, "name": "Archives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archives?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 11950, "name": "Digital Poetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Poetics?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 12672, "name": "Electronic Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Electronic_Music?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 16972, "name": "Telepresence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Telepresence?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 17760, "name": "Digital Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Arts?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 19109, "name": "Spiritualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spiritualism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 19471, "name": "Contemporary Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Poetry?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 21156, "name": "Soundscape (Music)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soundscape_Music_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 30347, "name": "Translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 32508, "name": "Nineteenth Century Occultism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nineteenth_Century_Occultism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 33431, "name": "Acousmatic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Acousmatic?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 40976, "name": "Telematics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Telematics?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 46307, "name": "W.B.

In describing the processes of cultural hybridization and resistance, I show how difference and mobility are culturally productive and how they can help us understand the important role that artistic research and practice can play in preserving and revitalizing traditional knowledges and cultures in the contemporary globalized world.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53972964, "asset_id": 34031712, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 366825, "first_name": "Mar\u00eda", "last_name": "Posse Emiliani", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "Mar\u00edaPosseEmiliani", "display_name": "Mar\u00eda Posse Emiliani", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/Mar%C3%ADaPosseEmiliani?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/366825/99858/102421703/s65_mar_a.posse_emiliani.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4058, "name": "Ritual", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ritual?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6873, "name": "Caribbean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caribbean_History?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7945, "name": "Caribbean Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caribbean_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 15380, "name": "Contemporary Fiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Fiction?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 19495, "name": "Indigenous Peoples", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Peoples?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 23214, "name": "Documentary Film", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Documentary_Film?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 41201, "name": "Vanuatu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vanuatu?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 191006, "name": "South Pacific", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Pacific?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 207615, "name": "Hybrids", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybrids?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 232176, "name": "Experimental Film and Video", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Experimental_Film_and_Video?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1036270, "name": "History of Vanuatu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Vanuatu?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 33032293, "title": "Egypt in Roman Visual and Material Culture", "created_at": "2017-05-15T20:21:54.435-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33032293/Egypt_in_Roman_Visual_and_Material_Culture?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_33032293", "summary": "This review article addresses current controversies and opportunities in research on the roles, uses, and meanings of \u201cEgypt\u201d in ancient Roman visual and material culture.

For instance, Tom Buchanan, a character in The Great Gatsby, states that \u201c[i]t\u2019s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things\u201d (10). After the wave of immigration was curbed with the Immigration Act of 1924 and reduced to a trickle with the economic downturn of 1929, the nation\u2019s aspirations of empire during the Progressive Era continued to be a source of fears. The imperialistic encroachment into exotic spheres and forceful annexations of the Philippines, Puerto Rica, and Guam enlarged the nation\u2019s contact zones of Oriental otherness and, together with the threat of nonwhite immigration, animated Howard Philips Lovecraft (1890-1937) to describe the consequences of such spatial and ethnic intrusions for America at home. This essay looks at the novella \u201cThe Shadow over Innsmouth\u201d (1936) and argues that its Orientalized representations of otherness, hybridity, and miscegenation work through the depiction of spatial transgressions and the deliberate employment of language.

It is a qualitative research. The researcher substantiates that the novel's characterization, fluid time zones and landscape, the inexplicable metamorphosis, use of mythology and stylistic feature of metafictional writing contends that the novel is not mere fantasy. The Gaze incorporates reality but in an amplified manner which renders it to be magical realism. Shafak's own autobiographical liminal dwelling is interpreted as an unconscious elemental drive to mix the real with the magical in this novel. The research further develops the notion of hybridity by employing attributes of Self and the Other through stylistic and thematic features. The significance of the human gaze is also expounded upon as a tool of magic in the realm of the real. This study depicts how the banal sight of man renders creation and destruction. In this way, the penetrating gaze of humans is denoted as a tool of metafiction which can undo and recreate. Thus, the eyes perform everyday magic because sight precedes existence. Consequently, this research explores the contradictory need to be seen yet to be concealed from sight. Lastly, this study highlights the traumatic influence over one's psyche brought on by the unseen gaze.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61953255, "asset_id": 41806873, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 108747499, "first_name": "Maryam", "last_name": "Raza", "domain_name": "kinnaird", "page_name": "MaryamRaza", "display_name": "Maryam Raza", "profile_url": "https://kinnaird.academia.edu/MaryamRaza?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/108747499/27215472/36966354/s65_maryam.raza.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12558, "name": "Magical Realism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Magical_Realism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20154, "name": "Metafiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Metafiction?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 35686, "name": "Trauma", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trauma?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38125, "name": "Numbers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Numbers?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 189590, "name": "Elif Shafak", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Elif_Shafak?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 986866, "name": "The Gaze", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Gaze?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 26869656, "title": "\u0410\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043a: \u0435\u0436\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043b\u0438\u0434\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0446\u0435\u0432", "created_at": "2016-07-10T03:27:40.196-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26869656/%D0%90%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BA_%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%B2?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_26869656", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47135077, "asset_id": 26869656, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4882956, "first_name": "Rita", "last_name": "Kuznetsova", "domain_name": "kubsu", "page_name": "RitaKuznetsova", "display_name": "Rita Kuznetsova", "profile_url": "https://kubsu.academia.edu/RitaKuznetsova?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4882956/2093320/2461720/s65_rita.kuznetsova.jpg"}, {"id": 4864477, "first_name": "Igor", "last_name": "Kuznetsov", "domain_name": "iling-ran", "page_name": "IgorKuznetsov", "display_name": "Igor Kuznetsov", "profile_url": "https://iling-ran.academia.edu/IgorKuznetsov?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4864477/2086589/2454353/s65_igor.kuznetsov.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8541, "name": "Caucasus", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caucasus?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17208, "name": "Abkhazia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Abkhazia?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 619396, "name": "Anthropology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Religion?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 7872610, "title": "Critiques of Hybridity ", "created_at": "2014-08-04T16:04:50.156-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7872610/Critiques_of_Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_7872610", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34362596, "asset_id": 7872610, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 549811, "first_name": "Thabit", "last_name": "Alomari", "domain_name": "majapasovic", "page_name": "ThabitAlomari", "display_name": "Thabit Alomari", "profile_url": "https://majapasovic.academia.edu/ThabitAlomari?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/549811/198118/29968880/s65_thabit.alomari.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 30373041, "title": "Chapter 13: TOLLAN TEOTIHUACAN: Multiethnic Mosaics, Corporate Interaction, and Social Complexity in Mesoamerica [2017]", "created_at": "2016-12-10T14:41:32.631-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30373041/Chapter_13_TOLLAN_TEOTIHUACAN_Multiethnic_Mosaics_Corporate_Interaction_and_Social_Complexity_in_Mesoamerica_2017_?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_30373041", "summary": "Despite its longstanding preeminence as one of the earliest, largest, and most complex urban centers of highland Mexico, Teotihuacan\u2019s pan-regional impact on Mesoamerica remains the subject of intense debate and conflicting models centering on the rise of social complexity in the American hemisphere. Therefore, this study seeks to address the interplay and operationalization of resource concentration, multiethnic mosaics, and corporate interaction and inter-elite conflict within and beyond the context of the preindustrial metropolis of Teotihuacan. Findings from this review predictably indicate that the ancient highland polity was borne of but one of a host of Late Formative compound chiefdoms situated in the Basin of Mexico, albeit on a semiarid plain that necessitated the formation of an incipient managerial elite devoted to the management of the region\u2019s hydraulic resources. While water management per se may be construed an initial stimulus to the formation of sociopolitical complexity in the highlands, the authors contend that this fact alone did not distinguish Teotihuacan, or for that matter, render it a competitive advantage over other early polities of the region. Its uniqueness, they argue, was borne of (a) its strategic location proximate to both major obsidian deposits and a highland transport network to the Gulf lowlands, (b) a pattern of recurrent demographic restructuring occasioned by the cataclysmic eruptions of Popocat\u00e9petl, Malinche, and Xitle, (c) the formation of multiethnic mosaics and foreign enclaves both within and beyond the metropolis as a result of the two foregoing conditions, and by extension, (d) the emergence of multiethnic corporate groups dedicated to commerce and industry centered on Teotihuacan. In an effort to fully interrogate the extant evidence for the evolution of social complexity in the Basin of Mexico, the authors extend the analysis to those findings bearing on the troubled times of the Late Middle Classic/Epiclassic decline, collapse, and destruction of the ancient metropolis and its far flung outposts. In the final analysis, a review of that evidence bearing on the question of what ultimately became of Teotihuacan in the wake of its disintegration reveals a pattern of escalating internal conflict, militarization, and a balkanization and recapitulation of the constituent multiethnic mosaics that defined the cosmopolitan and multicultural origins of the metropolis from the outset.",

how the construct of non-native English-speaking teachers' (NNESTs) professional identity has evolved in the context of binary logic and power relations. From a socio-historical point of view, colonial origin of English language teaching and native speaker ideology have been identified as prominent discursive influences of NNESTs' professional identity. Although influenced by (post)colonial discourses, research into NNESTs' professional identity is now veering off to a new direction that questions the binary logic and explores experiences beyond the boundary between the native self and the non-native other. This paper argues that nativeness and non-nativeness are not mutually exclusive and objective categories for NNESTs' professional identity. Their identity is rather subject to constant innovation and plasticity. Beyond the critical analysis of the native speaker construct, the paper proposes a professional conceptualisation of a hybrid professional identity of NNESTs in a third space of reflection, enunciation and productive articulation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61245455, "asset_id": 40961122, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 72535655, "first_name": "Nashid", "last_name": "Nigar", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "NNigar", "display_name": "Nashid Nigar", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/NNigar?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/72535655/18579297/29626756/s65_nashid.nigar.jpg"}, {"id": 51552088, "first_name": "Alex", "last_name": "Kostogriz", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "httpmonasheduresearchexploreenpersonsalexanderkostogriza87ea4709f834386b64a35a63be56330html", "display_name": "Alex Kostogriz", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/httpmonasheduresearchexploreenpersonsalexanderkostogriza87ea4709f834386b64a35a63be56330html?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51552088/27397039/57051183/s65_alex.kostogriz.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1007, "name": "Teaching English as a Second Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_as_a_Second_Language?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6590, "name": "Professional Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Professional_Identity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 100573, "name": "Third Space and Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Third_Space_and_Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 153884, "name": "Multilingual Studies, Identity Studies, Border identities, hybridity, multilingualism, poetry, bilingual poetry, cultural studies, postcolonial studies, globalization studies, third culture kids", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingual_Studies_Identity_Studies_Border_identities_hybridity_multilingualism_poetry_bilin?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 161104, "name": "Teacher Professional Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_Professional_Identity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 614081, "name": "TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/TEFL_Teaching_English_as_a_Foreign_Language_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 620077, "name": "English Language Teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Language_Teaching-1?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2299731, "name": "Professional Identity Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Professional_Identity_Development?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 6825366, "title": "The Uniqueness of Christ in a Post-Plural Age", "created_at": "2014-04-21T16:46:51.011-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6825366/The_Uniqueness_of_Christ_in_a_Post_Plural_Age?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_6825366", "summary": "The unfortunate event of the historical intersection of European colonialism and the Christian mission has become problematic for Christian identity in India. While the stark reality of Indian religious plurality has to be adequately addressed, the existing theological responses to religious plurality \u2013 Exclusivism, Inclusivism, and Pluralism - are found to be lacking on either the parameter of establishing the plurality of religions that accounts for parity among religions or the parameter of preserving the particularity of individual religion. \nThe purpose of this thesis is to evaluate and extend the Postliberal/Post-pluralist theological method that employs Lindbeck\u2019s cultural-linguistic theory as an alternative approach that will establish interfaith relations between Christianity and other Indian religions sans the imperialistic notion. The first chapter discusses the cultural-linguistic model which understands religions as resembling languages and semiotic systems, that shape and mold human experiences within the matrix of cultural and linguistic factors. Religions are conceived as \u201ccommunal phenomena,\u201d and attempts are made to understand the concrete expressions of an individual faith community in its liturgy, sacraments, rituals and other forms as decisive for shaping their religious experiences. Thus, Lindbeck successfully identifies religions as multiple instances of linguistic/semiotic systems that are characterized by their internal \u201cforms of life.\u201d Within Lindbeck\u2019s methodology, in his attempt to uphold the particularity of Christianity, his conception of religions as \u201ccomprehensive interpretive schemes\u201d that emphasizes the \u201cuntranslatability\u201d of Christian higher truths into other religious\u2019 idioms is found to be problematic. \nThe second chapter analyses Hans Frei\u2019s narrative reading of the Scripture as an alternative conception to preserve the particularity of Christianity in the person of Christ, whose identity is established through the narrative, \u201chistory-like\u201d depiction of the Gospel stories. This \u201cunsubstitutable\u201d identity of Jesus Christ becomes the \u201cfinal primacy\u201d criterion for all \u201cparticularistic\u201d Christian faith articulations without denying the possibility of other religions\u2019 particular claims. \nFurther, in the third chapter, Lindbeck\u2019s concepts of \u201cincommensurability,\u201d \u201cuntranslatability\u201d are reexamined based on Macintyre\u2019s deflated significance of \u201cincommensurability\u201d and also Homi Bhabha\u2019s conception of Hybridity and Third Space categories. Francis Clooney\u2019s \u201cComparative Dialogue\u201d was reflected upon as a methodical demonstration of initiating interreligious dialogue between the \u201cincomparable\u201d doctrinal/textual traditions, especially between the Uttara Mimamsa Sutras and Summa Theologiae. Such, beyond a post-pluralistic understanding of comparative dialogues that upholds both the plurality and particularity of all religious traditions can be a useful tool in the hands of the Indian Christian community to seek interreligious harmony and in the process regain their Indian identity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58498076, "asset_id": 6825366, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 483504, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Muthukumar S.", "domain_name": "saiacs", "page_name": "DavidMuthukumarS", "display_name": "David Muthukumar S.", "profile_url": "https://saiacs.academia.edu/DavidMuthukumarS?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/483504/3318382/53019766/s65_david.muthukumar_s..jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1302, "name": "Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2561, "name": "Systematic Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Systematic_Theology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6110, "name": "Narrative Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative_Theology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 14375, "name": "Postliberal theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postliberal_theology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 14376, "name": "Hans Frei", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hans_Frei?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 19690, "name": "George Lindbeck", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/George_Lindbeck?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 31713, "name": "Interfaith Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interfaith_Theology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 31714, "name": "Comparative Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Theology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 38097, "name": "Interfaith Dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interfaith_Dialogue?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 63940, "name": "Incommensurability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Incommensurability?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 125247, "name": "Cultural linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_linguistics?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 153006, "name": "Narrative Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative_Identity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 474028, "name": "Religious Plurality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Plurality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 615879, "name": "Hinduism and Christianity in India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hinduism_and_Christianity_in_India?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 841542, "name": "Hindu-Christian Dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hindu-Christian_Dialogue?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1365520, "name": "Uniqueness of Christ", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Uniqueness_of_Christ?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3144441, "name": "Postplural Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postplural_Theology?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 34246610, "title": "A Critical Analysis of the Nollywood Film Osuofia in London", "created_at": "2017-08-16T13:26:37.339-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34246610/A_Critical_Analysis_of_the_Nollywood_Film_Osuofia_in_London?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_34246610", "summary": "This article analyzes Nigeria\u2019s Nollywood film Osuofia in London [Ogoro, K.

This, in turn, provides them with the opportunity to develop their creative processes. It is shown that artists\u2019-in-residence openness and willingness to travel internationally is, on the one hand, related to the development of information technology, and on the other, supported by travelling facilities, which have impact on lifelong learning and cultural maintenance. Whereas change of geographical environment is often associated to psychological and physical conditions, artists\u2019 statements reveal the dichotomy and paradox between globalization, collaboration and dispersion versus isolation, individualism and concentration. Possibilities for documenting and circulating artworks through digital communication tools and in-situ supply support and generate knowledge and recognition. All these possibilities, however, are challenged by uncertainty. The acknowledgment of cultural differences and barriers is expressed by artists in the most varied ways, especially through performance art and site-specific installations. As a source of inspiration, cross-cultural environments are negotiated by artists\u2019 hybrid identities, situated at the intersection of Western and Non-Western aesthetic traditions.

Only during those crazy times can one look at what is otherwise hidden.

The worldwide reception of Lees' films gives rise to the question as to what extent Bachtin's carnival as a result of literary transgressions also contributes to the softening of cultural boundaries trough Lee's cinematographic work. However, while Bachtin concluded the design of a counterculture with the carnival of high cultures, Lee's stagings of others portray rather opposing worlds that are to be located beyond conventional concepts of culture: That is when East and West finally finished meeting each other to become a transcultural heirtage.

The aim of this volume is to form a critical assessment of the scope, significance and role of the notion in literature and the visual arts from the eighteenth century to the present day. The contributors propose to examine the development and various manifestations of the concept as a principle held in contempt by the partisans of racial purity, a process enthusiastically promoted by adepts of mixing and syncretism, but also a notion viewed with suspicion by those who decry its multifarious and triumphalist dimensions and its lack of political roots. The notion of hybridity is analysed in relation to the concepts of identity, nationhood, language and culture, drawing from the theories of Mikhail Bakhtin, Homi Bhabha, Robert Young, Paul Gilroy and Edouard Glissant, among others. Contributors examine forms of hybridity in the work of such canonical writers as Daniel Defoe, Robert Louis Stevenson, Thomas De Quincey and Victor Hugo, as well as in contemporary American and British fiction, Neo-Victorian and post-colonial literature.

It identifies uses of imperial language in the Book of Revelation and describes the book\u2019s relationship to the Roman Empire as one of entanglement rather than opposition. This leads to an exploration of Revelation using the post-colonial hermeneutical concepts catachresis, mimicry, and hybridity. The Apocalypse reflects a hybrid Roman colonial location that imitates imperial discourse in paradoxical ways in order to promote political resistance and to exhort its audience to faithfulness.

What is significant in the literary text is Rushdie\u2019s ability to fictionalise history, fantasize his depiction of historical reality and combine history with politics through the portrayal of the individual, Saleem Sinai the narrator, in relation to the larger historical context that fashions the Indian society.

"work_44349607", "summary": "This dissertation examines how late nineteenth-century discourse on tuning and temperament was co-produced with the global politics of nationalism, transnationalism, colonialism, and imperialism.  I concentrate on the history of \u201cjust intonation\u201d\u2014a tuning system whose intervallic proportions are predicated on the logic of simple whole-integer ratios\u2014as it was theorized by a network of musical scholars spanning Asia, Europe, and North America.  My focus on this history reveals how, on the one hand, political forces shaped the development of comparative musicology and methods of score-based analysis.  I also demonstrate, on the other, how the increasing entanglements between \u201cWestern\u201d and \u201cnon-Western\u201d scholarship produced new expressions of cultural hybridity that fundamentally reconfigured national politics, through the reciprocal exchange of musical ideas and instruments.  Based on my findings, I challenge persistent myths of theoretical autonomy and cultural exceptionalism, and assess both the merits and pitfalls of attempting to write a global history of music theory.\nIn four chapters, I examine three branches of just-intonation discourse and evaluate their connections to the political relations between indigenous\u2014settler populations (Native American communities/United States), colonizer\u2014colonized groups (England/India), and nation-states pursuing diplomatic relations (Germany/Japan).  Drawing on the methods of Science, Technology, and Society Studies (STS), I lay out how the epistemological frameworks of scholarship within these contexts drew upon statistical techniques, myths of cultural origins, and theories of nature that were integral to the formation of nineteenth-century nation-states and imperial regimes.  I argue that the construction of just-intonation keyboards with as many as fifty-three tones per octave played a particularly important role within this context, as tools for scientific investigation as well as for normalizing and standardizing national musical practices.

This is the transition that we shall label \"negative anagnorisis\" and, following the model of Aristotle, we shall use it to denote a transition from knowledge to a lack of knowledge. We defined the first negation, using Freud\u2019s theoretical framework, as negation-repetition. Its clear-cut mark is the erasure of the difference in relation to the opposite. While negating itself, it, in fact, repeats itself. The second mode of negation was defined through Adorno\u2019s propositions \u2013 as negation, rupturing the repetition. The negation-repetition succeeds to materialize itself into a singular object of negation. With Adorno this type of negation will be a material rupture of the event, the moment in Kafka\u2019s prose when the train (the object) is launched into the social. These two types of negation \u2013 negation-repetition and negation-rupture of the repetition \u2013 work out and form together a third mode of negation: negation-metamorphosis or the means by which the metamorphosis becomes a series of ruptures. \nIn this sense, the metamorphosis in Kafka\u2019s story is not the initial alteration but the synchronization of the focal point and the background in the process of negative anagnorisis, viewed as rupture and gradation in the continuum of negation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52845817, "asset_id": 32680028, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2694249, "first_name": "Kamelia", "last_name": "Spassova", "domain_name": "uni-sofia", "page_name": "KameliaSpassova", "display_name": "Kamelia  Spassova", "profile_url": "https://uni-sofia.academia.edu/KameliaSpassova?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2694249/863424/15956450/s65_kamelia.spassova.jpg"}, {"id": 6273397, "first_name": "Maria", "last_name": "Kalinova", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MariaKalinova", "display_name": "Maria Kalinova", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MariaKalinova?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6273397/3795105/4442107/s65_maria.kalinova.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3511, "name": "Theodor Adorno", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theodor_Adorno?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8446, "name": "Franz Kafka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Franz_Kafka?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8487, "name": "Sigmund Freud", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sigmund_Freud?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 57413, "name": "Singularity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singularity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 101239, "name": "Negation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Negation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 121551, "name": "Repetition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Repetition?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 167056, "name": "Metamorphosis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Metamorphosis?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 227030, "name": "Ovid Metamorphoses", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ovid_Metamorphoses?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 531177, "name": "Focalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Focalization?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 686871, "name": "Temporality and rupture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Temporality_and_rupture?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1036039, "name": "Focal Point", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Focal_Point?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1238257, "name": "Anagnorisis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anagnorisis?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1669570, "name": "Die Verwandlung", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Die_Verwandlung?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 12233071, "title": "\u201cHeretofore Considered Legendary:\u201d The Harpy of 1784 and Meanings of Monstrosity in Eighteenth-Century France", "created_at": "2015-05-04T16:01:49.917-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12233071/_Heretofore_Considered_Legendary_The_Harpy_of_1784_and_Meanings_of_Monstrosity_in_Eighteenth_Century_France?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_12233071", "summary": "Since Antiquity, monsters and monstrosities have served as vehicles for cultural, philosophical, and scientific debates.

Furthermore, she was the first Canadian rapper to gain acknowledgement and support from established New York hip-hop acts such as Boogie Down Productions (BDP). Michie Mee was also the first Canadian rapper signed to an American record label (First Priority Music).

Animals facilitate communication between the lovers whilst ensuring the secrecy of their relationship, but also symbolize the transgression of social laws in favour of the courtly ideal. However, in some texts of the same period, animals are no longer the adjuvants of lovers, instead they are placed within the couple. This is the case of the Knight from the Lai du Bisclavret by Marie de France (twelfth century) who metamorphoses into a werewolf, and the Guivre \u2013 a dragon maiden \u2013 from the Bel Inconnu by Renaut de Beaujeu (thirteenth century).\nBy their hybridity, these two creatures transgress the species borders. This peculiarity could allow us to consider these beasts in their \u201cqueerness\u201d in every sense of the word. Belonging to the medieval marvel, they are what disturbs the norm. They invite us to question the boundaries between human and animal as well as they help us to understand alterity. This alterity is present through an unnatural love relationship that arises by the presence of the Guivre or the werewolf. Thenceforth, \u201cqueerness\u201d could be understood as its most common meaning to the extent that these monsters break the canonical model of the man-woman couple. More than proposing a homoeroticism reading of these texts, we aim essentially to question heteronormativity and to point out the possibilities of varied love relationships. Finally, these two texts allow us also to interrogate masculinity through the werewolf and femininity through the Guivre, without forgetting the human partner confronted to this marvel. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67373073, "asset_id": 48982892, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 67373082, "asset_id": 48982892, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2519125, "first_name": "Leticia", "last_name": "Ding", "domain_name": "unil", "page_name": "LeticiaDing", "display_name": "Leticia Ding", "profile_url": "https://unil.academia.edu/LeticiaDing?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2519125/785369/1029483/s65_leticia.ding.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 699, "name": "Queer Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2853, "name": "Medieval Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 84419, "name": "Arthurian Romances", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arthurian_Romances?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 93987, "name": "Marie De France", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marie_De_France?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 360180, "name": "Arthurian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arthurian_Literature?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2789477, "name": "animal turn", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/animal_turn?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 4081187, "title": "The Missing Link_ Transculturation, Hybridity and or Transculturality ", "created_at": "2013-07-22T05:51:42.164-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4081187/The_Missing_Link_Transculturation_Hybridity_and_or_Transculturality?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_4081187", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31607602, "asset_id": 4081187, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 136040, "first_name": "Sissy", "last_name": "Helff", "domain_name": "uni-frankfurt", "page_name": "SissyHelff", "display_name": "Sissy Helff", "profile_url": "https://uni-frankfurt.academia.edu/SissyHelff?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/136040/2675676/10484279/s65_sissy.helff.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11213, "name": "Transculturation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transculturation?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 58998, "name": "Transcultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transcultural_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115554, "name": "Shani Mootoo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shani_Mootoo?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36214476, "title": "Hybridity on the Ground in Peacebuilding and Development: Critical Conversations", "created_at": "2018-03-20T21:19:21.811-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36214476/Hybridity_on_the_Ground_in_Peacebuilding_and_Development_Critical_Conversations?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_36214476", "summary": "Hybridity on the Ground in Peacebuilding and Development engages with the possibilities and pitfalls of the increasingly popular notion of hybridity. The hybridity concept has been embraced by scholars and practitioners in response to the social and institutional complexities of peacebuilding and development practice. In particular, the concept appears well-suited to making sense of the mutually constitutive outcomes of processes of interaction between diverse norms, institutions, actors and discourses in the context of contemporary peacebuilding and development engagements. At the same time, it has been criticised from a variety of perspectives for overlooking critical questions of history, power and scale. The authors in this interdisciplinary collection draw on their in\u2011depth knowledge of peacebuilding and development contexts in different parts of Asia, the Pacific and Africa to examine the messy and dynamic realities of hybridity \u2018on the ground\u2019. By critically exploring the power dynamics, and the diverse actors, ideas, practices and sites that shape hybrid peacebuilding and development across time and space, this book offers fresh insights to hybridity debates that will be of interest to both scholars and practitioners.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56116473, "asset_id": 36214476, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

This study examines imagery and symbolism on a Colonial Inka painted wooden kero that portrays a ceremonial battle scene on one side, and a scene derived from a European print on the other. Despite the fact that the printed scene is contrary to certain aspects of Andean beliefs, the scene was incorporated into the vessel's decoration and modified to portray Andean symbolic content and the status of the vessel's owner. Taken together, the imagery on both sides convey important Andean cosmological themes. The probable owner of the kero was a kuraka, an indigenous noble who acted as an intermediary between Spanish colonizers and colonized Andean subjects. Kurakas commissioned objects such as painted keros that were not passive byproducts of hybrid colonized identities, but rather sent deliberate messages that conveyed power, prestige, and adherence to tradition to Spanish and Andean viewers alike.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60487180, "asset_id": 40253452, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11719510, "first_name": "Andrew", "last_name": "Turner", "domain_name": "getty", "page_name": "AndrewTurner", "display_name": "Andrew D Turner", "profile_url": "https://getty.academia.edu/AndrewTurner?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11719510/3377839/3974773/s65_andrew.turner.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 388, "name": "Latin American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1250, "name": "Latin American and Caribbean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_and_Caribbean_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3840, "name": "Latin American Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Art?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 22318, "name": "Peruvian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peruvian_History?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 28694, "name": "Inca Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Inca_Archaeology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 28695, "name": "Spanish Colonial Peru", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spanish_Colonial_Peru?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 45246, "name": "Colonial Latin American History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Latin_American_History?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 53034, "name": "Cultural hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 53189, "name": "Colonial Latin American Art- Mexico and Peru", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Latin_American_Art-_Mexico_and_Peru?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 93379, "name": "Incas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Incas?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 93402, "name": "Inkas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Inkas?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 164867, "name": "Spanish Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spanish_Colonialism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 247250, "name": "Arqueolog\u00eda Inka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arqueologia_Inka?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 490984, "name": "Arte Colonial Americano", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arte_Colonial_Americano?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1282961, "name": "Ancient and Colonial Andean Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_and_Colonial_Andean_Religion?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 15368529, "title": "Stuart Hall: \"Pensando en la di\u00e1spora: en casa, desde el extranjero\" (trad.

De hecho, en el Nuevo Mundo y en particular en el Caribe, el tropo b\u00edblico del \u00e9xodo, la liberaci\u00f3n de la esclavitud y el regreso a la Tierra Prometida, ha sido un modelo de afirmaci\u00f3n de identidades (hegem\u00f3nicas y contra-hegem\u00f3nicas). Pero la \u201cescena primaria\u201d no s\u00f3lo del Nuevo Mundo\u2014sino de la identidad\u2014es la del desplazamiento, el desarraigo, la reinvenci\u00f3n; no es una ontolog\u00eda sino un continuo devenir. El exilio es una instancia de crisis que no puede solucionarse con el mero retorno. En la situaci\u00f3n de di\u00e1spora, las identidades irremediablemente se multiplican y forman en la diseminaci\u00f3n, transculturaci\u00f3n e hibridez, tanto del cuerpo como del sentido. Mediante el an\u00e1lisis de la reinvenci\u00f3n de \u201c\u00c1frica,\u201d del Caribe y de lo antillano diasp\u00f3rico en la producci\u00f3n cultural urbana de las comunidades de inmigrantes antillanos en Inglaterra (i.e.: la m\u00fasica y la subcultura del dancehall en Londres), Hall propone una noci\u00f3n de identidad que, sin caer en el fundamentalismo de los or\u00edgenes, la pureza y el regreso, vincula la memoria y la tradici\u00f3n a formas contra-hegem\u00f3nicas de resolver los traumas y desarraigos que el imperialismo nos leg\u00f3. La condici\u00f3n \u201cafricana\u201d del Caribe parece singular\u2014por lo tr\u00e1gica y violenta\u2014pero en realidad expresa la condici\u00f3n inexorablemente impura de la identidad: \u201csiempre hay un \u2018deslizamiento\u2019 o \u2018fuga\u2019 del significado en la amplia semiosis de las pr\u00e1cticas culturales de significaci\u00f3n\u201d, incorporaci\u00f3n creativa, reapropiaci\u00f3n dial\u00f3gica, y traducci\u00f3n.

\u00fanica, de frui\u00e7\u00e3o duplamente privada e p\u00fablica, funcional e est\u00e9tica, racional e emotiva, que permite uma interessante abordagem do ponto de vista da psicologia da habita\u00e7\u00e3o e da afirma\u00e7\u00e3o da resid\u00eancia enquanto obra de express\u00e3o cultural e social, ultrapassando claramente o pr\u00f3prio conceito modernista de obra

This movement gained strength after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear power plant accident, when several Buddhist organizations publicly expressed their disapproval of nuclear energy. This article argues that rather than a timeless \u201cgreen Dharma\u201d inherently close to nature, contemporary Japanese Buddhism is a \u201cgreening Dharma\u201d that is gradually becoming engaged in environmentalism for different reasons. Although the presence of sincere religious concern and a doctrinal anchorage cannot be overlooked, a crucial role is played by Japanese Buddhism\u2019s need to reassert its presence in the public

Greek Urban Popular Music\u2013 during the interwar period. The aim of the research is to show the hybrid character of Rebetiko through the analysis of the confrontation between the makam modality and an idiosyncratic form of chordal harmony, transcending the typical East-West dipole.\n\nAfter having listened to a large corpus of gramophone recordings of that period, I chose some of the most representative musical pieces \u2013in terms of harmonization and modality\u2013 in order, firstly, to document them in transcriptions and, secondly, to analyze and interpret them within their socio-cultural context.\n\nThe establishment of the equal tempered three-course bouzouki and the censorship by Metaxas\u2019 regime are peculiar forms of modernization and westernization respectively, which contributed to the hybrid aspects of this genre. The interplay between the Greek and the other ethnic communities within the eastern Mediterranean context, the deterritorialization of the musical culture from the broader area of Anatolia to the Greek state due to the Greek refugee movement (1922-23) are some of the basic factors which facilitate the understanding of the cultural osmosis responsible for this musical syncretism.\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65735038, "asset_id": 45158090, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10779537, "first_name": "Spiros", "last_name": "Delegos", "domain_name": "uniarts", "page_name": "SpirosDelegos", "display_name": "Spiros Delegos", "profile_url": "https://uniarts.academia.edu/SpirosDelegos?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10779537/12689526/36985151/s65_spiros.delegos.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9213, "name": "Modality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modality?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 85618, "name": "Theory of Harmony", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theory_of_Harmony?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 170697, "name": "Musical Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Musical_Analysis?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 505378, "name": "Makam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Makam?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 671813, "name": "Rebetiko", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rebetiko?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 895789, "name": "Harmonisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Harmonisation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1079977, "name": "Greek Urban Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Greek_Urban_Music?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 36609964, "title": "Intangible Cultural Heritage Beyond Borders: Egyptian Bellydance (Raqs Sharqi) as a Form of Transcultural Heritage", "created_at": "2018-05-11T03:52:40.423-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36609964/Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Beyond_Borders_Egyptian_Bellydance_Raqs_Sharqi_as_a_Form_of_Transcultural_Heritage?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_36609964", "summary": "The 2003 UNESCO Convention on Intangible Cultural Heritage\nhighlights the importance of safeguarding traditional practices.\nWhile some of these practices are only performed in their place of\norigin, others (such as yoga and flamenco) take place worldwide.\nIn this paper we explore what happens when a form of ICH that\noriginated in one place becomes global.

The rise of the British novel paralleled the rise of the nineteenth century British Empire. The novel became an effective means to transmit the culture of the state to the outlying territories and over the course of the 20th century, the colonies of began writing back. This paper examines two colonial era novels (Charlotte Bronte\u2019s Jane Eyre and Rudyard Kipling\u2019s Kim), two colonial self reflexive novels (Joseph Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness and E.M. Forster\u2019s A Passage to India), and two post-colonial responses (Jean Rhys\u2019s Wide Sargasso Sea and Tayeb Salih\u2019s Season of Migration to the North). By comparing these six novels and time periods to each other, patterns emerge which show the destructive impact of colonizing cultures as well as a trend of injustice. There are also patterns which show the possibility of an alternative narrative which is found through interpreting opposing cultural forces simultaneously. These analyses are informed by Edward Said\u2019s Culture and Imperialism. He proposes a theory of narrative liberation which is the process of constant re-writing.  For the post-colonial responses, it is not enough to react to the colonizing works with linear narratives of emancipation.  These post-colonial responses use cutting prose, montage, and fragmented story structure to tell the colonizing experience with their own voice.  However, it is not exclusive and does not aim to create another marginalized group. History and culture is a series of overlapping territories and shared heritage, and the process of liberation is a process of creating co-authorship and the search for finding one\u2019s authentic voice.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37461087, "asset_id": 12157197, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8494262, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "White", "domain_name": "aauni", "page_name": "JohnWhite", "display_name": "John  White", "profile_url": "https://aauni.academia.edu/JohnWhite?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8494262/8868341/9899215/s65_john.white.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6790, "name": "Conrad, Joseph", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conrad_Joseph?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29161, "name": "Jean Rhys", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jean_Rhys?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 32005, "name": "Edward Said", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Edward_Said?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 32009, "name": "Tayeb Salih", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tayeb_Salih?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 39559, "name": "Rudyard Kipling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rudyard_Kipling?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 45650, "name": "Joseph Conrad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Joseph_Conrad?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 171121, "name": "Jane Eyre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jane_Eyre?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 482018, "name": "Franz Fanon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Franz_Fanon?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 664772, "name": "E.

After his exile from Iran in 2008, Namjoo has positioned himself on the global scene, pursuing a musical project of innovation, nonconformity, and resistance. Despite Namjoo's important role as social critic, artistic innovator, and as mediator of contemporary Iranian experience, very few studies have ventured beyond the surface levels of his expression. This paper first locates Mohsen Namjoo and his works in context and examines how his art aligns at a hybrid in-between state. The second part studies Namjoo's expression as a multileveled system, or poetics, of hybridity through the lens of general, and specifically post-colonial, conceptualizations of hybridity. The analysis of Namjoo's hybrid artwork, as method and outcome, informs us of an expression operating within three main oppositions: new/old, foreign/local, and uncanny/familiar. The study concludes that the effectiveness of Namjoo's voice can be traced to the craft of hybridization itself; through modes of adaptation, appropriation, relocation, mimicry, and ambiguity, Namjoo disrupts and unsettles both sociocultural norms and state discourse.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57377677, "asset_id": 37408880, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 481039, "first_name": "Anders", "last_name": "Widmark", "domain_name": "uppsala", "page_name": "AndersWidmark", "display_name": "Anders Widmark", "profile_url": "https://uppsala.academia.edu/AndersWidmark?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/481039/162495/20127164/s65_anders.widmark.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 687, "name": "Musicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Musicology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3581, "name": "Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poetry?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5218, "name": "Iranian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iranian_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 10444, "name": "Postmodernism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postmodernism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 35356, "name": "Persian", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persian?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 63265, "name": "\u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 581882, "name": "Mohsen Namjoo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mohsen_Namjoo?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1461948, "name": "\u062a\u0644\u0641\u06cc\u0642", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%81%DB%8C%D9%82?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3022721, "name": "\u0645\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0646\u0627\u0645\u062c\u0648", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%86_%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%88?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 16322881, "title": "Inquiring into Human Enhancement - Interdisciplinary and International Perspectives", "created_at": "2015-09-30T06:48:38.152-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/16322881/Inquiring_into_Human_Enhancement_Interdisciplinary_and_International_Perspectives?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_16322881", "summary": "What is human enhancement all about?

Rift scholars have further argued that \u201csecond-stage\u201d ecosocialists should push back against \u201cidealist\u201d deviations occurring amongst historical materialists concerned with the production of nature, socionatures and \u201chybridity,\u201d as well as more or less all engagements with literatures on eco-technological transitions, industrial ecology and the like, which are implicated in supporting \u201cgreen capitalism.\u201d This paper critically evaluates these claims. In each case, it is argued, rift scholarship is narrowing the possibilities for interdisciplinary engagement and for thinking in dynamic and reconstructive terms about red-green futures. It is our sense that an ecosocialist vision of just transitions has to be conceptualized as a diverse, dynamic, iterative and always incomplete affair. Anthropocene ecosocialisms are inevitably going to involve co-producing, making and remaking hybrid social ecologies on an irreducibly restless, turbulent and warming planet. We argue that what follows from this is the necessity to both critique and recuperate the better insights of hybrid political ecology and ecological modernities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51997229, "asset_id": 31676392, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 923240, "first_name": "Damian", "last_name": "White", "domain_name": "risd", "page_name": "DamianWhite", "display_name": "Damian White", "profile_url": "https://risd.academia.edu/DamianWhite?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/923240/345171/986955/s65_damian.white.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 190, "name": "Environmental Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Sociology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 201, "name": "Political Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Sociology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 802, "name": "Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Economy?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1696, "name": "Political Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1698, "name": "Marxism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marxism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3126, "name": "Political Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Ecology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3407, "name": "Environmental Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 9846, "name": "Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 18303, "name": "Historical Materialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Materialism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 18845, "name": "Environmental Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Sustainability?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 23931, "name": "Political Ecology (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Ecology_Anthropology_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 25406, "name": "Production of Nature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Production_of_Nature?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 39738, "name": "Anthropocene studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropocene_studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 51591, "name": "Feminist Political Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminist_Political_Ecology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 120361, "name": "Metabolic Rift", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Metabolic_Rift?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 149474, "name": "Anthropocene", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropocene?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 445818, "name": "Ecosocialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecosocialism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 619518, "name": "The Anthropocentric Nature of the Social Science Discipline", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Anthropocentric_Nature_of_the_Social_Science_Discipline?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 998955, "name": "Political Ecology and Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Ecology_and_Economy?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1208617, "name": "Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainability?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1883731, "name": "Alienation, Ecological Marxism, Metabolic Rift, Metabolism, and Alienation, Ecological Marxism, Metabolic Rift, Metabolism, and Treadmill of Production", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alienation_Ecological_Marxism_Metabolic_Rift_Metabolism_and_Alienation_Ecological_Marxism_Meta?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 38776910, "title": "Alienated Hybrid Children in Korea During the 1950s", "created_at": "2019-04-11T10:35:46.011-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38776910/Alienated_Hybrid_Children_in_Korea_During_the_1950s?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_38776910", "summary": "This research analyzed the process of emergence of mixed-blood children in Korea during the 1950s. It was conducted with the two main objectives: 1) to investigate the process of the hybridization of mixed-blood children in Korea during the 1950s and the factors triggered their emergence, and 2) to see how the concept of hybridity explain the existence of honhyeol in Korea during the 1950s as the contraposition of the idea of danil minjok. This research was conducted by analyzing the news articles from Chosun Ilbo, Dong-a Ilbo, and Kyunghyang Shinmun between January 1, 1950, and December 31, 1959 and reviewing the previous studies. In order to understand the process of emergence of mixed-blood children in this period, the concept of hybridity which covers the scope of racial and cultures is used, which is in contrast with the blood purity consciousness that is believed by Koreans for a long time. Through this research, it was found that the 1950s were the period of the emerging nature of mixed-blood children as its numbers increased almost every year from hundreds to more than one thousand at the end of the 1950s. Moreover, it was found that the racial hybridity of mixed-blood children in Korea during the 1950s was more like a system that did not only deal with the relationship between G.I. soldiers and yanggongju. This process also involved the surrounding factors such as the dream of yanggongju about American luxury; the tacit government supports towards kijichon; and the U.S. military service that did not oppose the presence of kijichon. In the end, the public and Korean government that was not ready yet to deal with the existence of mixed-blood children built a barrier as a defense to maintain the blood purity consciousness and put these children as the \u2018alien in the homeland.\u2019", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58866286, "asset_id": 38776910, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28971626, "first_name": "Ashanti", "last_name": "Widyana", "domain_name": "upi-edu", "page_name": "AshantiWidyana", "display_name": "Ashanti Widyana", "profile_url": "https://upi-edu.academia.edu/AshantiWidyana?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28971626/8244175/21736788/s65_ashanti.widyana.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3902, "name": "Korean Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Korean_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 62640, "name": "Postcolonial Theory/Subaltern Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Theory_Subaltern_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 80848, "name": "Mixed Race Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mixed_Race_Identity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 127409, "name": "Korean popular culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Korean_popular_culture?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 28004840, "title": "\"Domesticating Hybridity: Straits Chinese Cultural Heritage Projects in Malaysia and Singapore\"", "created_at": "2016-08-25T10:45:08.843-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28004840/_Domesticating_Hybridity_Straits_Chinese_Cultural_Heritage_Projects_in_Malaysia_and_Singapore_?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_28004840", "summary": "This article examines the literal and figurative domestication of Straits Chinese, or Peranakan, history in selected heritage projects in late twentieth-century Malaysia and Singapore. These projects simultaneously foreground Straits Chinese history as a symbol of interracial harmony and marginalize it as a cultural artifact. Over the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the ethnoculturally hybrid Straits Chinese positioned themselves as \u201cthe King\u2019s Chinese,\u201d champions of a Confucian-values renaissance, and citizens of independent Malaysia and Singapore. Their adaptability helped them survive the upheaval of imperialism, decolonization, and nation building, but it was also controversial for its suggestion of political flexibility. Today, Southeast Asian governments and the Peranakan themselves depict the community as a uniquely local model of ethnic integration. Museums and historic homes emphasize portrayals and consumption of supposedly feminine aspects of Peranakan culture (e.g., fashion and cuisine), while downplaying purportedly masculine elements (e.g., the possession of multiple nationalities). By conflating femininity, tradition, and racial hybridity, this approach reifies stereotypes about gender and cultural identity, and replaces transgressive potential with politically anodyne nostalgia and commercialization. As anxieties about race, national history, and belonging continue to undergird the modern polity, transnationalism and transculturalism are acceptable as long as they are confined to the past.",

a.k.a. \u2018Modern Hebrew\u2019), the language which emerged in Eretz Israel at the end of the nineteenth century, possesses distinctive socio-historical characteristics such as the lack of a continuous chain of native speakers from spoken Hebrew to Israeli, the non-Semitic mother tongues spoken by the revivalists, and the European impact on literary Hebrew. Consequently, it presents the linguist with a unique laboratory in which to examine a wider set of theoretical problems concerning language genesis, social issues like language and politics, and practical matters, e.g. whether it is possible to revive a no-longer spoken language. The multisourced nature of Israeli and the role of the Congruence Principle and the Founder Principle in its genesis have implications for historical linguistics, language planning and the study of language, culture and identity.\r\n\r\nHebrew was spoken since approximately the fourteenth century BCE. It belonged to the Canaanite division of the north-western branch of the Semitic languages, all of which belong to the Afro-Asiatic family. Following a gradual decline, it ceased to be spoken BY the second century CE. The failed Bar-Kokhba Revolt against the Romans in Judea in CE 132-5 marks the symbolic end of the period of spoken Hebrew. Jesus, for example, was a native speaker of Aramaic rather than Hebrew. For approximately 1750 years thereafter, Hebrew was not spoken. A most important liturgical and literary language, it occasionally served as a lingua franca for Jews of the Diaspora, but not as a mother tongue.\r\n\r\nAlthough language is an abstract emsemble of idiolects, sociolects, dialects etc., linguists often generalize about communal languages. In fact, the genetic classification of Israeli has preoccupied linguists since its genesis. The still prevalent, traditional view suggests that Israeli is Semitic: (Biblical/Mishnaic) Hebrew revived. The revisionist position defines Israeli as Indo-European: Yiddish relexified, i.e. Yiddish, the \u2018revivalists\u2019\u2019 mother tongue, is the \u2018substratum\u2019, whilst Hebrew is only a \u2018superstratum\u2019 providing the vocabulary (cf. Horvath & Wexler 1997). According to my own mosaic (rather than Mosaic) model, \u2018genetically modified\u2019 Israeli is a \u2018semi-engineered\u2019 multi-layered language, which is a Semito-European, or Eurasian, hybrid, i.e. Israeli is both Semitic (Afro-Asiatic) and (Indo-)European. It is based simultaneously on \u2018sleeping beauty\u2019/\u2019walking dead\u2019 Hebrew, \u2018m\u00e1me l\u00f3shn\u2019 (\u2018mother tongue\u2019) Yiddish (both being primary contributors) and many other languages spoken by revivalists, e.g. Russian, Polish, Ladino (Judeo-Spanish) and Arabic. Therefore, the term \u2018Israeli\u2019 is far more appropriate than \u2018Israeli Hebrew\u2019, let alone \u2018Modern Hebrew\u2019 or \u2018Hebrew\u2019 tout court. Israeli is not a case of retsakh yidish (Israeli for \"murder of Yiddish\") but rather of yidish redt zikh (Yiddish for \"Yiddish speaks itself [beneath Israeli]\"). \r\n\r\nAlmost all \u2018revivalists\u2019 \u2013 e.g. the symbolic father of Israeli, Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, born Perelman \u2013 were native Yiddish-speakers who wanted to speak Hebrew, with Semitic grammar and pronunciation, like Arabs. Not only were they European but their revivalist campaign was inspired by European \u2013 e.g. Bulgarian \u2013 nationalism. At the time, although territory and language were at the heart of European nationalism, the Jews possessed neither a national territory nor a national language. Zionism could be considered a fascinating manifestation of European discourses channelled into the Holy Land - cf. George Eliot\u2019s Daniel Deronda (1876).\r\n\r\nHowever, the \u2018revivalists\u2019 attempts (1) to deny their (more recent) roots in search of Biblical ancientness, (2) negate diasporism and disown the 'weak, persecuted' exilic Jew, and (3) avoid hybridity (as reflected in Slavonized, Romance/Semitic-influenced, Germanic Yiddish itself, which they despised) failed. Although they have engaged in a campaign for linguistic purity, the emerging Israeli language often mirrors the very components the revivalists sought to erase. Thus, the study of Israeli casts light on the dynamics between language and culture in general, and in particular into the role of language as a source of collective self-perception.\r\n \r\n\r\nABOUT THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK\r\n\r\nGhil'ad ZUCKERMANN, D.Phil. (Oxford), Ph.D. (Cambridge) (titular), M.A. (Tel Aviv) (summa cum laude), is Associate Professor and Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Fellow at The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia (a.k.a. \u2018Lucky Country\u2019).

From my perspective it is good that there should be a basic distinction between Hebrew and Israeli. Perhaps this is what will bridge the ideological gap between my own language and the institutional language.\u201d (Nissan Shor, Time Out Tel Aviv, 29 January 2009)\r\n\r\n\u201cFascinating, refreshing, horizon-broadening, amusing, amused\u2026liberal, radical\u201d (Prof. Fania Oz-Salzberger, Book Launch, Haifa Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que, Haifa, 28 January 2009)\r\n \u201cProvocative\u201d (Hanoch Marmari, Time Out Tel Aviv, 29 January 2009)\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is obvious that Prof. Zuckermann loves languages and loves playing with languages\u201d (Prof. Tamar Katriel, Book Launch, Haifa Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que, Haifa, 28 January 2009)\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2018MINIMAL PAIRS\u2019\r\n\r\n(1) \u201cThis book calls for in-depth discussion\u201d (Noam Ordan, Haaretz, 24 December 2008) \r\n\r\nVersus \u201c\u00c9ser sh\u00e9kel (\u201cten shekels\u201d, common but violating the Academy of Hebrew Language rules) is talking out of your arse!\u201d (Politician Yossi Sarid, Haaretz, 28 December 2008)\r\n\r\n(2) \u201cZuckermann is brilliant and erudite, and he raises important issues\u201d (Ruvik Rosenthal, HaZira HaLeshonit (Linguistic Arena), NRG Maariv, 18 December 2008)\r\n\r\nVersus \u201cThis long-haired, jumpy professor is honouring us with a visit to the motherland\u201d (Benny Zipper, Haaretz Online, 19 December 2008) \r\n\r\n(3) \u201cWhat amazed me about the response was that knowing absolutely nothing about the book did not stop people from disagreeing with it \u2013 and vehemently at that.\u201d (Noam Ordan, Haaretz, 24 December 2008)\r\n\r\nVersus \u201cIt is about time, really, that scholars should return to the ivory tower from which they came\u201d (Benny Zipper, Haaretz Online, 19 December 2008)\r\n\r\n(4) \u201cYiddish is the passion of the young and brilliant linguist Ghil\u2018ad Zuckermann\u2026 The large inventory of examples that he puts forth, classifies and names\u2026is definitely worth listening to and learning from.\u201d (Yitzhak Laor, Haaretz, 9 January 2009)\r\n\r\nVersus \u201cConvincing, cute, harmful\u201d, \u201cAn interesting but annoying book\u201d (Hagai Hitron, Haaretz, 24 December 2008) \r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION OF EXCERPTS FROM A RECENT ARTICLE ON ZUCKERMANN BY THE FAMOUS SOCIOLINGUIST PROF. JOSHUA FISHMAN\r\n\r\n...As Zuckerman says it in his intelligent academic manner \"our world is increasingly resembling a global shtetl... and it is precisely why it is so important nowadays to research language contact in general and Yiddish in particular\". It is exactly this approach whereby Yiddish is linked with the most recent and far-reaching worldwide developments (and in the very world of loshn koydesh, the \u201cSacred Tongue\u201d, itself), which is so reminiscent of, and is the successor of, the pioneering work of Uriel Weinreich's truly great work Languages in Contact (1953)... \r\n\r\n...There remains a great deal for Yiddish/Jewish intra- and inter-linguistics still to be done and it is with such young and creative innovative scholarly forces like Ghil\u2018ad Zuckermann that one can imagine that great progress will take place in the field in the very near future, and that this progress will also enrich our knowledge and deepen our appreciation and admiration of Yiddish itself... \r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLES RELATED TO THE BOOK IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ISRAELI\r\n\r\nYIDDISH: By famous sociolinguist Prof. Joshua Fishman: http://yiddish.forward.com/node/1753\r\n\r\nDUTCH: Hebreeuws / De mythe van de bijbelse taal \\ Inez Polak, Trouw: http://www.trouw.nl/achtergrond/deverdieping/article1423323.ece\r\n\r\nENGLISH: \r\n\r\n* Hebrew or Israeli?

But just as the \u2018Jerusalem artichoke\u2019 has to do with neither Jerusalem nor artichoke (even though some Jerusalem restaurants take pride in serving it), what Sarid and Levitan call \u2018corrupt Hebrew\u2019 is neither corrupt nor Hebrew: it is grammatical Israeli, a beautifully multi-layered and intricately multi-sourced language that one should embrace and celebrate.\r\n \r\nBy GHIL\u2018AD ZUCKERMANN\r\n\r\nSeveral days before the publication in Tel Aviv of my most recent book by Am Oved Publishing House, I finally received its cover. Ignoring the idiom \u2018don\u2019t judge a book by its cover\u2019, I looked at it and darkness was made in my eyes: whereas the title of the book was israelit safa yafa, i.e. ISRAELI, A Beautiful Language (challenging and modelled upon the old Zionist slogan ivrit safa yafa \u2018Hebrew is a beautiful language\u2019), the last sentence on the back cover was \u2018this is his first book in HEBREW\u2019! Worriedly, I called Am Oved and was given an ultimatum: either we leave it as \u2018this is his first book in Hebrew\u2019 or change it to \u2018this is his first book in Israeli and his last book at Am Oved\u2019!\r\n\r\nEventually, the compromise was \u2018this is his first book published in Israel\u2019. \u2018What\u2019s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet\u2019, says Juliet (Yael) to Romeo (Ram) in a piece by the famous playwright referred to by Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi as \u2018Sheikh Zubeir\u2019. There are cases in which the name is extremely important because it determines the way people perceive the thing it stands for. Just as thought influences language, language can shape thought. Already 2,500 years ago, Confucius said that the first thing one has to do is to rectify names!\r\n\r\nHybridity and native speech \r\n\r\nHad I continued to call Israeli \u2013 misleadingly \u2013 \u2018Modern Hebrew\u2019, \u2018Israeli Hebrew\u2019 or merely \u2018Hebrew\u2019, the readers might have assumed that my model is yet another wise-guy version of the regnant, albeit pregnant, view that Israeli is simply an evolution of Hebrew, influenced by \u2018foreign languages\u2019 such as Yiddish. But that\u2019s a far cry from the two main arguments in the book:\r\n\r\n1. Hybridity: Israeli is not an evolutionary phase of Hebrew but rather a new hybrid language, simultaneously based on \u2018sleeping beauty\u2019 \u2013 or \u2018walking dead\u2019 \u2013 Hebrew, the revivalists\u2019 mother tongue Yiddish, as well as a plethora of other languages spoken by Jewish pioneers in Palestine in the 1880s-1930s. Thus, Yiddish is not a \u2018foreign language\u2019 vis-\u00e0-vis Israeli, and intu\u00edtsya \u2018intuition\u2019, to give but one example out of tens of thousands \u2013 is not a loan word but rather an integral part of Israeli from its very beginning.\r\n\r\n2. Native speech: There is no good reason to force a Hebrew grammar on native Israeli-speakers, simply because they already speak their mother tongue perfectly, according to grammar rules in their brain. French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu used the term \u2018habitus\u2019 to refer to a social convention, for example chopsticks versus knife-and-fork. Unlike literary language, which is indeed a \u2018habitus\u2019, the native spoken tongue is not learnt but rather acquired automatically and effortlessly. This is the diametric opposite of the admired, albeit mistaken, claim, made in 1953, by the former president of the Academy of the Hebrew Language Ze\u2019ev Ben-Hayyim: \u2018one learns his spoken language in years of effort, in very hard work throughout one\u2019s life\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between hybridity and native speech, the two linguistic characteristics championed by Israeli, A Beautiful Language, is complex. Supporting one of them does not necessarily imply accepting the other. For example, I might convince some that Israeli is a wonderful mishmash of many languages but they would still prefer enforcing an elitist standard on Israeli-speakers. Overlooking its hybrid vigour, others might continue to blindly believe that Israeli is Hebrew but would still allow Israelis to speak as they wish. Nevertheless, the main innovation in the book \u2013 besides the hybridity model \u2013 is the link between hybridity and native speech: Even if there are numerous Israelis who \u2013 unlike me \u2013 believe that we must enforce a standard, the book might convince them to modify the characteristics of that standard: who said that it must be based on Hebrew?\r\n\r\nConstructive, destructive and deconstructive critiques\r\n\r\nHow was the book received by the dozens of wonderful critics? There were compliments, for example \u2018Yiddish is the passion of the young and brilliant linguist Ghil\u2018ad Zuckermann\u2026 The large inventory of examples that he puts forth, classifies and names\u2026is definitely worth listening to and learning from\u2019 (Yitzhak Laor, Haaretz, 9.1.09); \u2018Zuckermann has written a witty, fascinating and amusing book\u2026This innovative book provides exemplification through grammar\u2019 (Prof. Menachem Perry, Ynet, 20.1.09); \u2018Illuminating in a convincing (and most amusing) way\u2019 (Prof. Israel Bartal, Yediot Aharonot, 9.1.09); \u2018This book needs to be accepted and bring about a certain change in the common conservative views, both educational and scientific\u2019 (Aharon Porat, Makor Rishon, 9.1.09); \u2018Zuckermann argues \u2013 and demonstrates \u2013 that Israelis do not speak Hebrew\u2026His comprehensive survey of the changes in the language \u2013 in pronunciation, stress, suffixes, borrowings from foreign languages \u2013 is nothing short of fascinating and\u2026written in a surprisingly accessible way\u2019 (Pe\u2019er Friedman, Maariv, 26.12.08); \u2018Israeli, A Beautiful Language demonstrates in a convincing way how different Israeli Hebrew is from Biblical Hebrew, and at the same time provides a treasure-trove of anecdotes for many hours of discussion\u2019 (Tal Linzen, Time Out Tel Aviv, 22.1.09); \u2018exhilarating\u2019 (Yaron London, London et Kirshenbaum, Channel 10, Israeli TV, 15.1.09); \u2018energetic\u2019 (Nissan Shor, Time Out Tel Aviv, 29.1.09); \u2018with respectable courage\u2019 (Ruvik Rosenthal, Haaretz, 10.6.09).\r\n\r\nBut \u2013 as expected \u2013 there were also attacks. Hagai Hitron gave the following telling verdict: \u2018an interesting but annoying book\u2019, \u2018convincing, cute, harmful\u2019, (Haaretz, 24.12.08). Zvia Walden and Guy Deutscher insisted that \u2018Hebrew is Hebrew is Hebrew!\u2019 (Haaretz, 24.4.09). Whereas Noam Ordan argued that \u2018this book calls for in-depth discussion\u2019 (Haaretz, 24.12.08), Yossi Sarid \u2013 a left-wing politician, though when it comes to language: a fanatic purist \u2013 announced that \u2018\u00e9ser sh\u00e9kel (\u2018ten shekels\u2019, the common speech violating the Academy of Hebrew Language regulations) is talking out of your arse!\u2019 (Haaretz, 28.12.08). Amos Levitan submits that \u2018Israeli is simply corrupt Hebrew\u2019 (Iton 77, March-April 2009). Sarid, Hitron, Levitan and many others clearly cannot free themselves from \u2018asara sheqalim (10 shekels) and the other the shackles of what I call the \u2018purism prism\u2019. But just as the \u2018Jerusalem artichoke\u2019 has to do with neither Jerusalem nor artichoke (even though some Jerusalem restaurants take pride in serving it), what Sarid and Levitan call \u2018corrupt Hebrew\u2019 is neither corrupt nor Hebrew: it is grammatical Israeli, a beautifully multi-layered and intricately multi-sourced language that one should embrace and celebrate.\r\n\r\nOne of the most perspicacious comments was made by Ordan: \u2018what amazed me about the response was that knowing absolutely nothing about the book did not stop people from disagreeing with it \u2013 and vehemently at that\u2019. Compare it with Benny Zipper\u2019s \u2018it is about time, really, that scholars should return to the ivory tower from which they came\u2019 (Haaretz Online, 19.12.08). The well-known blogger who defines himself as \u2018elite\u2019 is asking to stand alone on the podium and send those disagreeing with him to the place where they come from. I wonder why.\r\n\r\nFrom the \u2018Promised Land\u2019 to the \u2018Lucky Country\u2019\r\n\r\nWhilst author and linguist Ruvik Rosenthal suggested that \u2018Zuckermann is brilliant and erudite, and he raises important issues\u201d (NRG Maariv, 18.12.08), came Zipper and remarked that \u2018this long-haired, jumpy professor\u2026 is honouring us with a visit to the motherland\u2019. Does funny Zipper, by any chance, suggest that an Israeli living in Australia does not have the right to say anything about the Israeli language?\r\n\r\nHaving mentioned Australia, what lessons could one draw from the revival in the Promised Land to current revival attempts of no-longer spoken Aboriginal languages in the Lucky Country? Heaps! Firstly, given that the Hebrew revivalists, who wished to speak pure Hebrew, failed in their purism prism, it is simply hard to imagine more successful revival attempts \u2013 for the following reasons: (1) the remarkable strength of the Jewish revivalists\u2019 motivation, zealousness, Hebrew consciousness, and centuries of \u2018next year in Jerusalem\u2019 ideology, and (2) the extensive documentation of Hebrew \u2013 as opposed to \u2018sleeping\u2019 Aboriginal languages. I propose that the revival of a clinically dead language is unlikely without cross-fertilization from the revivalists\u2019 mother tongue(s). I therefore predict that any attempt to revive an Aboriginal language will result in a hybrid. \r\n\r\nThat is of course not to say that we should not revive dead languages and cultures. On the contrary! My research on the transition from ancient Hebrew to new Israeli should encourage Aboriginal leaders and revival linguists to be more realistic about their goals, and can share with them crucial linguistic insights about what components of language are more revivable than others. Words and conjugations, for example, are easier to revitalize than intonation, associations and connotations. \r\n\r\nSome Aboriginal people distinguish between usership and ownership. I even have a friend who claimed that he owned a language although he only knew one single word in it, namely its name. Consequently, one could find indigenous Australians who do not find it necessary or important to revive their 'sleeping'/comatose tongue. I, on the other hand, have always believed in Australia\u2019s very own roadside dictum: \u2018Stop, revive, survive!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\u05e9\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d1\u05de\u05d1\u05d7\u05df \u05d4\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d1\u05d7\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9, \u05e7\u05d9\u05e5 \u05d4\u05ea\u05e9\u05e1\"\u05d8, 17.6.2009\r\n\r\nOn 17 June 2009, the compulsory National Israeli Matriculation Exam (\u2018Bagrut\u2019 \u2013 cf.

These colonial borders have often been discussed as artificial, dividing communities, people or ethnicities that otherwise would belong together. Such an interpretation of colonial borders, I argue in this article, overlooks another important aspect of colonial boundaries: their role in creating nations as 'imagined communities' who in making reference to such borders can lay claim to a distinct national identity. While such an identity can be exclusionary and trigger conflict, it can also have a much more positive and ultimately hybrid function. I use the case of Italian colonialism in the Horn of Africa to demonstrate these multiple roles colonial boundaries can occupy and focus specifically on the creation and contestations of the borders of Eritrea. I argue that the acceptance of borders as markers of identity can be a prerequisite for finding innovative ways to overcome exclusions in the everyday lives of borderland groups. Thus, the example of Eritrea could hold wider lessons for addressing postcolonial disputes about borders and boundaries, if institutional arrangements are put in place that allow fluidity in everyday encounters.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63386780, "asset_id": 43128677, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10948657, "first_name": "Tanja", "last_name": "M\u00fcller", "domain_name": "manchester", "page_name": "TanjaMueller", "display_name": "Tanja R M\u00fcller", "profile_url": "https://manchester.academia.edu/TanjaMueller?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10948657/9952098/11097606/s65_tanja.mueller.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22892, "name": "Eritrea", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eritrea?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 249304, "name": "Borders and Borderlands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borders_and_Borderlands?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 651460, "title": "\"Let No One Wonder at this Image\": A Phoenician Funerary Stele in Athens", "created_at": "2011-06-08T03:06:11.006-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/651460/_Let_No_One_Wonder_at_this_Image_A_Phoenician_Funerary_Stele_in_Athens?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_651460", "summary": "An autopsy of the Hellenistic grave stele, discovered in the 19th century in the Kerameikos in Athens, reveals that its textual (Phoenician and Greek) and visual components differ significantly from previously published descriptions.

I will be focusing on the concept of cultural hybridity, an umbrella term designating those cultural practices that have stem med? out of the historical, political, and social 'transculturation' in the West Indies and that the three authors raise in different ways yet with similar intents and results. As Edward Kamau Brathwaite has pointed out, \" to see Jamaica or the West Indies just as a 'slave' society is as much a falsification of reality as the seeing of the island as a naval station or an enormous sugar factory \" .1 What was crucial there was indeed the coexistence of various people, neither of them resident in the area, struggling to adapt themselves to a new environment and to each other. This resulted in a complex situation involving assimilation as well as rejection, complicity as well as subversion from both sides, a two-way process that, moving as it did from a cultural clash, gave birth to different and creative models of interculturation. Jamaican authors Erna Brodber and her sister Velma Pollard, together with New York-based Caryl Phillips, have valued the significance of cultural hybridity in their narrative portraits of the West Indies. Although their writings have highlighted different 'shades' of hybridity, such as the ambiguous idea of home in cross-cultural societies and the experience of the miscegenated child, overall they have tried to present it as a mark of strength rather than a weakness in their search for Caribbean individual and collective identity(ies), unraveling its power to subvert what has been called \" the Manichean dichotomy \" that Western culture adopts when trying to make sense of the multiplicity of Caribbean experience and history. In this respect, Erna Brodber chooses to give voice to the mulatto outcast in Myal (1988), her second novel that won her the Commonwealth Regional Prize the same year. The novel is a succeeded example of multi-layered fiction, where beyond the level of narration, there is a dense pattern of allusive imagery to be untangled by the reader. Right from the title, Brodber plays with the ambivalence of the word 'spirit': Myalism is indeed the Caribbean art of spirit liberation; yet, the novel deals also with the recovery of one's lost spirit, in the sense of both individual and collective voice, self-consciousness and agency. The protagonist of the novel, Ella, is an in between girl, born of a light skinned Jamaican woman and an Irish officer, thus she looks like an exotic stranger to her black folks, (the \" alabaster baby in a sea of colours \" 2); nevertheless, her hybrid state of 'unbelonging' gives her the chance to live without attaching herself to a specific place and without reclaiming a fixed, secure identity. In fact, despite the opening scene, brings us in the middle of a magic session aimed at healing the girl, Ella will eventually be the true catalyst for change, a change that is constantly referred to and, to some extent, longed for throughout the novel. Ella is indeed possessed by some negative forces affecting her body; yet in the end, she will \" possess \" the force not only to recover, but also to actively help her folks in recovering from their symbolical \" evil spirits, \" which Brodber identifies with the colonizing power. Throughout the novel, Brodber seems to oppose hybridity to all violent superimpositions of foreign cultures for the sake of some sort of 'purity'. While all forms of hybridity open up to many creative possibilities, the dichotomical oppositions centre/margin, white/black, good/evil, and mind/body inevitably result in a rupture for those who are interpreted as the recipients of the", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46441318, "asset_id": 26088479, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 82691, "first_name": "Marika", "last_name": "Preziuso", "domain_name": "massart", "page_name": "MarikaPreziuso", "display_name": "Marika Preziuso", "profile_url": "https://massart.academia.edu/MarikaPreziuso?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/82691/23004/14449313/s65_marika.preziuso.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6259, "name": "Caribbean Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caribbean_Literature?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 24962107, "title": "A Confucian Education for Europeans", "created_at": "2016-05-02T18:48:39.749-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24962107/A_Confucian_Education_for_Europeans?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_24962107", "summary": "The analysis of two collections of hybrid prints of Chinese subjects published in Paris on the eve of the French Revolution by the French engraver Isidore-Stanislas Helman reveals that they were the result of a series of cross-cultural encounters that had involved many parties from China to France.

Hybridity itself, however, is often treated as a specifically post-colonial phenomenon. The contributors in this volume assume the historicity of transcultural flows and entanglements; they consider the resulting transformative powers to be a basic feature of cultural change. By juxtaposing different notions of hybridization and specific methodologies, as they appear in the various disciplines, this volume\u2019s design is transdisciplinary. Each author presents a disciplinary concept of hybridization and shows how it operates in specific case studies. The aim is to generate a transdisciplinary perception of hybridity that paves the way for a wider application of this crucial concept.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 24707079, "asset_id": 1797813, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 88199, "first_name": "Philipp Wolfgang", "last_name": "Stockhammer", "domain_name": "lmu-munich", "page_name": "PhilippWolfgangStockhammer", "display_name": "Philipp Wolfgang  Stockhammer", "profile_url": "https://lmu-munich.academia.edu/PhilippWolfgangStockhammer?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/88199/24562/21342032/s65_philipp_wolfgang.stockhammer.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 399, "name": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Archaeology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3016, "name": "Mediterranean prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mediterranean_prehistory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5346, "name": "Archaeological Method & Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Method_and_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 8536, "name": "Hybridization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridization?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 9802, "name": "Liminality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liminality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 12796, "name": "Theoretical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theoretical_Archaeology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13515, "name": "Aegean Bronze Age (Bronze Age Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aegean_Bronze_Age_Bronze_Age_Archaeology_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13995, "name": "Postcolonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 18032, "name": "Aegean Prehistory (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aegean_Prehistory_Archaeology_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 18821, "name": "Archaeological Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 25663, "name": "Aegean Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aegean_Archaeology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 31752, "name": "Archeologia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archeologia?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 34817, "name": "Prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 103557, "name": "Arch\u00e9ologie", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arch%C3%A9ologie?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 134056, "name": "Dislocation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dislocation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 153884, "name": "Multilingual Studies, Identity Studies, Border identities, hybridity, multilingualism, poetry, bilingual poetry, cultural studies, postcolonial studies, globalization studies, third culture kids", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingual_Studies_Identity_Studies_Border_identities_hybridity_multilingualism_poetry_bilin?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 196103, "name": "Ur und Fr\u00fchgeschichte", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ur_und_Fruhgeschichte?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 336263, "name": "Entangled History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Entangled_History?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1009651, "name": "Cultural Intersectionality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Intersectionality?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 67583125, "title": "DONNA J.

Haraway addresses deeply situated feminist explorations and varied epistemologies and ecologies. It contains figurative criticism of the current environmental crises that forms the emergency of the Anthropocene. Haraway traverses alternative ways of knowing how the subject\u2019s experiences of past, present, future, gender, culture, race all dissolve into each other and need continuous interrogations to arrive at the evolving notions of subjecthood and environment. The book investigates the material semiotics, political histories of different surfaces, mythologies, species, and stories and forces us to establish contact with other existents in search of harmonious ways of survival. In our age when global politics and global capital are operating by destruction and distortion of natural resources, the book emerges as an inevitable counter by-product of staying with the trouble.\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 78346969, "asset_id": 67583125, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9074018, "first_name": "Asijit", "last_name": "Datta", "domain_name": "kiit", "page_name": "AsijitDatta", "display_name": "Asijit Datta", "profile_url": "https://kiit.academia.edu/AsijitDatta?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9074018/57506541/45725497/s65_asi.dat.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3115, "name": "Posthumanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Posthumanism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3233, "name": "Animal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Animal_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9846, "name": "Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10101, "name": "Critical Posthumanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Posthumanism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 18845, "name": "Environmental Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Sustainability?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 34273, "name": "Transhumanism/Posthumanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transhumanism_Posthumanism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 40329, "name": "Donna Haraway", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Donna_Haraway?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 48523, "name": "Book Reviews", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Book_Reviews?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 111956, "name": "Feminist Posthumanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminist_Posthumanism?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 31671338, "title": "\" PREPARED IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE HAGARITES \" : ABBOT MKHITAR'S 1727 ARMENO-TURKISH GRAMMAR OF MODERN WESTERN ARMENIAN", "created_at": "2017-03-01T20:37:21.159-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31671338/_PREPARED_IN_THE_LANGUAGE_OF_THE_HAGARITES_ABBOT_MKHITARS_1727_ARMENO_TURKISH_GRAMMAR_OF_MODERN_WESTERN_ARMENIAN?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_31671338", "summary": "A Study of the Allographic or Heterographic hybrid literary tradition created in Armeno-Turkish through a microanalysis of Abbot Mkhitar's grammar of Western Armenian (1727, Venice) written in vernacular Anatolian Turkish.

In many cases, postcolonial theory has been an important resource for such interpretations. It has emphasized the imperial (or colonial) character of Roman rule and provided avenues of analysis of resistant action and discourse that are well grounded in theoretical and comparative context. Postcolonialism, however, does more than identify and valorize resistance; it also attends to the discourses of affiliation that colonial subjects so often generate. Homi Bhabha's articulation of `hybridity' as a rubric under which to understand the relationship between resistant and affiliative responses by colonial subjects enables a deeper understanding of Paul specifically in that area that the politically engaged readings of Paul have made even more enigmatic, namely the relationship of the affiliative Rom. 13.1-7 to the apostle's evidently resistant discourse elsewhere in his literary corpus.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32420646, "asset_id": 5237049, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1500467, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Marshall", "domain_name": "utoronto", "page_name": "JohnMarshall", "display_name": "John W Marshall", "profile_url": "https://utoronto.academia.edu/JohnMarshall?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1500467/2683979/3123759/s65_john.marshall.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23555, "name": "Roman Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Roman_Empire?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 96098, "name": "Resistance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Resistance?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 656787, "name": "Homi Bhabha", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homi_Bhabha?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1125509, "name": "Postcolonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonialism?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 35516050, "title": "G\u00fcncel Sanatta Yeni Bir Yakla\u015f\u0131m Olarak\r\n\u201cMelezlik\u201d", "created_at": "2017-12-26T22:48:17.689-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35516050/G%C3%BCncel_Sanatta_Yeni_Bir_Yakla%C5%9F%C4%B1m_Olarak_Melezlik_?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_35516050", "summary": "\u00d6zet Abstract Son y\u0131llarda, \u00e7e\u015fitli geli\u015fmelerle birlikte k\u00fclt\u00fcrlerin i\u00e7 i\u00e7e ge\u00e7ti\u011fi ve disiplinlerin birbirlerine h\u0131zl\u0131ca yakla\u015ft\u0131\u011f\u0131 g\u00f6r\u00fclmektedir.

In recent years, it has been seen that the cultures are intertwined with various developments and the disciplines are rapidly approaching each other. As a result of this rapprochement, \" things \" are losing their \" pureness \" and singularity and thus forming pluralistic structures. It is an indisputable fact that sharp borders are weakened and frames are destroyed in almost all areas wherever human beings, the most important player, are who touch, produce and connect in any way. In the present day the progress that bring globalization having each duty to activate, primarily between cultural, have caused almost in all fields to come to an integrated and pluralistic structure and as a result they has emerged the concept of \" hybridity \" for all. In this study, terminological dimension of the concept of \" hybridity \" , its in the role of contemporary art and reason of its presence and in the framework of movement will be examined. Especially, After World War II discourses like human hybrid, hybrid cultures, hybrid economy, hybrid language and except of them, today in contemporary art, use of the term of \" hybridity \" being normal will be explained, even the term is as necessary. Through made visual work analysis and literature as a style of artistic expression within the scope of \" hybridity \" , \" hybrid art \" or \" hybridity in art \" evaluation of the works type will be made and be determined the positioned of these terms in \" Contemporary Art \" .", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55381284, "asset_id": 35516050, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

In the case of Indigenous tourism, a paradox often exists between maintaining a level of recognition and familiarity that mirror the expectations of the public imagination, and conveying a representation that is locally meaningful and emblematic. Investigation into the visual representation and communication of identity through tourism is a means to illustrate three overlapping issues that are prevalent throughout the literature on Indigenous tourism. These are: control, authenticity, and hybridity. This research project addresses these issues through an extensive review of anthropological and tourism-related literature and its application to the specific case study of one Indigenous tourism business, the Nk\u2019Mip Desert Cultural Centre (NDCC), owned and operated by the Osoyoos Indian Band (OIB) in Osoyoos, British Columbia (BC), Canada. Semiotic and visual analyses are used to elucidate the messages about OIB identity communicated through the Centre\u2019s visuals, in order to bring the example of the OIB and NDCC into conversation with the larger issues found within Indigenous tourism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 12635860, "asset_id": 1526259, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

"dom_id": "work_37316881", "summary": "Canadian poet Anne Carson\u2019s novel in verse, Autobiography of Red (1998), traces the development, in Bildungsroman fashion, of the mythical figure of Geryon, a winged red monster. The form of the work is not easy to unpack because it is neither a poem nor a novel, but a hybrid. Carson explores this multiplicity in her dual endings: one more lyrical\u2014the hero flying into the mouth of a volcano\u2014and the other more narrative- driven\u2014three friends strolling along a palisade. Although she must sequence the endings, Carson suggests their simultaneity, their inclusivity, just as she has invited her reader to be a co-creator in composing the literary text, beginning with a Emily Dickinson poem which asks, \u2018Can human nature not survive / Without a listener?\u2019 In this tale, it is the listener who propels the speaker to speak.\r\nIn attempting to delight (and surprise) her reader, Carson juggles these two different poetic plots or spheres, keeping them both in the air. Carson\u2019s strategy of pushing at the seams of poetry\u2014in a work chock-full of narrative information and yet bounding forward in a lyric frenzy\u2014challenges traditional genre distinctions. The only way for Carson to sustain all these potentially opposing elements/positions\u2014the narrative, the lyric, and the hybrid narrative/lyric; the writer, the text, and the reader\u2014is to create, as she does in the poem, a new kind of temporality: \u201cvolcano time,\u201d essentially exploded time that behaves like a lyrical epiphany. Volcano time includes the past, the present, and the future in one instant, while keeping them still separate, \u201ctouching not touching.\u201d\r\nFor Carson, time is crucial because it is the vehicle that allows Eros or desire to flourish, to let lovers both join and remain separate. Volcano time can simultaneously stop and accelerate time. It contains both the reaching for desire and the retreating from desire. As Carson asserts in her book of essays, Eros the Bittersweet (1986), \u201cthe self forms at the edge of desire.\u201d The hybrid form of Autobiography of Red, centered on the agreement (and occasional disagreement) between writer and reader, borrows from Kenneth Burke\u2019s definition of form in literature in \u201cLexicon Rhetoricae\u201d as \u201can arousing and fulfillment of desires. A work has form in so far as one part of it leads a reader to anticipate another part, to be gratified by the sequence.\u201d\r\nA reader, then, experiences Carson\u2019s hybrid form\u2014her volcano time\u2014by watching how the novel in verse unfolds, how it draws the reader in and satisfies (and deflects) desires. Of course, desire is not easily captured because it is always in flux. In the end, Carson\u2019s reader is poised as human desire (and the hero Geryon) is poised\u2014on, in Carson\u2019s words, \u201can axis of paradox, absence and presence its poles, love and hate its motive energies.\u201d By challenging conventional expectations of genre and narrative temporality, Carson ultimately makes her reader\u2019s presence in this triad necessary and binding: a literary contract. Instead of passionately and exclusively exchanging with her characters/speakers\u2014making her reader a passive witness to the affair\u2014Carson creates a poetic form wherein the reader, not the text, is the beloved.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wvttrier.de/top/Proceedings_2015_WVT.pdf\r\n[See pages 219-230]", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57277164, "asset_id": 37316881, "asset_type": "Work",

In itself this provides no justification for the relative dearth (in geography) of theorizing 'with' the uterus as a site of doing and undoing; what I propose to call uterine geography. 'Uterine' relations are fundamentally cyborg, animatedly labouring and not only spatial but spatializing: they make and unmake places, borders, kin. This includes not only abortion, miscarriage, menstruation and pregnancy (whose transcorporeal and chimeric character is well documented in medical anthropology) but also other life-enabling forms of holding and letting go that do not involve anatomical uteri (such as trans-mothering and other alter-familial practices). Despite our discipline's ostensible interest in co-production, hybridity and the more-than-human, the 'doing' aspects of intra and interuterine processes have tended to be black-boxed in accounts of care economies and social reproduction. The proposed remedy is deromanticization: an approach that critically politicizes uterine relations as historically contingent and subject to amelioration through struggle. Potential aides include Maggie Nelson's idea that 'labor does you', Suzanne Sadedin's account of gestation's mutual hostility and the concepts of 'sym-poiesis' and 'metramorphosis'. One notable consequence of this expanded concept of the uterine is that 'assisted reproduction', as it is characterized today, ceases to be categorically separate from other kinds of reproduction.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58085716, "asset_id": 38060888, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83197229, "first_name": "Sophie", "last_name": "Lewis", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SophieLewis31", "display_name": "Sophie A Lewis", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SophieLewis31?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/83197229/19944826/19742942/s65_sophie.lewis.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1032, "name": "Cyborg Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyborg_Theory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2624, "name": "Transgender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transgender_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3114, "name": "Queer Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Theory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3126, "name": "Political Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Ecology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4559, "name": "Reproduction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reproduction?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 14426, "name": "Political Economies of Capitalism, Imperialism/Colonialism, Racism, and Patriarchy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Economies_of_Capitalism_Imperialism_Colonialism_Racism_and_Patriarchy?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 27552, "name": "Reproductive Biology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reproductive_Biology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 40211, "name": "Marxist and Materialist Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marxist_and_Materialist_Feminism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 60210, "name": "Caring / Care Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caring_Care_Ethics?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 62550, "name": "Pregnancy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pregnancy?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 69180, "name": "Social reproduction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_reproduction?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 94901, "name": "Health and Social Care", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Health_and_Social_Care?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1653419, "name": "Microchimerism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Microchimerism?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 32649463, "title": "As the Pendulum Swings -The Revival of the Hybrid Tribunal", "created_at": "2017-04-25T10:18:54.808-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32649463/As_the_Pendulum_Swings_The_Revival_of_the_Hybrid_Tribunal?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_32649463", "summary": "This chapter examines the recent resurgence of hybrid tribunals and seeks to explain why they have \u2018returned\u2019 as a viable model of international criminal justice. It proceeds as follows. The first section of the chapter briefly defines and describes hybrid tribunals before illustrating the resurgence in their use since 2015. A number of recently established and proposed hybrid courts are outlined. The second section of the chapter seeks to explain the reasons behind the \u2018rebirth\u2019 of hybrid tribunals. It situates their reemergence amidst the confluence of three broad factors: the increasingly evident limitations of the ICC; the waning view that the Court must be the only purveyor of international criminal justice; and the ongoing utility of hybrid tribunals. The chapter then argues, in section three, that hybrid courts should form an important part of a \u2018network\u2019 of international criminal justice alongside, rather than in competition with, the ICC or domestic judiciaries. The section also offers the creation of a permanent hybrid tribunal as a means to consolidate such a network of global justice. Finally, the chapter concludes by arguing that the revival of hybrid tribunals is unlikely to be ad hoc and that, even if they eventually fall out of fashion again, proponents of international criminal justice would do well to study and understand their benefits and advantages.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52818275, "asset_id": 32649463, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 378428, "first_name": "Mark", "last_name": "Kersten", "domain_name": "utoronto", "page_name": "MarkKersten", "display_name": "Mark  Kersten", "profile_url": "https://utoronto.academia.edu/MarkKersten?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/378428/97222/17745839/s65_mark.kersten.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2575, "name": "International Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Law?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3692, "name": "International Criminal Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Criminal_Law?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5839, "name": "Kosovo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kosovo?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6618, "name": "International Criminal Court", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Criminal_Court?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 9251, "name": "Transitional Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transitional_Justice?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 9850, "name": "Sri Lanka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lanka?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 10191, "name": "Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Justice?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 29570, "name": "Chad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chad?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 200264, "name": "South Sudan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Sudan?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1139372, "name": "Central African Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Central_African_Republic?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 23765040, "title": "\"Twilight of the Ptolemies: Egyptian Presence on late Hellenistic Yeronisos\"", "created_at": "2016-03-29T07:28:14.524-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/23765040/_Twilight_of_the_Ptolemies_Egyptian_Presence_on_late_Hellenistic_Yeronisos_?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_23765040", "summary": " \u201cTwilight of the Ptolemies: Egyptian Presence on late Hellenistic Yeronisos,\u201d in Egypt and Cyprus in Antiquity, Proceedings of the International Conference, Nicosia, April 3-6, 2003, D.

The rapid pace of Arctic melting due to climate change has created opportunities to extract the region\u2019s previously inaccessible offshore oil and gas. The 2015 controversy over the Obama Administration\u2019s approval of Shell Oil\u2019s drilling in the Chukchi Sea followed by the company\u2019s decision to pull out highlighted the need for clear and effective regulation of Arctic drilling.\nOffshore oil spills are difficult to prevent and clean up, as showcased by the BP Deepwater Horizon accident \u2013 which occurred in an environment not plagued by Arctic ice and weather extremes. The complexity and fragmentation of existing governance arrangements further complicate matters. Numerous public and private entities are currently developing standards for Arctic drilling and spill response as new projects and accidents highlight the urgency of addressing risks. \n\nThis Article makes a novel proposal for addressing these challenges through what it terms \u201chybrid cooperation.\u201d In this form of cooperation, diverse public and private stakeholders at multiple governmental levels coordinate their efforts through either: (1) creating institutions or (2) integrating each other\u2019s standards in agreements and regulations. The Article uses original case studies to assess the possibilities for hybrid cooperation to make Arctic drilling safer and to create more cohesive governance. It argues that this convergence of standards and stakeholders, while piecemeal, helps to develop norms for how to operate in the Arctic. More broadly, this concept of hybrid cooperation \u2013 which draws from and contributes to interdisciplinary scholarship on hybrid governance \u2013 can shed light on governance challenges in other areas, such as humanitarian crisis management, transnational investment, climate change, and whaling.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40986165, "asset_id": 20064544, "asset_type": "Work",

"summary": "THE TWO EYES OF THE EARTH is the first sustained and theoretically rigorous study of the evolution of a supra-religious yet sacral cross-cultural language of kingship between the late Roman empire and Sasanian Iran (224-642 CE). It investigates the shared ideal of sacred kingship that emerged in the late Roman and Persian empires. This shared ideal, while often generating conflict during the four centuries of the empires' coexistence (224-642), also drove exchange, especially the means and methods Roman and Persian sovereigns used to project their notions of universal rule: elaborate systems of ritual and their cultures' visual, architectural, and urban environments. Matthew Canepa explores the artistic, ritual, and ideological interactions between Rome and the Iranian world under the Sasanian dynasty, the last great Persian dynasty before Islam. He analyzes how these two hostile systems of sacred universal sovereignty not only coexisted, but fostered cross-cultural exchange and communication despite their undying rivalry. Bridging the traditional divide between classical and Iranian history, this book brings to life the dazzling courts of two global powers that deeply affected the cultures of medieval Europe, Byzantium, Islam, South Asia, and China.\n\nhttp://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520257276\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=57szORf0_B0C&lpg=PP1&dq=the%20two%20eyes%20of%20the%20earth&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false",

Currently, the contemporary flamenco is studied from diverse continents and their artists have continued easily crossing their virtual borders and they have made collaborations with other musicians, acquiring other sounds, forms and harmonies.

As an idea, a symbol, an image, it has accompanied us until the present times, having mutated, undergone misinterpretations, acquired numerous iconographic and symbolic misunderstandings and purposeful deformations. This book is a historico-cultural monograph, and its protagonist has been shown therein \u2013 as represented by the collected examples of its manifestations \u2013 as a vessel of clear, dramatic, and at the same time dynamic, set of symbols which is an axis of various cultural narrations evolved in correspondence with different meanders of social and political history, the history of doctrine, mental transformations, esthetic changes and even changing fashions and tastes of different historical eras.\nThe problem of transformations of its symbolic meaning (enrichment and weakening) is both challenging and complex. It is a carrier of symbolism, and at the same time one of universal and detailed content transcending time, inadvertently non-identical in different historical periods. We are not always entitled to certify the \u201ccorrectness\u201d or \u201cnon-correctness\u201d of the symbol\u2019s interpretation.\nThe Sphinx is not only a \u201cmystery\u201d in the most wide understanding, or even in its trivialized quasi-mysteriousness, but also a guardian of this mystery, of its sacrum, an apotropaion, an esoteric figure, an initiator, \u201csilence\u201d, confession. It is, further, a peculiarity, an exotism, ambivalence and a unified oneness; an ancient, forgotten wisdom, memory, tradition, history, sempiternal existence, and at the same time, the inescapable transience of time, death and afterlife, horror, fear, suffering, emptiness and melancholy. The Sphinx is seen as an allegory of Egypt itself (the civilization of the pharaohs and modern Egypt as well) and \u2013 generally speaking \u2013 of Africa as a continent (today especially in tourist categories, formerly in the context of colonial conquest), but also an allegory of the entire ancient world. The Sphinx was seen as a personalization of mythology, religion (and sacrum as such), and also of Paganism, magic, art, knowledge (but sometimes also ignorance), science, majesty and power. The Sphinx is a so-called implicit symbol, as its representations (e.g., in visual arts) can be interpreted both symbolically and realistically. Relating the symbolical interpretations of the Sphinx to the perverse, insidious, sometimes cruel and always impenetrable essence of femininity, eroticism, the female-male relationship, authenticity and dualism, is a modernist legacy.\nThe aspect of its manifestation as a symbol, and especially the transformed representations of the iconographic Sphinx (predominantly the Egyptian or pseudo-Egyptian one) seems to be the most inspiring one within the imaginary - symbolic universe of modern culture, including popular culture. Here, the area of inquiry is permanently open.\nThe first part of the book is preceded by an insight into the history of research on the Sphinx. It is a kind of a guide to the sources of the subject matter; the beginning of the hybrid symbolism, the ancient genealogy of the Sphinx, its mythological and iconographic matrix and intercultural contexts in ancient Egypt (with an extensive digression on the Great Sphinx of Giza), Mesopotamia and Levantine cultures; followed by the transfer of the Sphinx phenomenon and at the same time its multifaceted evolutions and transformations into the Greek and Roman world (with the theme of Oedipus\u2019 riddle). This historical review is obviously necessary to indicate the possible cond tions whose consequences (intended or unintended), or even superseded, will be later reception meanders, revocations, interpretations (and reinterpretations) and symbolical-allegorical misinterpretations, and at the same time transformations, adaptations and modern inventions (e.g., iconographic ones).\nThe final link is the discussion of the Sphinx symbol and imagery in late Graeco-Roman era, the complex history of medieval hybrid imagery (bestiaria) and transformations of the reception of the Sphinx symbolism and imagery from the 15th to 18th century. I have devoted a little more room to the Sphinx in the polyhistorical concepts of Athanasius Kircher, in freemasonry speculations and I discuss travel accounts of the Great Sphinx of Giza in travel literature.\nAt the end of the 18th century, the Sphinx reception (which is not identical to its very presence in iconography, predominantly utilitarian than purely artistic), or, to put it generally, the Sphinx imagery, drifts around what we could call the \u201csemiotic zero\u201c. The trivial fields of exploitation, the context gap, pure, almost non-reflective decorativeness, poverty and triviality of pseudo-symbolic associations.\nThe chronological starting point of the second part of the book is the early 19th century, for a few reasons. First and foremost, the Sphinx motif was then incorporated into the monumental historiosophical and aesthetic considerations (art symbolism) of George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and the aftermath of the military and scientific campaign of Napoleon Bonaparte to Egypt resulted in an unusual intensification of the interest in Egypt and the legacy of the pharaohs, reflected in serious science and popular reception (the so-called Egyptomania). Such diverse and multi-value dissemination of the Sphinx theme was, at the same time, a spectacular increase in the presence of the image, motif and symbol of the Sphinx. Some scholars \u2013 such as Jean-Marcel Humbert \u2013 even claim that there is a separate, specific aspect of the early 19th century fascination with Egypt: \u201cSphinxomania\u201d. The Sphinx and its symbolic interpretations appear particularly often and in many intriguing ways.\nSince the 19th century literature until now, from Goethe\u2019s Faust, through O. Wilde, J. S\u0142owacki, M. Twain, H. Sienkiewicz, E. Schur\u00e9, H.G. Wells, to S. de Beauvoir), painting and illustration, utilitarian graphics and caricature \u2013 from Ingres, Moreau, Vedder, G\u00e9r\u00f4me and W. Kossak, von St\u00fcck, Rops, B\u00f6cklin, Styka, Toorop to Kupka, Bilk, Fini, Ernst, Dali and others), crafts and political metaphor, philosophical reflection and pseudo-philosophical esoteric to the variously articulated common reception, the Sphinx has been expoited in many intriguing ways. In the late 19th century Friedrich Nietzsche notes a distinct phenomenon of ungrounded overexploitation, or even dazzling with the symbolism and metaphor of the Sphinx, or the name itself, which he promptly referred to as umsphinxt.\nA separate summary, although still open, is a reflection on the presence of the Sphinx motif and symbol in times close to our present day. The Sphinx is incorporated surprisingly easily into the framework of Postmodernism, which grounded its identity on the basis of excluding tradition, or, generally speaking, \u201call that is old\u201d, to replace it with a new system of values (especially ethical and aesthetic), simultaneously proposing a kind of \u201cpan-eclecticism\u201d and \u201cpan-syncretism\u201d, rehabilitating practically all, even, contradictory traditions, creating an original value of paradox compilation, quotation, repetition, taken in the quotation marks of irony or distance, placing well known motifs in surprising, sometimes irritating or shocking contexts, purposefully anti-aesthetic, absurd, sometimes demolishing values and hierarchies. The Sphinx finds its place in the program of popular culture, offering something that in the system of its values (pseudo-values or anti-values) is the most attractive: an intriguing,

It springs from my practice as a composer and improvising guitarist, exploring the borders between South Indian Carnatic music and jazz. The process of collaborating with musicians from different traditions raises questions about the ways that musicians draw on their acquired knowledge in the production of intercultural music: How do musicians from different cultures interpret each others\u2019 musical gestures and negotiate a cohesive performance? At play throughout the dissertation are the conflicting notions of individual expression, and culturally derived archetypal models of expression. The relationship between musicians and cultures is explored through an ethnographic methodology.\n\nThe dissertation begins with a critical review of the literature on intercultural hybridity that reveals the way that power inequalities have historically characterised many of the exchanges between the West and its Others. In the course of analysing the products of interculture, the discussion also examines the inherent problem of hybridity\u2019s reception, given the different cultural frames of reference of different audiences. From the analysis of hybridity, improvisation emerges as a key locus for examining the way in which musicians are heard to negotiate self and culture in intercultural hybridity.\n\nA new understanding of improvisation is proposed based on an examination of the literature from diverse disciplines including cognitive psychology, complex adaptive systems, embodiment and ethnographic accounts of improvisers. Improvisation is situated as a dynamic process of developing preferences based on cultural acquisition, which enables us to understand the different approaches developed by improvisers and broader cultural differences between musical systems. The relationship between improvisation and culture necessitates a rethinking of the way that we listen to and analyse the products of interculture.\n\nI propose the critical framework of Discursive Interculturality as a way of unpacking intercultural exchange through a close analysis of the musical work. This type of analysis is based on the theories of hybridity and improvisation as developed in previous chapters, to reveal the intersection of cultural archetypes and individual expression within the intercultural hybrid work. In doing so it reveals the way that power is implicated in intercultural exchange through collaboration and performance and reveals the way that musicians play their culture and play beyond their culture in intercultural hybridity.\n\nDiscursive Interculturality is tested as a form of critical analysis used to examine two case studies from my practice: the intercultural concert series Cows at the Beach (Wren, 2011, 2013), and a jazz quartet recording, Rich and Famous (Wren, 2012). The specific ways in which Carnatic and jazz structures have evolved to enable creative expression are explored as an important piece of context and to show how they have informed the various experimental compositional structures and collaborative frameworks employed in the case studies. These compositional structures are described as a way of establishing the enabling and limiting factors on the improvisers. The Discursive Intercultural analysis examines recordings of the case studies, participant interviews, reflective practice, music analysis and recordings and reveals the way that musicians draw on their cultural inheritance in negotiating a satisfactory musical outcome based on intercultural dialogue. The recording of the Ultimate Cows concert (Wren et al. 2013) acts as a musical coda to the dissertation, serving to answer some of the questions raised and demonstrating a dialogic intercultural project based on a Discursive Intercultural aesthetic.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63986117, "asset_id": 43683891, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5232992, "first_name": "Toby", "last_name": "Wren", "domain_name": "griffith", "page_name": "TobyWren", "display_name": "Toby  Wren", "profile_url": "https://griffith.academia.edu/TobyWren?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5232992/2303730/35745589/s65_toby.wren.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27619, "name": "Jazz Improvisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jazz_Improvisation?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 31221, "name": "InterCultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/InterCultural_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41198, "name": "Intercultural Music fusions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intercultural_Music_fusions?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47795, "name": "Carnatic Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Carnatic_Music?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 53034, "name": "Cultural hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_hybridity?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 24052209, "title": "EFD / JFL Geoffrey Chaucer's Hybrid Woman: The Prioress in The Canterbury Tales", "created_at": "2016-04-05T01:53:42.316-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24052209/EFD_JFL_Geoffrey_Chaucers_Hybrid_Woman_The_Prioress_in_The_Canterbury_Tales?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_24052209", "summary": "Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales presents pilgrims whose status in the medieval three estates is not clearly defined. The Prioress is one of those pilgrims who experiences in-betweenness as she lives in what Bhabha terms the \" territories \" (1994, p. 28) of her former and present estates, the nobility and the clergy respectively. In fact, the members of medieval monasteries were mostly of the noble origin. Generally, it was not the choice of the members of the nobility to enter monasteries; yet, it was the wish of their families. Thereby, most of the noble men and women had to leave their previously secular and worldly life behind and live in full compliance with the monastic rules which required an entirely ascetic life. Accordingly, in most cases, the noble members of monasteries had difficulty in adjusting to monastic life which put them in between the territories of their former and present estates, in what Bhabha terms \" a third space \" (1994, p. 28). As they neither completely belonged to the nobility nor to the clergy, those nobles of monasteries lived in a third space contesting the territories of both estates. Thus, they became medieval hybrids. Similar to her historical counterparts, Chaucer's Prioress of noble birth can find a fixed status or identity neither in the nobility nor in the clergy, and she has to live in between them. That is, the Prioress develops a hybrid identity at the interface between her former and present estates. Within this context, this paper aims to discuss Chaucer's Prioress in The Canterbury Tales as a medieval hybrid who occupies a medieval third space on the borders between the nobility and the clergy. \n\u00d6z Geoffrey Chaucer'\u0131n Canterbury Hikayeleri Orta\u00e7a\u011f'\u0131n \u00fc\u00e7 s\u0131n\u0131f\u0131nda yeri tam olarak belli olmayan hac\u0131lar\u0131 resmeder.

musical styles on R\u00e9union Island as a way of representing local tradition and Creole culture and identity. My central aim is to show how different cultural actors use music traditions to position themselves within a larger transcultural setting. T\u2019sh\u00e9ga, Sh\u00e9ga, and S\u00e9ga are terms used to describe a popular music in the Indian Ocean. S\u00e9ga can be found on many islands in this region.

In this article I introduce Osorio's poetry as an example of indigenous ecocriticism interacting with global power flows as she astutely pinpoints an asymmetry of causation and impact dictated by economic and racial power. Her anger is rooted in her genealogy as a kanaka maoli woman, an American citizen, a queer poet and indigenous activist. K\u0101naka maoli trace their genealogy back to the islands of Hawai\u02bbi, and make little distinction between human and non-human family; many feel real fury at the environmental destruction capitalist-driven development has wreaked on their islands. Historian Arif Dirlik posited that indigenous epistemologies 'assume strategic significance' as 'counter resolutions to the contradictions of hybridity'. I suggest that Osorio's career is metonymic of the techniques k\u0101naka maoli have used for centuries to ensure cultural survival; remaining rooted in place whilst working to build audiences and allies internationally. Osorio's poetry performances, watched on YouTube by thousands of people across the world, provide a lens through which contemporary indigeneity can be observed replacing itself, using international networks, in a national system which continues to privilege movement over fixity regardless of the cost to the places it moves between.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56700119, "asset_id": 36754189, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6481722, "first_name": "Emma", "last_name": "Scanlan", "domain_name": "canterbury", "page_name": "EmmaScanlan", "display_name": "Emma Scanlan", "profile_url": "https://canterbury.academia.edu/EmmaScanlan?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6481722/3082957/37089623/s65_emma.scanlan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3581, "name": "Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poetry?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21325, "name": "Ecopoetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecopoetics?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34645, "name": "Performance Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance_Poetry?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 142812, "name": "Hawaii", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hawaii-1?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 187242, "name": "Neocolonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neocolonialism?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 29490609, "title": "A \u201ek\u00e1ll\u00f3i szent pap\u201c dala.

Unlike the World War II-era Latin American caricature she became in the United States, from 1929 to 1939 Carmen Miranda was a culturally influential and modern star in Brazil. Inspired by the Hollywood styles that she observed in imported films and that were featured in domestic magazines, Carmen Miranda became one of Brazil\u2019s first film stars, the nation\u2019s international \u2018Ambassador of Samba\u2019 and an important influence on modern understandings of brasilidade.

It is featured prominently in major moments of the Buddha\u2019s life story as the place of his birth, enlightenment, and death. It is also perceived as a place of fear, resistance, escape, sickness, spirits, danger, and temptation. In contrast to these negative attributes, the forest has been described as a place to encounter nature free from distractions; it embodies solitude, peace, and tranquility. How can one resolve these differing notions? Why does this ambivalence exist? How have all of these meanings changed over time?\r\nThis essay looks at the rhetoric of the forest in Buddhist thought by tracing the ambivalent attitudes of the forest within the P\u0101li canon, to meanings of the forest as described in popular Thai forest biographies, and finally to contemporary Buddhist writings, both from Thailand and Western countries. The P\u0101li canon suggests the best place to prac- tice is the natural world; it is isolating and challenging at first but soon can help transform the mind. The forest tradition of Thailand depicts the forest as more than just isolating, but rather dangerous and fearful. In contemporary times there is hardly any trace of the forest as a fear- ful place because it is instead depicted as sacred, and there is a feeling of merging with the natural world that aids awakening.\"\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30870581, "asset_id": 1994594, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 667733, "first_name": "Brooke", "last_name": "Schedneck", "domain_name": "rhodes", "page_name": "BrookeSchedneck", "display_name": "Brooke Schedneck", "profile_url": "https://rhodes.academia.edu/BrookeSchedneck?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/667733/233847/34206902/s65_brooke.schedneck.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 113, "name": "Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4345, "name": "Pali", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pali?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 25051, "name": "Theravada Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theravada_Buddhism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 48550, "name": "Religious Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 795101, "name": "Buddhism In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism_In_Thailand?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 77598116, "title": "Nikolaos Mantzaros and the Emergence of a Greek Composer (Durrell Studies 5)", "created_at": "2022-04-25T12:59:06.052-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77598116/Nikolaos_Mantzaros_and_the_Emergence_of_a_Greek_Composer_Durrell_Studies_5_?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_77598116", "summary": "Nikolaos Mantzaros (1795-1872) was the pre-eminent composer in the evolution of music according to the Western canon in modern Greece. This book is the first comprehensive study of his life and work to appear in English. It highlights the social and cultural context of Corfu (Mantzaros\u2019 birthplace), its transition from the Venetian administration to a European cultural realm in constant movement, its experience under the British Protectorate (1815-1864), and its annexation to the state of Greece. Mantzaros\u2019 central role as an educator and composer, his contribution to the musical use of Greek poetry and his development as a composer with strong initial affiliation to Italian musical thought are described in meticulous detail, while his reputation as the composer of Greece\u2019s national anthem is contrasted with his more esoteric work as a theorist, philosopher and pedagogue and his influence on future generations of Greek composers. At the same time, a comprehensive overview is offered regarding a society, whose significant part after 1850s decisively distanced itself from the common cultural area between Adriatic and Ionian Seas and the Italian peninsula, in order to follow the new ideological routes that came from the newly established Greek state and its quest for social and historical unity.\nSee

"work_36150345", "summary": "During the Middle Ages, the southern and south-western areas of the Voivodat of Transylvania and Kingdom of Hungary, respectively, represented a border region where several ethnic and confessional groups coexisted, each of them bringing into play its own cultural and religious tradition. Under Latin rule, Orthodox Romanians (Vlachs) lived together with Catholic Hungarians, Szeklers, and Saxons, their long-lasting convivencia generating frequent encounters with the culture of the Other, which left deep traces in the religious art of both confessional groups. Orthodox patrons had an entangled relationship with Western art, resorting often to masons active on the neighboring, Catholic sites, which created for them religious edifices with Western appearance. Although Orthodox patrons entrusted their churches\u2019 decoration mainly to painters of Byzantine tradition, these artists were highly receptive to themes and motifs typical for Western/Catholic iconography. Additionally, Orthodox patrons resorted sometimes to Western workshops for decorating their religious edifices with wall paintings. The article focuses on two case studies \u2013 the mural decoration of the sanctuaries of the neighboring Orthodox churches in Strei (Hunyad County, Voivodat of Transylvania) and H\u0103lmagiu (Arad County, Kingdom of Hungary), which was executed during the first half of the 14th century and  between the late-14th and early-15th century, respectively. When decorating the altar space of these Eastern-rite churches, the two Western workshops needed to adapt continuously their iconographic and formal vocabulary, in order to respond to the requirements of the particular worship space they decorated or to their commissioners\u2019 devotional sensibility and demands. This led to frequent phenomena of hybridization in the field of religious art, which escape the usual categories that history of medieval art operates with and which challenge traditional, art-historical labeling (e.g., Byzantine/Eastern versus Western or Orthodox versus Catholic).\n\n\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437

The paper further analyses the deployment of religion\r\nas a recurring theme. The older autochtonous Mexican religion and newer\r\nCatholicism create a hybrid which empowers the characters in this book.\r\nFinally, we focus on the author\u2019s use of parody and irony to tackle serious\r\nissues such as the status of women, tradition, religion, identity, crime and\r\nresponsibility.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55324793, "asset_id": 33815096, "asset_type": "Work",

"Negotiating human conditions is an emblematic critical impetus of diaspora informed by multiple cultural possibilities practiced through the creation of multiple spaces that cross the realm of the 'self' to that of the 'other'. It offers a locale to cross from the oppressed 'self' to an understanding of an oppressor 'other'. Yet, diasporic negotiation is politically involved in the most responsible manner; it engages the contextual social realities in order to enable creative possibilities for overcoming the logic of the politics altogether. It invites a kind of political involvement that assures the 'situatedness of the ethical' in a framework of moral humanistic realisations. The realisation of diasporic negotiations is dialogically engaged in manners that will give birth to new possibilities for human togetherness. In this essay, I trace the signs of diasporic negotiations of politics, love and trauma in Susan Abulhawa's Mornings in Jenin by focusing on the Diasporic identity of Amal (the central character). I consider the intersections between diaspora, dislocation of identity and the creation of negotiating spaces that qualify an 'epistemology of Diaspora' against essentialised and ethnocentric construction of realities. I argue that Abulhawa creates diasporic spaces and immense moral scenes to transcend a particular stance of politics via transcending love in opposition to suffering and tribulation. I contend that Abulhawa's conceptualisation of Diasporic negotiations enables her to depict and gauge two extreme human sentiments: love and trauma, yet, without yielding or compromising the right of just resistance and dissent.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43142002, "asset_id": 22527492, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5802055,

Differences with traditional Breton are discussed, as is the controversial nature of n\u00e9o-breton in the eyes of some commentators and native speakers.

Chinese Contemporary Art. 4.1. (2017) Nottingham, England: Intellect Books.\n\nSince the early 2000s many second-tier Chinese cities have begun to cultivate contemporary art scenes. \u00dcr\u00fcmchi, the capital city of the northwest province of Xinjiang, is no exception. Following Xi Jinping's announcement of the New Silk Road Economic Belt in 2013, a group of artists from the city received support from the Xinjiang Cultural Ministry to transform a decommissioned government building into the Xinjiang Contemporary Art Museum. Many of the exhibitions hosted in the space focus not only on themes of Silk Road revitalization but also representations of migration, frontier marginalization and the spectacle of rapid capitalist development. One outcome of this is the emergence of contemporary art rooted in the 'hybrid' traditions of Uyghur artists. In addition, a school of Han migrant documentary photography and figurative painting, which the art critic, curator and painter Zeng Qunkai has called 'black and white marginality', has begun to emerge.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57439045, "asset_id": 37470172, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3402002, "first_name": "Darren", "last_name": "Byler", "domain_name": "sfu", "page_name": "DarrenByler", "display_name": "Darren Byler", "profile_url": "https://sfu.academia.edu/DarrenByler?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3402002/1151576/40097613/s65_darren.byler.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7240, "name": "Silk Road Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Silk_Road_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 11344, "name": "Creative Industries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creative_Industries?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 12017, "name": "Xinjiang", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Xinjiang?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 12108, "name": "China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 16767, "name": "Modernism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modernism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 22832, "name": "Curatorial Practice (Art)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curatorial_Practice_Art_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 26558, "name": "Visual Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Arts?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 52385, "name": "Uyghurs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Uyghurs?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 34013170, "title": "Multicultural Identity: Conglomeration of Reader's ideology", "created_at": "2017-07-23T23:24:13.043-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34013170/Multicultural_Identity_Conglomeration_of_Readers_ideology?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_34013170", "summary": "Multiculturalism has added a new dimension to the reader's world. Culture becomes central to this new dimension of knowledge, in which the urge to prove one \" s identity requires intensive endurance. The problems of the minority nations have created a discourse among the fiction of V.S. Naipaul and Monica Ali. The issue draws an analogy between the Mikhail Bakhtin \" s concept of polyphony and multiple voices. In order to prevent the state from being fallen apart, Bhikhu Parekh recommends the practice of the plurality within diversity. Examining literary conditions, it has been significantly found that the formation of new perspectives towards the cultural diversity still exists.

the Yemeni Muslim community living in diaspora in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, through the ethnographic lens of the politics of religious and ethnic identity, with a particular focus on transnational and multiracial hybridity, and gender. Living in diaspora has created pressure both to identify as \u2018Yemeni\u2019 and to assimilate into Ethiopian society. Ethiopians and Yemenis in Ethiopia have discriminated against those considered not to be maintaining \u2018pure\u2019 ethnic or religious boundaries. The muwallad\u012bn, in particular, experience degrees of discrimination in the Yemeni community, due to perceptions that they are not \u2018pure-blooded Yemenis\u2019 or that they are simply inferior because they are black. Does this hybridity also create a space in which exclusionary definitions of culture and religion can be rejected? This study examines the factors working for and against assimilation for the Yemeni (chiefly \u1e24a\u1e0dram\u012b) and muwallad community in Addis Ababa, and the social opportunities and implications of their migration (or that of their ancestors), considering socio-religious class distinctions, political and economic contexts, and gender. It explores the ways in which they have established themselves, reimagined community, and redefined their identities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35365324, "asset_id": 7779935, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1325324, "first_name": "Sophia", "last_name": "Pandya", "domain_name": "csulb", "page_name": "SophiaPandya", "display_name": "Sophia Pandya", "profile_url": "https://csulb.academia.edu/SophiaPandya?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1325324/488577/11671363/s65_sophia.pandya.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2985, "name": "Ethiopian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethiopian_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15231, "name": "Yemen", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yemen?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16472, "name": "Transnational migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_migration?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 345856, "name": "Islam in Ethiopia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Ethiopia?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1462495, "name": "Muwallad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muwallad?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 1241149, "title": "\u2018The Journal Intime: From Document to Literary \u0152uvre in Andr\u00e9 Gide\u2019s Hybrid Works\u2019", "created_at": "2012-04-14T19:53:02.334-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1241149/_The_Journal_Intime_From_Document_to_Literary_%C5%92uvre_in_Andr%C3%A9_Gide_s_Hybrid_Works_?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_1241149", "summary": "The journal intime developed as a written form in France alongside the tradition of autobiography which emerged from Rousseau\u2019s Confessions; but the journal intime as a form that is published and read has a history of its own. It changed from being read in the 1880s principally as a source of documentary evidence to being acknowledged as a literary genre in 1939 upon the publication of Andr\u00e9 Gide\u2019s Journal 1889-1939, the first work by a living author to be included in Gallimard\u2019s prestigious Biblioth\u00e8que de la Pl\u00e9iade. I propose that, just as for autobiography, the history of the journal intime\u2019s accession to the status of literature involves fictional and hybrid forms as well as its \u2018real\u2019 form. Three works by Gide, each combining elements of fiction and non-fiction in innovative forms, contributed to this process: Les Cahiers d\u2019Andr\u00e9 Walter [The Notebooks of Andr\u00e9 Walter, 1891], Paludes [Swamps, 1895] and Le Journal des faux-monnayeurs [Journal of the Counterfeiters, [1926]. The works foreground different possibilities of the journal intime and bring together different ways of reading, sometimes in conflict, often creating unexpected harmonies. These examples invite discussion of the tension between documentary and literary uses of other types of first-person writing, and of the exchange between their real and fictional forms.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31125199, "asset_id": 1241149, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 77899, "first_name": "Sam", "last_name": "Ferguson", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SamFerguson22", "display_name": "Sam Ferguson", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SamFerguson22?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/77899/2758089/15801557/s65_sam.ferguson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68766, "name": "Andr\u00e9 Gide", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Andr%C3%A9_Gide?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 265526, "name": "Diary Writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diary_Writing?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 458189, "name": "Journal Intime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Journal_Intime?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 64995256, "title": "(mit Thomas Klinkert) Wirklichkeitsdarstellung in der italienischen und franz\u00f6sischen Gegenwartsnarrativik durch Hybridisierung von faktualem und fiktionalem Schreiben am Beispiel von Antonio Franchini und Y.

\tChitra Banerjee Divakaruni, born in India and currently residing in Houston, Texas, holds a distinct position among the postcolonial authors in diaspora who write about issues of immigration, hybridity and cross-pollination of cultures, because of her exploration of ancient myths and spiritual paradigms that she associates with contemporary concerns. Divakaruni\u2019s 1997 novel The Mistress of Spices was turned into a 2005 eponymous movie. The passage from one medium to another deeply affected the nature of mythical elements, symbols and archetypes as inscribed in the book. Raised in India, in a spiritual community lead by a wise \u201cMother\u201d, a young woman is magically transferred to a spice store in California, to serve the new community in a guise of an old woman. In the movie, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, an admired Indian actress and a former Miss Universe, plays the role of Tilo, the shopkeeper with magical powers. Catering to Western expectations of a romance, the film builds upon a rather stereotypical perception of an exotic beauty, a seductive initiator who falls in love with an American man. The novel, through the transformation of the heroine, suggests much more: in the midst of catastrophic circumstances, wisdom and compassion may still prevail.

A large number of rural burial grounds with early Christian graves has been excavated, making this region an ideal point of departure. But, the M\u00e4laren region is more than mere countryside. Here, we also find the town Sigtuna, founded c. 980, allowing us to distinguish between urban and rural burial practices. In urban environments, such as Sigtuna, early burials are relatively uniform and influenced by the Christian standard. At the same time, the situation in rural areas might be best described as \u201canything goes\u201d. This is usually attributed to a weak ecclesiastical organization. It seems plausible that the diversity seen in rural burials can be connected to the enormous production of rune stones during this period. Should rune stones, thus, be understood a sign of a society in crisis? The old ideology was strongly dependent on ancestral cult that tied individuals to particular farmsteads (o\u00f0al). A key question is whether religious hybridity also should be understood as a form of resistance, not against Christianity as such but against new Christian concepts that threatened this ancient o\u00f0al ideology \u2013 that is monarchy, the church and the individual ownership of land according to canon law. Recent archaeology provides many clues that might contribute to our new understanding of the Christianization of Scandinavia as a process of social change. Hence, individual changes in dress symbols, imagery and building structures, as well as changes in communications by land and sea do not only reflect change on an individual basis but on a greater scale. \n\nThe project\u00b4s starting-point is a boat grave in which a woman had been buried with dress adornments that (for untrained eyes) may seem generic for a 10th century burial. But a good scientist should never trust first impressions! Instead, the burial took place much later, in a time, when Christianity had been well established in the area. Nonetheless, the heirs chose to stage the burial in a pre-Christian style. The question is of course, why? Another question would be:  is this kind of retrospective burial practice a typical phenomenon during the introduction phase of Christianity in M\u00e4laren region? \n\nAs a theoretical framework, we are trying to implement the modern concept of hybridity. Thus, rather than identifying individuals as either Christian or Pagan, many of them should more properly be characterized as both! This new approach might contribute to our understanding of religious identity.\"\n\nOther papers from the project in the same publication:\n\nGunilla Larsson.

warfare\u2019 proved to be very popular among academics, military thinkers and professionals leading to a variety of de\ufb01nitions and approaches. It was linked with the new generation concept popularised by Russian military thought. Th e essence of the hybridity is not new, as using a combination of military and non-military instruments is as old as mankind and is recognised but interpreted di\ufb00erently. The paper examines both the concept and its implementation based on case studies and theoretical considerations. It debates possible ways of using it to confront targeted nations by a combination of a variety of tools and approaches.

Utilizing excavated memory, archival history, and employing the work of performance and postcolonial theorists, the author examines Native American slavery and captivity in the Spanish Colonial Southwest, with emphasis on Coyotes (indigenous mixed-bloods) of Pueblo/Spanish ancestry as well as descendants of Indigenous servants. The essays engage the cultural politics of education within the context of hybrid religious practices such as pilgrimages to el Cerro de Tepeyac, the site of veneration of the pre-Columbian Goddess Tonanztin and her contemporary, la Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe; el Santuario de Chimayo, the pre-Hispanic Tewa religious site that continues to serve as the destination for pilgrims, albeit now draped in Catholic ritual; and the Comanche dance ceremony of the Saracino sisters of Atrisco. The essays emerge in part from the author\u2019s childhood in the Barelas and Atrisco neighborhoods of Albuquerque, two of several mixed-blood indigenous communities of New Mexico plagued by a devastating heroin epidemic in the 1950s and 60s.\n\n\n\u201cBernardo Gallegos has produced a stunning achievement. Postcolonial Indigenous Performances: Coyote Musings on Gen\u00edzaros, Hybridity, Education, and Slavery is an emotionally gripping, beautifully written, and intellectually captivating page turner that theorizes the \u2018Gen\u00edzaro story\u2019 in a way that brings the genocidal underpinnings of the colonial agenda to light.\u201d \u2013 Angela Valenzuela, College of Education, University of Texas at Austin\n\n\nPostcolonial Indigenous Performances: Coyote Musings on Gen\u00edzaros, Hybridity, Education, and Slavery is a brilliant expression of complexities, contours, and nuances of indigenous lived experience. It is told through the eyes and the being of Bernardo Gallegos, who lived inside that experience, knowing the ghosts of its distant past and relationships of its recent present.\u201d \u2013 William H. Schubert, Professor Emeritus of Curriculum and Instruction and former University Scholar, University of Illinois at Chicago\n\n\n\u201cThis beautifully written book shows how the past horrors of Native American subjugation and enslavement can haunt the lives of their descendants. Bernardo Gallegos\u2019 superb research and personal narrative tells the story of colonial New Mexico and the resulting psychological damage on future generations. I\u2019m still haunted by the effect on me of the Choctaw march on the Trail of Tears.\u201d \u2013 Joel Spring, City University of New York", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53474609, "asset_id": 33422908, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 252727, "first_name": "Bernardo", "last_name": "Gallegos", "domain_name": "national", "page_name": "BernardoGallegos", "display_name": "Bernardo  Gallegos", "profile_url": "https://national.academia.edu/BernardoGallegos?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/252727/54086/19762154/s65_bernardo.gallegos.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 299, "name": "Native American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Native_American_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6283, "name": "History of Slavery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Slavery?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9043, "name": "Performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13995, "name": "Postcolonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 19495, "name": "Indigenous Peoples", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Peoples?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 33832, "name": "History of Indigenous Peoples", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Indigenous_Peoples?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 46350, "name": "Genizaros", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genizaros?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1497543, "name": "Coyotes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coyotes?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 29683137, "title": "\u201cThe Yellow Hybrids: Gender and Genre in Gilman\u2019s Wallpaper,\u201d Short Story Theories: A XXIst Century Perspective.

During the fourth millennium B.C. northern Mesopotamian sites reveal widespread distribution of southern Uruk-style material cultural elements along with indigenous styles.  Recent archaeological research on the problem has suggested that interregional interactions in the form of exchange relationships, movement of people and establishment of trade colonies resulted in the blending of multiple cultural practices. Through architectural analysis, I particularly investigate the active role of individuals and groups in the creation of hybrid material culture.  Diachronic and comparative analysis of architectural organization and use of space traces the transfer and re-contextualization of different traditions, and detects hybrid and non-hybrid practices that communicate both canonical (common architectural conventions that reflect larger socio-cosmic principles) and indexical messages (the particular status of inhabitants).  An eclectic concept of hybridity is applied in this study that takes theoretical elements from the postcolonial concept of hybridity, and the concepts of syncretism and cultural integration.",

I explore the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of blackness and final rejection of European identity common to Twain\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s novels. In Twain\u2019s novel, the familiar figure of \u201cthe tragic mulatto\u201d is juxtaposed with, and temporarily supplanted by, the more unexpected figure of the tragic immigrant, an outsider who can never become an assimilated American.

One of the most striking feature of the black British poet is his irony, which functions as an effective revolutionary act as it subtly reveals hypocrisies and prejudices. Benjamin Zephaniah\u2019s subversive use of language is aimed at opening the boundaries of the literary canon and of the very idea of Britishness, in the same way as postcolonial authors do. Being himself a \u2018product\u2019 of cultural hybridisation, Benjamin Zephaniah creates a syncretic network of intermingled voices and personae, a sort of polyphony in Bakhtinian terms. Therefore, his poetics bears resemblance to \u00c9douard Glissant\u2019s idea of \u2018creolisation\u2019, according to which every identity is in fact a mixture, which is \u2018happily\u2019 and inevitably changing through a relationship with the Other.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63096169, "asset_id": 42858098, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 73688462, "first_name": "Cristina", "last_name": "Pezzolesi", "domain_name": "urbinoc", "page_name": "CristinaPezzolesi", "display_name": "Cristina Pezzolesi", "profile_url": "https://urbinoc.academia.edu/CristinaPezzolesi?f_ri=4138", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19425, "name": "Polyphony", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Polyphony?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 110988, "name": "Irony", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irony?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1125509, "name": "Postcolonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonialism?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 27036092, "title": "Post-Agreement Northern Irish Literature:  Lost in a Liminal Space?", "created_at": "2016-07-17T01:46:16.088-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27036092/Post_Agreement_Northern_Irish_Literature_Lost_in_a_Liminal_Space?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_27036092", "summary": "This book uncovers a new genre of \u2018post-Agreement literature\u2019, consisting of a body of texts \u2013 fiction, poetry and drama \u2013 by Northern Irish writers who grew up during the Troubles and published their work in the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement. In an attempt to demarcate the literary-aesthetic parameters of the genre, the book proposes a selective revision of postcolonial theories on \u2018liminality\u2019 through a subset of concepts such as \u2018negative liminality\u2019, \u2018liminal suspension\u2019 and \u2018liminal permanence.\u2019 These conceptual interventions, as the readings demonstrate, help articulate how the

Concerning the anthropomorphic ones, the high frequency of female figures has been exaggeratedly emphasized, although not necessarily in a flattering way, mainly in the past, while the very small percentage of clearly male figures is equally problematic. At the same time, besides these examples which reflect the biological dimorphism, in impressively numerous cases the morphology of the figurines does not permit their classification in a definite sex, while, exceptionally, features of both sexes are specified on ambiguous anthropomorphic representations. \r\n\tThe criteria for the choice regarding either the indication, suggestion or emphasis, or the concealment of the biological sex, as well as regarding preferences when sex is revealed, remain unknown, in spite of various hypotheses that have been expressed. The fact that there is evidence about a \"third\" or even a \u201cfourth\u201d sex/gender, which does not partake in the biological distinctions, could be interpreted in several alternative ways: -either the visibility of anatomic morphology was in certain cases inconsequential, self-evident, beside the point, or irrelevant; -or the difference emerged from other characteristics; -or a different category of social beings was implied; -or it was preferred to show a flexible multiplicity of meanings or an indefinite existence instead of an explicit -accomplished or constrained- gender-defined identity. \r\n\tIn an effort to proceed beyond simple visual impressions and a \"literal\" reading of genders, in parallel to exploring visible at first level and apparently invisible elements, it is attempted to consider as broadly as possible the general and the more specific frameworks in which the prehistoric representations had functioned, as well as their possible approaches.

Cependant, alors que Les Mains d\u2019Orlac relate l\u2019histoire d\u2019une double greffe de mains, une chirurgie aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 notre port\u00e9e, Le\u00a0Docteur Lerne pousse plus loin la question de l\u2019hybridit\u00e9, en partant de la greffe v\u00e9g\u00e9tale pour passer au m\u00e9lange v\u00e9g\u00e9tal-animal et animal-humain, et m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019hybridit\u00e9 humain-machine. Par ailleurs, un des int\u00e9r\u00eats du romancier Maurice Renard est son propre travail de th\u00e9orisation d\u2019un genre qu\u2019il d\u00e9nommait \u00ab\u00a0merveilleux-scientifique\u00a0\u00bb.

Le merveilleux-scientifique n\u2019incarne donc ni une stricte volont\u00e9 d\u2019anticipation, ni une pure \u00e9vasion du r\u00e9el, mais une fa\u00e7on particuli\u00e8re \u2014\u00a0requ\u00e9rant la fiction de l\u2019avanc\u00e9e technique ou de la rupture \u00e9pist\u00e9mologique\u00a0\u2014 d\u2019explorer le va-et-vient entre les possibles de la science et de la r\u00eaverie. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, Le\u00a0Docteur\u00a0Lerne fait feu de tout bois.

"Spanglish, the so-called \u201chybrid\u201d language resulting from prolonged bilingualism and linguistic contact, is spoken by millions of Americans. Nevertheless its use is not encouraged by most publishers, educational institutions, or media; instead they encourage US Latinxs to write in English or Spanish. However, in the late 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s there was a boom of authors, musicians, and some academics to rebel against this trend and publish works in Spanglish, usually in academic or independent presses. \n\nThis rise in literary production in Spanglish birthed an interest in translation into this vernacular. Every indication would lead us to believe that the first Spanglish translation was Ilan Stavans\u2019 2003 publication of the first chapter of Don Quixote, to which the title of this presentation makes reference. As such Stavans\u2019 work was both ground-breaking and controversial; while few reviews of his work have been published, the ones that have generally focus on two concerns: the illegitimacy of Spanglish as a literary language, and the fact that Stavans\u2019 translations do not always replicate in writing the way that Spanglish is actually used. Though many critique, either in print or in conversation, very few have considered the important contribution of this work to the development of Spanglish as a literary language. \n\nIn this paper I will consider how Stavans\u2019 translation of Don Quixote increased prestige of Spanglish by making it, for the first time, a translating language. I will go on to explore how the lexicon and literary devises required to translate this work contributed significantly to the Spanglish polysystem. I will conclude by explaining the symbolic importance of making Don Quixote the first of these translations.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60825088, "asset_id": 36702400, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1765480, "first_name": "Remy", "last_name": "Attig", "domain_name": "bgsu", "page_name": "RemyAttig", "display_name": "Remy Attig", "profile_url": "https://bgsu.academia.edu/RemyAttig?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1765480/605142/59838153/s65_remy.attig.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 298, "name": "Latino/A Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latino_A_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1186, "name": "Translation Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2940, "name": "Latina/o Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latina_o_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 33860, "name": "Spanglish", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spanglish?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 35524742, "title": "Kristupas Sabolius.

It offers an empirical reading of the films' movement and contextualizes them historically to move on to a theory of medium informed by Deleuze, Levinson, and Rajewsky. How does Rainer's move from the time-based media of dance and choreography, and Serra's move from the object arts of painting and sculpture, into the medium of film, advance our understanding of what is at stake aesthetically when boundaries of media are dissolved, transited, or displaced? Dance aesthetics requires that we show how movement gets translated into medium. I propose that the movement of media creates a displacement that is parallel to the displacement from the empirical to the theoretical in this article, where displacement becomes a form of reflection and critique.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53435410, "asset_id": 33379467, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7035285, "first_name": "Kyle",

In the context of Roma-related scholarship, \u2018methodological Eurocentrism\u2019 refers to analyses of the Roma\u2019s societal position that do not sufficiently take into account how representations of both Europe and the Roma have significantly and interdependently changed since the collapse of socialism. Since the fall of communism, we have been able to observe what I call the \u2018Europeanization of the representation of the Roma\u2019, that is, firstly, the post-1989 problematization of the Roma in terms of their Europeanness and European identity; secondly, the classification of heterogeneous groups scattered over Europe under the umbrella term Roma and, thirdly, the devising of Europe-wide developmental programs that are dedicated to their inclusion, integration, anti-discrimination, empowerment and participation.\n\nI will clarify how we can understand the Europeanization of Roma representation as the latest stage of the various ways in which those who are currently called, or call themselves, Roma have historically interacted with Europe. I argue that, since 1989, a shift has taken place from considering the Roma as the Orientalized and externalized outsiders against which Europe has defined itself to considering them as the internalized outsiders to be incorporated in Europe as productive, participating and \u2018true Europeans\u2019. This shift has enabled the Roma to become actively involved in the political and policy debates about their representation, in attempts at improving their situation, and in the deepening and widening of the heterogeneous Romani movement. Yet, I will explain why this shift is fundamentally ambiguous. It has contributed to problematizing the Roma in ambiguous ways at the present-day nexus of security, citizenship and development. I will show how a threefold redirecting of Roma-related scholarship will help to critically reflect upon these problematizations beyond currently dominant Eurocentric and Roma-centric parameters.",

Evidence is taken primarily from a corpus of Revived Manx speech and writing. The observed features of Revived Manx are situated within Zuckermann&#39;s (2009, 2020) framework of \u2018hybridization\u2019 and \u2018revival linguistics\u2019, which takes Israeli Hebrew as the prototypical model of revernacularization of a non-L1 language. However, Manx arguably provides a more typical example of what to expect when a revived minority language remains predominantly an L2 for an indefinite period, with each new cohort of speakers able to reshape the target variety in the absence of a firmly established L1 norm.

It analyses a Caribbean Negro, Makak's quest for 'home' and identity in a colonized multicultural West Indies. Living on the island, he feels excluded from the sense of belongingness to the land and he is subjugated by White colonizers due to his fact of blackness. Hence, he develops a desire for home and considers Africa as his land of origin. After return to roots, he feels himself a misfit in that culture and thus home becomes a place of no-return. The exploratory and explanatory approaches have adopted for this research paper. Therefore, it is qualitative in nature rather than quantitative. Its groundings are laid on postcolonial diaspora theory. They have strong feelings of attachment to their \"homeland\" (Safran)..

Pouss\u00e9e par le d\u00e9sir de corriger la lecture erron\u00e9e \u2013 prise comme telle par les historiens de l\u2019art \u2013 d\u2019une inscription r\u00e9cemment d\u00e9couverte, l\u2019\u00e9tude est devenue un examen critique des informations donn\u00e9es par les textes slavons conserv\u00e9s dans l\u2019\u00e9glise : de l\u2019inscription de la peinture votive, des inscriptions de nature votive de l\u2019au-dessus et du voisinage imm\u00e9diat de l\u2019image de Saint Jean-Baptiste (toutes les trois dans le registre inf\u00e9rieur de la paroi sud du naos) et d\u2019une inscription r\u00e9cemment d\u00e9couverte (dans la partie nord de la vo\u00fbte de l\u2019autel, entre les repr\u00e9sentations de deux \u00e9vang\u00e9listes assis). Le caract\u00e8re fragmentaire de ces inscriptions et l\u2019examen critique de leur contenu ne permettent que de formuler des hypoth\u00e8ses au sujet de la datation de l\u2019ensemble des peintures murales : que ces hypoth\u00e8ses soient confirm\u00e9es ou non, nous allons le savoir lors de l\u2019ach\u00e8vement des travaux de d\u00e9capage, de nettoyage et de restauration des fresques. Le d\u00e9tail de la peinture votive avec l\u2019indication de la date chronologique lue par Silviu Dragomir comme l\u2019ann\u00e9e 6925 (=1417) ne figure pas dans la photo d\u2019avant 1930 qui accompagne son \u00e9tude. L\u2019historien roumain s\u2019est probablement bas\u00e9 sur la transcription de l\u2019inscription faite en 1869-1870 par le pr\u00eatre de Ribi\u0163a, juste un an avant la publication par \u00d6d\u00f6n Nemes des informations \u00e0 propos des fondateurs de l\u2019\u00e9glise et des inscriptions indiquant l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1404. L\u2019ann\u00e9e de l\u2019inscription fragmentaire de l\u2019autel n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 conserv\u00e9e, mais des informations qui existent encore semblent indiquer l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1393 \u00e9tant la date \u00e0 laquelle on a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 au moins la d\u00e9coration murale de l\u2019autel, sinon toute la peinture de l\u2019\u00e9glise (seule la fin de la restauration des fresques peut apporter des preuves claires et concluantes pour avancer une formule plus pr\u00e9cise au sujet des \u00e9tapes de la d\u00e9coration). L\u2019examen \u00e9pigraphique et pal\u00e9ographique des peintures et des textes de l\u2019\u00e9glise ont indiqu\u00e9 l\u2019existence d\u2019au moins deux \u00ab mains \u00bb individuelles: l\u2019inscription votive et les inscriptions avoisin\u00e9es aux images des saints rois hongrois se distinguent \u00e0 la fois entre elles et par rapport aux autres inscriptions de l\u2019\u00e9glise. Les informations fournies par les quatre inscriptions au caract\u00e8re votif ont conduit \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle l\u2019ensemble des peintures murales a \u00e9t\u00e9 mat\u00e9rialis\u00e9 par la volont\u00e9 de plusieurs donateurs qui ont contribu\u00e9 financi\u00e8rement (\u00e0 hauteurs diff\u00e9rentes !) simultan\u00e9ment ou cons\u00e9cutivement : ce qui imprime un caract\u00e8re cumulatif \u00e0 l\u2019acte fondateur \u2013 chose loin d\u2019\u00eatre isol\u00e9e dans les cas des Pays du Cri\u015f et du Ha\u0163eg.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55853184, "asset_id": 35969843, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 725693, "first_name": "Dragos Gh.", "last_name": "Nastasoiu", "domain_name": "nec-ro", "page_name": "DragosGhNastasoiu", "display_name": "Dragos Gh.

Questo filone di studi focalizza sulla definizione delle molteplici e interconnesse identit\u00e0 etniche presenti all\u2019interno di quella generale Ellenica, studiandone sia i processi di formazione, sia le dinamiche storiche. L\u2019identit\u00e0 etnica \u00e8 stata ri-definita come un prodotto culturale, ma anche uno strumento d\u2019indagine: ovvero fondata sulla condivisione di un\u2019ascendenza comune, consolidata dalla trasmissione di tradizioni mitiche e cultuali, e dell\u2019appartenenza territoriale; la portata di questa definizione in senso culturale, implica che l\u2019etnicit\u00e0 \u00e8 un elemento costruito e negoziabile, modificabile, soggetto alle necessit\u00e0 socio-politiche del gruppo e caratterizzato da propri sviluppi diacronici. L\u2019identit\u00e0 etnica si lega dunque alle dinamiche della storia sociale e politica della Grecia antica.\r\nL\u2019identit\u00e0 etnica ha la propria funzione principale nel rapportare la comunit\u00e0 con altri gruppi etnici, sociali o politici, al suo esterno: \u00e8 uno strumento dunque delle relazioni interstatali. In questa prospettiva, le forme di auto-rappresentazione etnica, e pi\u00f9 in genere identitaria, trovano la loro espressione nelle aree di frontiera in quanto zone di contatto: i processi di antropizzazione e la stabilizzazione in territori marginali e, soprattutto, l\u2019incontro \u2013 o lo scontro \u2013 fra gruppi diversi e la residenza in spazi condivisi porta a ridefinire le identit\u00e0.\r\nSu questi presupposti ci si propone dunque di riflettere su alcuni elementi selezionati della storia del Chersoneso Tracico nella seconda met\u00e0 del VI secolo a.C. In questo contesto storico-geografico \u00e8 possibile osservare dinamiche di de-territorializzazione e ri-definizione di un territorio condiviso. Il soggetto storico \u00e8 un case-study per riflettere sul contatto e negoziazione di interessi fra gruppi etnici distinti (poleis elleniche della regione, preesistenti colonie eoliche, nuovi coloni ateniesi, popolazioni locali di Traci e anche l\u2019influenza dell\u2019impero di Lidia). La proposta analitica conclude osservando una tendenza alla coabitazione pacifica o organizzata; soprattutto si evidenzia la formazione di un\u2019identit\u00e0 comune trans-etnica locale \u2013 emergono anzi diversi indirizzi di consolidamento identitario, privilegiati in momenti distinti e da gruppi sociali distinti nella penisola; in queste forme di creazione identitaria si possono

This dissertation focused on a refined set of eight components of wisdom through research designed to explore if, how, and when they are invoked by a group of experts participating in a futures discussion about organizations in their field of practice, American higher education. The aim was to explore a set of wisdom-centered design principles (denoted as Wise By Design [WBD]) for social innovation, specifically in the design of organizations that would thrive in the future. After four rounds of engagement with a panel of experts with approximately 500 years of accumulated experience in the field, six conclusions were reached: a) an organization could be seen as wise; if leadership, management, and innovation practices are augmented by wisdom; b) the use of design principles based on wisdom and futures inquiry could help organizations develop wise processes; c) wise people develop the ability to take an objectivized balanced perspective when confronted with situations, decisions, or requests for advice; d) wisdom could be described as a multi-channel sense-and-respond adaptive system with the higher purpose of flourishing of self and others; e) interoperability and dual hybridity, both administrative and academic, could enable institutions of higher education to thrive in the future; and f) this field of research could lead into a discussion on the value of exploring artificial wisdom.

In the traditional vernacular of Chinese society, linglei refers to \u201cthe other species\u201d or \u201cthe other kind\u201d whose behavior deviates substantially from the norm. However, the term linglei has been used with increasing frequency in Chinese popular culture over the past several years, which has dramatically modified its meaning in everyday discourse.  Indeed, a growing number of \u201chip\u201d Chinese young people proudly identify as linglei, thus seeking to reframe the concept as a \u201cnew culture of cool.\u201d  Drawing on ethnographic interviews and observations conducted by the author in Beijing, Shanghai, and other cities, the chapter analyzes the innovative discourse of young people involved in the negotiation and reconstruction of the Chinese \u201cother.\u201d  The subjective symbolic meanings that Chinese youth attach to linglei and related subcultural terms such yaogun yinue (\u201crock music\u201d), xin xin renlei (\u201cnew new human beings\u201d), and pengke (\u201cpunk\u201d), and are explored.  The chapter examines research questions such as the following: What is the symbolic meaning of linglei and related subcultural terms to teens and young adults in contemporary China?  How have Chinese music, literature, films, and other facets of popular culture influenced the evolution and reframing of linglei?  Why do some Chinese young people have a favorable impression of linglei, while others react with suspicion or distain towards this \u201calternative lifestyle\u201d?  \r\n",

The ideologies indexed by this proverb are salient in the many Pacific societies whose people weave, plait, felt, beat, and otherwise construct textiles, many of whom our authors discuss in this special issue of Pacific Arts. The papers collected here document the ways in which, through textile arts, Pacific humankind \u2018weave\u2019 themselves, in the contexts of colonial, and more importantly, post-colonial and decolonizing eras. Recognizing the importance of practical, local motivations and inspiration for Pacific peoples\u2019 arts, we identify in these creative endeavors both \u2018hybridity\u2019 and what we refer to as \u2018pragmatic creativity\u2019.

Tra la fine dell\u2019Ottocento e gli inizi del Novecento, appaiono scritture saggistiche che valicano i confini del tradizionale saggio critico e ambiscono a partecipare alla dimensione della letterariet\u00e0, al pari del romanzo e della poesia. Tramite diverse strategie di camuffamento, gli pseudo-saggi si diffondono in Europa e negli Stati Uniti, dimostrando una capacit\u00e0 di metamorfosi che consente loro di rinnovarsi e giungere fino a oggi. Il volume studia le varie combinazioni tra il saggio critico e altre pratiche di scrittura, come il dialogo, l\u2019autoritratto, la biografia romanzesca, la riscrittura parafinzionale e l\u2019autobiografia, e individua nella tensione tra il commento dei testi e l\u2019invenzione creativa, tra l\u2019interpretazione e l\u2019immaginazione una nuova possibilit\u00e0 artistica per il saggio critico, anche ibridandosi con i media visivi e andando oltre il testo scritto, come nel caso del video essay.\r\n\r\n***\r\nFollowing my dissertation and series of articles, my 10-year research on the genre of the essay has been achieved in my book Pseudo-saggi. (Ri)Scritture e critica letteraria. Here, I develop the original idea of the pseudo-essay: a literary form of the critical essay. Through different strategies of camouflage, the pseudo-essays spread throughout Europe and the United States, and they experience various metamorphosis in combination with the dialogue, self-portrait, fictional biography, para-fictional rewriting and autobiography. Finally, the pseudo-essay represents an artistic attempt to keep together the commentary of the texts and the creative invention, interpretation and imagination, by also hybridizing the criticism with visual media and going beyond the written text, as in the case of the video essay.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 88787444, "asset_id": 40365092, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4261026, "first_name": "Guido Mattia", "last_name": "Gallerani", "domain_name": "unibo", "page_name": "GuidoMattiaGallerani", "display_name": "Guido Mattia Gallerani", "profile_url": "https://unibo.academia.edu/GuidoMattiaGallerani?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4261026/1690731/33651419/s65_guido_mattia.gallerani.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 659, "name": "Comparative Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Literature?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5175, "name": "Dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dialogue?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7297, "name": "Autobiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Autobiography?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7351, "name": "Fictionality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fictionality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7888, "name": "Literary Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 8265, "name": "Biography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biography?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 8536, "name": "Hybridization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridization?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 14614, "name": "Sociology of Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Literature?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 16499, "name": "Genre Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genre_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 21488, "name": "Self Portraiture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_Portraiture?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 33162, "name": "Essay (Genre Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Essay_Genre_Theory_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 35923, "name": "Autofiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Autofiction?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 90831, "name": "Essays", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Essays?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 103487, "name": "History and theory of literary genres", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_and_theory_of_literary_genres?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 110420, "name": "Rewriting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rewriting?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 123811, "name": "Metatextuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Metatextuality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 144638, "name": "Essay Writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Essay_Writing?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 297281, "name": "ESSAI", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ESSAI?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 588708, "name": "Video Essay", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Video_Essay?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 39977209, "title": "LIVING, WORKING AND TRAVELLING New Processes of Hybridization for the Spaces of Hospitality and Work edited by", "created_at": "2019-07-31T02:50:13.349-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39977209/LIVING_WORKING_AND_TRAVELLING_New_Processes_of_Hybridization_for_the_Spaces_of_Hospitality_and_Work_edited_by?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_39977209", "summary": "The research project titled \"Living, working, travelling: Interior design for new scenarios between hospitality and work field\", financed by FARB Fondo Ateneo Ricerca di Base of the Design Department-Politecnico di Milano 2015-2016, started from the assumption that in the contemporary society we witness both physical and virtual \"mobile lives\" (Elliot, Urry, 2010). This attitude involves new concepts related to the design of the spaces that are investigated in the book trough researches and didactic activities in order to define new ways of living, working and travelling, and to identify which kind of spaces are generated by the contemporary transformations. The research explores and describes these new spatial models with the specific approach of the design of interiors, focused on the space but also on the processes and systems of relationships between spaces-furniture-services and communication methods. During the research, developed by the research team, coordinated by prof. Francesco Scullica: Veronese, the focus is mainly on the relationship and the hybridization processes between hospitality spaces (mainly hotels and hostels) and workspa-ces for knowledge worker (offices, smart-office, co-working, hubs) in the field of interior design.

Questi i termini con cui Virginia Woolf nel suo saggio The Narrow Bridge of Art tenta di dar conto dell\u2019innegabile fascino esercitato dal magnum opus di Laurence Sterne. La \u2018prosivendola\u2019 di Bloomsbury sta riflettendo sulle possibilit\u00e0 che il medium della prosa offre a chi voglia farne la primaria forma di espressione letteraria. Le implicazioni teoriche che la riflessione sul Tristram innesca sono notevoli: che anche nella prosa esista una marcata qualit\u00e0 poetica? Che il romanzo possa davvero essere luogo dove \u00abthere is room [\u2026] for story-telling,\r\nfor comedy, for tragedy, for criticism and information and philosophy and poetry\u00bb (\u00abThe Poets\u00bb, Granite and Rainbow)? Il discorso non interessa solo il romanzo: il caso Woolf \u00e8 in toto\r\nemblematico. Se \u00e8 vero che ogni sua opera tende ad essere ibridazione di pi\u00f9 stilemi provenienti da generi diversi, \u00e8 anche vero che una comune vena lirica pervade ogni suo letterario: le pi\u00f9 evidenti (fosse anche solo graficamente) sono le sezioni proemiali ai singoli segmenti narrativi di The Waves, in cui il moto del Sole \u00e8 messo in relazione diretta con le vicissitudini dei sei personaggi in scena. Come notava uno dei primi recensori di The Years, la prosa woolfiana necessita di un \u00abclose and leisurly reading, like a long poem\u00bb. Il mio contributo vorrebbe mettere in relazione questa \u2018ibridazione della prosa\u2019 tramite i giudizi critici che Woolf espresse su Sterne nei suoi saggi: se di norma Sterne \u00e8 modello dell\u2019antiromanziere, per Woolf diviene anche colui che sotto la maschera dell\u2019umorismo e della parodia, riesce ad infarcire di poesia la sua prosa.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53134730, "asset_id": 19704705, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2792488, "first_name": "Paolo", "last_name": "Bugliani", "domain_name": "uniroma2", "page_name": "PaoloBugliani", "display_name": "Paolo Bugliani", "profile_url": "https://uniroma2.academia.edu/PaoloBugliani?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2792488/914163/89805663/s65_paolo.bugliani.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3581, "name": "Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poetry?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8452, "name": "Virginia Woolf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Virginia_Woolf?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 62052, "name": "Laurence Sterne", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Laurence_Sterne?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1029531, "name": "Poetic and Experimental Prose", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poetic_and_Experimental_Prose?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 14713899, "title": "Chronology and Use of Guatemalan Maiolica: Ceramics as Reducci\u00f3n in the Izalcos Region of El Salvador", "created_at": "2015-08-06T05:57:04.282-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14713899/Chronology_and_Use_of_Guatemalan_Maiolica_Ceramics_as_Reducci%C3%B3n_in_the_Izalcos_Region_of_El_Salvador?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_14713899", "summary": "Maiolica (tin-enameled earthenware) was a staple of daily\nlife for serving food and drink, as well as other household\npurposes, in Spain and Spanish America throughout the\ncolonial period.

"This article critically engages with the politics of the gaze and the melodramatic mode in Nessa no chikai/Vow in the Desert (Watanabe, 1940). Staged in the Chinese mainland during the Second Sino-Japanese war (1937\u20131945), this adventure-melodrama film features \u2018border-crossing\u2019 multilingual actress Yamaguchi Yoshiko (aka Li Xianglan or Ri K\u014dran) and the Japanese male star Hasegawa Kazuo. Japan\u2019s cultural adaptation to western hegemony through technology, i.e. \u2018modernization\u2019, was a hybrid process and interconnected with similar endeavours by their counterparts in the Chinese mainland. I argue that the film was a site for Japanese film-makers to assert their entitlement to modern technology in general, and the cinematic gaze in particular. While architectural metaphors and actors\u2019 bodies anchor the phantasm of modernized national self, the gaze at the actress\u2019s body is orchestrated so as to blur national identities and mediate film spectators\u2019 longing for whiteness and the West.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30587357, "asset_id": 2576912, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

With great luck, I was able to connect with Suh in my planned trip to Gwangju when I went to research the massacre of May 18th, 1980. The following interview helps me to better understand the term \u201cdiaspora\u201d in the context of Korean-North American hybrid identity. I learned that there is a difference between Suh\u2019s first-generation Korean-American experiences of hybridity and my second-generation Korean-Canadian experience of hybrid identity. Interestingly, Suh has noticed that the trend in mobility of going back and forth between places renders identity more fluid and dynamic in an increasingly globalized world. This flow between cultures materialized in his installation of the art piece Home Within Home, where his work is the result of having to process his new surroundings between one place and another by fabricating his dwelling sculpturally.

The Bengali-speaking elites and subalterns, in their own ways, delighted in being considered 'kh\u0101dya-rasik'-s (gourmets, connoisseurs of the 'rasa'-s implicit in food, bordering on gluttony) and capable of hybridising 'bileti' (<vil\u0101yati=foreign, European) dishes to suit their epicurean and/or eclectic tastes. This meant that the mid-nineteenth-century English workers' staple 'fish and chips', itself a hybrid fashioned from the original 'pescados fritos' by the Iberian Marrano-s as early as the sixteenth century and first made into a commercial success, in 1860, by \u201cJoseph Malin, a Jewish immigrant newly arrived from Eastern Europe,\u201d became the 'fish-fry' that is one of Bengal's favourite heavy snacks. This paper looks at the ways in which mid- and late-colonial Bengali society practised culinary hybridisation, the products of which were cherished by the hybrid-figure of the Bengali detective, and the extent to which the modern Bengali palate is a composite, even cosmopolitan one.

By drawing insights from 'everyday cosmopolitanism' we examine how hybrid identities both facilitate and undermine capacities to overcome difference and alter the power dynamics within social worlds. This demonstrates that everyday cosmopolitanism is not easily achieved but rather oscillates around strategies for fitting in that sometimes reinforce uneven social positions. We argue for caution in accounts of the 1.5 generation and recognition of the ways that cosmopolitanism is socially situated, subject to the multiple pressures, and enacted within the uneven power relations of society.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44052812, "asset_id": 23642123, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2863486, "first_name": "Bingyu", "last_name": "Wang", "domain_name": "nankai", "page_name": "BingyuWang", "display_name": "Bingyu Wang", "profile_url": "https://nankai.academia.edu/BingyuWang?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2863486/943945/59919034/s65_bingyu.wang.jpeg"}, {"id": 2721247, "first_name": "Francis L.", "last_name": "Collins", "domain_name": "waikato", "page_name": "FrancisLCollins", "display_name": "Francis L.

examines the global diffusion of Black Lives Matter as digitally networked connective action. Combining social network analysis with qualitative textual analysis, we show that BLM was hybridized in different ways to give voice to local struggles for social justice in Brazil, India, and Japan. However, BLM's hybridization stirred rightwing backlash within these countries that not only targeted local movements but BLM too. Theoretically, we argue that both transnational contiguities and intra-cultural tensions shape the construction of meanings-or 'action frames'-as connective action crosses cultural borders. Resonant frames, which are in harmony with the values of the movement, amplify features of the global movement that resonate with local concerns or hybridize it with a local struggle. Reactionary frames, which are hostile to movement values, may also target the global movement or its hybridization. We theorize the different roles of global and local crowd-enabled elites in transnational connective action.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 72751224, "asset_id": 58083948, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 73570, "first_name": "Saif", "last_name": "Shahin", "domain_name": "tilburguniversity", "page_name": "SaifShahin", "display_name": "Saif Shahin", "profile_url": "https://tilburguniversity.academia.edu/SaifShahin?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/73570/2828204/73864966/s65_saif.shahin.jpg"}, {"id": 105913990, "first_name": "Junki", "last_name": "Nakahara", "domain_name": "american", "page_name": "JunkiNakahara", "display_name": "Junki Nakahara", "profile_url": "https://american.academia.edu/JunkiNakahara?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/105913990/24311944/41978618/s65_junki.nakahara.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 208, "name": "Social Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Movements?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 859, "name": "Communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communication?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 928, "name": "Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 933, "name": "New Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Media?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2869, "name": "Digital Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Media?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7369, "name": "Political communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_communication?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 9246, "name": "Social Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13873, "name": "Twitter", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Twitter?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 24176, "name": "Brazilian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brazilian_Politics?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 38334, "name": "Political Mobilization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Mobilization?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 44789, "name": "Media and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Politics?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 53034, "name": "Cultural hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 70659, "name": "Contentious Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contentious_Politics?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 929021, "name": "Online Social Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Online_Social_Movements?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1033812, "name": "Social Media and Political Activism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media_and_Political_Activism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1901957, "name": "Black Lives Matter", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Lives_Matter?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 34970812, "title": "QUEERING THE REFORM/REVOLUTION DYAD: A SPATIOTEMPORAL DIALECTIC", "created_at": "2017-10-26T19:14:07.238-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34970812/QUEERING_THE_REFORM_REVOLUTION_DYAD_A_SPATIOTEMPORAL_DIALECTIC?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_34970812", "summary": "All ages deal with the debate between reform and revolution in the contexts of their distinctive challenges, problems, and prospects. While reflecting on today's socio-political realities in the U.S., this paper identifies a theoretical stagnancy in academia that deters any radical praxis for revolution. Addressing some key theoretical stances within the reform/revolution dyad, the paper argues that any criticism of \" revolution in a linear future \" is no easy approval for \" reform in a static present \" either. Also, replacing the \" apocalyptic future \" with the \" here and now \" of the progressive present is perhaps inadequate without critically reflecting on the \" quality \" of the \" present \". This paper does not recommend any specific prescriptive means but outlines a speculative prospect of \" here and now \" for revolution. It critiques theoretical stances of a number of postcolonial and poststructuralist thinkers and argues that these stances eventually get appropriated within the hegemonic reform-based justice underpinning neoliberalism. It argues that using the work of Henry Lefebvre, David Harvey, and Doreen Massey, a spatiotemporal dialectic for revolution can be developed which in turn also embraces revolutionary visions of Alain Badiou. The paper explains how this dialectic reveals an inadequacy in the politics of reform and adjustment within theories of James C Scott, Michel de Certeau, Homi K Bhabha, Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze. It shows how liberal justice discourses that routinely promote reform in an attempt to misguide revolutionary potentials manage to find a comfort zone in the politics of difference. Specifically, the paper invests in the interstice between two types of theories to queer the longstanding reform-revolution dyad..", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54834066, "asset_id": 34970812, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 43570849, "first_name": "Dr. Mohammad Raihan", "last_name": "Sharif", "domain_name": "wsu", "page_name": "MohammadRaihanSharif", "display_name": "Dr. Mohammad Raihan Sharif", "profile_url": "https://wsu.academia.edu/MohammadRaihanSharif?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/43570849/95153886/84140825/s65_mohammad_raihan.sharif.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1186, "name": "Translation Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3114, "name": "Queer Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Theory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7894, "name": "Intersectionality Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 17501, "name": "Islamophobia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamophobia?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 26743, "name": "Intersectionality and Social Inequality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality_and_Social_Inequality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 34327, "name": "Intersectionality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 48174, "name": "Temporality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Temporality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 76967, "name": "Homonationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homonationalism?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 11138250, "title": "Between Relativism and Romanticism: Traditional Ecological Knowledge as Social Critique", "created_at": "2015-02-27T04:23:30.388-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11138250/Between_Relativism_and_Romanticism_Traditional_Ecological_Knowledge_as_Social_Critique?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_11138250", "summary": "\u201cTraditional ecological knowledge\u201d (TEK) is an important aspect of Canadian conservation management, but the very notion of TEK is controversial.  It can be seen as conflicting with empirically-validated conservation science; its incorporation into environmental assessment can be seen as colonialist; some argue that TEK perpetuates the myth of the ecological Indian; others argue that identifying \u201cauthenticity\u201d with \u201ctradition\u201d denies indigenous peoples access to modernity.  The philosophical issues here are myriad.  Does TEK necessarily essentialize indigenous peoples by requiring their identities to be static and rooted in the past?  Does viewing indigenous peoples as a counterpart to Western civilization paradoxically denigrate and venerate them as \u201cthe Other\u201d and assume a dichotomous framework ignorant of how they actually live?  Critics continue to analyze indigeneity in terms of purity and degradation, as if the logic of virginity was not itself an historical and contingent construction of colonialism.\r\n\tI argue that this fashionable skepticism is as mistaken as the \u201cmyths\u201d it seeks to desecrate.  Debate rages as to how TEK should or should not be critiqued, but how TEK might critique mainstream Canadian culture is conveniently neglected.  Indigenous perspectives are thus in a bind:  scholars criticize them or defend them from criticism, and yet neutralize their ability to criticize the status quo.  The uncritical result is tacitly affirmative \u201chybridity,\u201d social acquiescence to modernity as a fait accompli.  Skeptics thus presuppose that there can be no norms to which cultures are beholden, meanwhile contradicting their own relativism when interpreting tradition through the lens of Enlightenment progressivism.\r\n\tBy contrast, a model for understanding how appropriating indigenous knowledge can be appropriate is needed.  Though it is usually summarily dismissed, I suggest the radical environmental philosophy known as \u201cprimitivism\u201d to this end:  the use of contemporary, historic and pre-historic hunting-gathering as grounds for criticism of contemporary Canadian life.  The paradoxes of TEK are manufactured by the agrarian logics which primitivism calls into question.  Understanding TEK as social critique may illumine not only the failings of so-called civilization, but also many of the struggles faced by aboriginals in Canada.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

The theoretical anchors of this course seek to foreground the culturally-hybridised phenomena of intra- and inter-continental exchange through transnational fiction and the diasporic novel; more often than not, the authors of such novels are based in Europe or America but use Indian locales, myths, historical and fictive narratives and socio-cultural motifs-- even someone born and raised abroad, like Sir Vidiadhar S. Naipaul-- for their fiction. The diasporic Indian(/-origin) novelists represent an important, even crucial facet of the Afro-Asian cultural response to the normative and prescriptive presumptions of colonialism; even without using the important and useful postcolonial analytical categories, one finds a keen non-monocultural, nuanced-hybrid rootedness in the novels and novelists of the Indian Diaspora, which does represent an attempt to explore the Indian societal prisms as alternative sites of multicultural coexistence, intercultural subjectivity and a renewed, if flawed, civility. In this course, we will look at the relevant exchanges and encounters between the 'global' and the 'local' and 'modernity' and 'tradition' in the selected texts; in the process, key concepts of literary theory and the Euro-American and Indian novel will be discussed and debated, locating the course within the domain of comparative literary theory. \r\nhttp://www.fu-berlin.de/vv/de/lv/149057?query=Chakrabarti&id=149057&locale=de&sm=119983", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35282307, "asset_id": 8966767, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4052456, "first_name": "Gautam", "last_name": "Chakrabarti", "domain_name": "euv-frankfurt-o", "page_name": "GautamChakrabarti", "display_name": "Gautam Chakrabarti", "profile_url": "https://euv-frankfurt-o.academia.edu/GautamChakrabarti?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4052456/1549646/1880218/s65_gautam.chakrabarti.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 136, "name": "Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2587, "name": "The Novel", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Novel?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4195, "name": "Cultural Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 8356, "name": "Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13144, "name": "Indian Diaspora (Migration and Ethnicity)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Diaspora_Migration_and_Ethnicity_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13353, "name": "Indian English Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_English_Literature?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13995, "name": "Postcolonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 14889, "name": "History Of Cultural Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_Of_Cultural_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 15863, "name": "Postcolonial Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Literature?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 23087, "name": "Salman Rushdie", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Salman_Rushdie?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 23342, "name": "Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 25486, "name": "Postcolonial theory (Cultural Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_theory_Cultural_Theory_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 31221, "name": "InterCultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/InterCultural_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 36172, "name": "Amitav Ghosh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amitav_Ghosh?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 41435, "name": "Indian Writing in English", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Writing_in_English?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 53076, "name": "Diaspora, Indian Writing in English, Post colonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Indian_Writing_in_English_Post_colonial_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 70068, "name": "Indian Writing in English, Diasporic Cultural Fiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Writing_in_English_Diasporic_Cultural_Fiction?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 100573, "name": "Third Space and Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Third_Space_and_Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 106306, "name": "Interculturality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interculturality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 148686, "name": "INDIAN DIASPORIC LITERATURE", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/INDIAN_DIASPORIC_LITERATURE?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 162873, "name": "Anita Desai", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anita_Desai?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 167746, "name": "Cultural and Social Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_and_Social_Anthropology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 223407, "name": "V.s.

My paper through a study of the novels and short stories of Rohinton Mistry depicts how a revered minority from the British colonial times not only fell to the politics of post-Independence India but also a great rift occurred in their own philosophy of life and thinking. Mistry, belonging to the \"New Diaspora\", has an ambivalent take on migration. My paper acutely travels through the liminality of the hybrid existence of the Parsis. It reflects the Parsi acculturation in the Indian Society and away, which could never do away with their alienation. This resulted in their yearning for a permanence in their roots.

Whatever we create arises from the collision of our creative, aesthetic impulses and our epistomological standpoints. Homi Bhabha's\nnotion of the third space of enunciation, which results from the coming together of two different cultural traditions, has particular relevance in this context. As Ikas and Wagner (2009, 2) note, the negotiation of two cultures leads to a displacement of the old and the emergence of a new, hybrid identity.\nThis theoretical concept was transposed into the creative arena to inform the understanding of the outcomes resulting from writing an issues-based young adult novel. The project\u2019s aim was to create a fiction that re-storied meta-narratives around the relationship of those in Western, consumeristic culture to the earth. An ecocritical\nepistemological perspective thus fed in to the creative writing journey. The risk I faced as a white female located in an affluent, Western culture was that any emergent narrative would simply re-frame known meta-narratives around the dominant social paradigm, as defined by Koger and Winter (2010); a paradigm which sees the earth as a dead resource to be utilised. However, the process was guided by a\nnarrative therapy methodology, which offers a specific structure not only for breaking apart the known through the post-structuralist process of deconstruction, but for then identifying alternative stories and finding among these the threads of new, previously unknown (or at least unrecognised) stories that can emerge.\nThe writer\u2019s discovery was that this methodology also provided a meeting ground where principles and issues could join with aesthetics in a constant process of negotiation. This process veered from conflictual to complementary at different times.\nThe writer\u2019s practice likewise veered from analytical to instinctual, from being guided by theory to being guided by the creative impulse. Allowing this merging of the known with the unknown resulted in an emergent narrative that achieved some of the project\u2019s aims in unexpected, unlooked-for ways. Not only did the writer discover a\nhybrid practice where principles and storytelling could merge, but the resulting story brought forth tropes, characters and ideas that offered new choices for eco-critical storytelling. This presentation therefore investigates which key aspects of the writer's practice led to the creation of a third space from which an eco-critical narrative which\nchallenges and moves forward from the dominant social paradigm.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34586512, "asset_id": 8146408, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13951721, "first_name": "Rachel", "last_name": "Le Rossignol", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RachelLeRossignol", "display_name": "Rachel Le Rossignol", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RachelLeRossignol?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13951721/8845939/9875241/s65_rachel.le_rossignol.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1, "name": "Creative Writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creative_Writing?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 58052447, "title": "Ibridazione e mediazione culturale nel carteggio di Ulisse Aldrovandi", "created_at": "2021-10-15T02:22:37.077-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/58052447/Ibridazione_e_mediazione_culturale_nel_carteggio_di_Ulisse_Aldrovandi?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_58052447", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 72649867, "asset_id": 58052447, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 44850553, "first_name": "Noemi", "last_name": "Di Tommaso", "domain_name": "unibo", "page_name": "NoemiDiTommaso", "display_name": "Noemi Di Tommaso", "profile_url": "https://unibo.academia.edu/NoemiDiTommaso?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/44850553/11912046/54707982/s65_noemi.di_tommaso.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26327, "name": "Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medicine?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 320242, "name": "Ulisse Aldrovandi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ulisse_Aldrovandi?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 676900, "name": "Girolamo Mercuriale", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Girolamo_Mercuriale?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 56912886, "title": "Identity as a Construct: Reading Blackness in Eugene O'Neill's The Emperor Jones", "created_at": "2021-10-10T04:34:44.849-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/56912886/Identity_as_a_Construct_Reading_Blackness_in_Eugene_ONeills_The_Emperor_Jones?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_56912886", "summary": "This paper aims to explore how racialized identities are typified as a modernist construct in Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s The Emperor Jones (1920). To this end, the notion of whiteness is identified as a mediated construct and contextualized in the proliferation of American minstrel shows. This popular entertainment projected to white audiences the racial means of differentiation from black caricatures and clich\u00e9s at the time of segregation. The echoes of minstrel shows and modernists\u2019 instrumentalization of 1920s primitivism serve to initially address the characterization of blackness in Brutus Jones\u2019 identity. Assessed through this in-between construction of symbolic borderlands in which the protagonist is both colonizer and colonized, his blackness becomes a metaphorical mask of otherness while his whiteness shapes the colonial performance of material whiteness. Although he envisions the white ideal in his systematic practices in the Caribbean island, his fragmented identity and his hybridity subject him to a primeval racialized past, to primitivism and atavism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 72065928, "asset_id": 56912886, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 72921148, "first_name": "Mar\u00eda Isabel", "last_name": "Romero-P\u00e9rez", "domain_name": "granada", "page_name": "Mar\u00edaIsabelRomeroP\u00e9rez", "display_name": "Mar\u00eda Isabel Romero-P\u00e9rez", "profile_url": "https://granada.academia.edu/Mar%C3%ADaIsabelRomeroP%C3%A9rez?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/72921148/20715978/20288625/s65_mar_a_isabel.romero_p_rez.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10, "name": "American Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Literature?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 22948, "name": "Late 19th/Early 20th Century American Theatre & Drama", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Late_19th_Early_20th_Century_American_Theatre_and_Drama?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 31641, "name": "American Theatre of the 20th Century", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Theatre_of_the_20th_Century?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 46961, "name": "Eugene O'Neill", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eugene_ONeill?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 56163, "name": "Otherness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Otherness?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 44412115, "title": "Der Mensch als Datenstrom? - Zum Verh\u00e4ltnis von Hybridit\u00e4t und Subjekt im bzw. durch den Cyberspace", "created_at": "2020-11-01T05:05:11.188-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44412115/Der_Mensch_als_Datenstrom_Zum_Verh%C3%A4ltnis_von_Hybridit%C3%A4t_und_Subjekt_im_bzw_durch_den_Cyberspace?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_44412115", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64823538, "asset_id": 44412115, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 22830372, "first_name": "Rossano", "last_name": "Della Ripa", "domain_name": "th-nuernberg", "page_name": "RossanoDellaRipa", "display_name": "Rossano Della Ripa", "profile_url": "https://th-nuernberg.academia.edu/RossanoDellaRipa?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/22830372/48986097/37013996/s65_rossano.della_ripa.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53631, "name": "Sociology of Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Cyberspace?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 431218, "name": "Subjektivierung", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subjektivierung?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 687005, "name": "Akteur-Netzwerk-Theorie", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Akteur-Netzwerk-Theorie?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3615221, "name": "Praxissoziologie", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Praxissoziologie?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 37867345, "title": "Egyptianizing Practices and Cultural Hybridity in the Southern Levant During the Late Bronze Age", "created_at": "2018-11-28T03:05:31.884-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37867345/Egyptianizing_Practices_and_Cultural_Hybridity_in_the_Southern_Levant_During_the_Late_Bronze_Age?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_37867345", "summary": "\nThis article explores how material culture is used to shape, mediate and transform social relations within contact zones. The aim is to highlight cultural hybridity, namely the material expression of new social practices within a colonial third space. It focuses on the Gaza region of the southern Levant during the later 2nd millennium BCE, a cosmopolitan period, illustrated by large-scale movement of goods, raw materials, and exotic luxuries over vast distances around the East Mediterranean resulting in cultural connectivity.

The topics explored here are Japanese Buddhism and the issue of human rights, Shint\u014d\u2019s self-representation as a \u2018religion of the forest,\u2019 and K\u014dfuku no Kagaku\u2019s adoption of Theosophical themes.

While in this case the catalyst in the process is provided by an external source, the recent reshaping of Shint\u014d as a \u2018religion of the forest\u2019 may be characterized as a glocalization leaning to \u2018native\u2019 sources, in which the \u2018native\u2019 religious tradition is subject to a creative reading following the worldwide growing awareness of ecology. Here a tendency to emphasize the superiority of the \u2018native\u2019 culture may also be noticed.

Between the time of the Louisiana Purchase (1803) and the annexation of Westernmost part of West Florida by the United States (1810), the laws and norms of the Territory criss-crossed in various ways those of Spain and the United States. Indeed, the territory was, in turn, French, British, and Spanish before being annexed, in part, by the Americans. For the period under study here, and decades before, its settlers were largely Anglophone, while its laws were a variant of the Spanish colonial ius commune. West Florida had an especially close relationship with the area that would become the new American Territory of Orleans (1805), especially the city of New Orleans. Carved out of the vast Louisiana Territory purchased from France, the Territory of Orleans had its own complex history. Its population was still largely Francophone. In its first decade, its laws were already a gumbo of continental and Anglo-American ingredients.

The rear window opens, and the unmistakable moustached profile of Hercule Poirot appears! \r\n\r\nThis paper investigates the representation of Agatha Christie\u2019s character in the series, and in particular how Poirot functions as a transnational character. Does the anime succeed in transferring Poirot to a different context? What are the ways in which the character of Poirot is made accessible to a young female Japanese audience? Is he made Japanese or is the anime \u2018westernised\u2019? In order to answer these questions, the paper analyses the series in the context of the \u201cshojo\u201d genre, and examines its representation of Poirot with references to the long lasting British ITV Series 'Agatha Christie\u2019s Poirot'.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 11597488, "asset_id": 1485931, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1365094, "first_name": "Serena", "last_name": "Formica", "domain_name": "derby", "page_name": "SerenaFormica", "display_name": "Serena Formica", "profile_url": "https://derby.academia.edu/SerenaFormica?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1365094/498244/2407154/s65_serena.formica.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3191, "name": "Japanese Anime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_Anime?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65833, "name": "Agatha Christie", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agatha_Christie?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 439412, "name": "Poirot", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poirot?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44923828, "title": "NOMADIC IMAGES.

In his Halotti Pompa / Splendours of Death (2004, 2006) we can find several poems bearing the stigmas of the legend of Ahasver, the wandering Jew. This analysis maps the transtextual and intratextual relations of these poems by using the theory of transtextuality of G\u00e9rard Genette. Two poems from the first book of the collection (Nagyheti Szekvenci\u00e1k / Sequences of Holy Week) which are also part of the four Aeternitas poems (which can be considered as a minor cycle) and the poem J\u00e9zus Ahasv\u00e9rus / Jesus Ahasver from the third book (Haszid Szekvenci\u00e1k / Hasidic Sequences) utilize the legendary motif in a quite different way. By discovering the relations with pretexts of these poems, as well as the contextual or intratextual relations, we can clearly see these differences. The couple of Aeternitas poems which contain the incorporated legendary narrative and its particular source \u2013 the narratives about resurrected Jesus from the Gospels of John and Luke \u2013are in fact rewriting their primal pretext: the baroque poem collection Tintinnabulum Tripudantium. On the other hand, J\u00e9zus Ahasv\u00e9rus /Jesus Ahasver in Hasidic Sequences is one of the messianic figures, who repetitively returns to our world.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49881355, "asset_id": 29435264, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 53072779, "first_name": "Sz\u00e1z", "last_name": "P\u00e1l", "domain_name": "comeniusuniversity", "page_name": "Sz\u00e1zP\u00e1l", "display_name": "Sz\u00e1z P\u00e1l", "profile_url": "https://comeniusuniversity.academia.edu/Sz%C3%A1zP%C3%A1l?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/53072779/14392861/15309923/s65_sz_z.p_l.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8536, "name": "Hybridization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridization?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10232, "name": "Intertextuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intertextuality?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10713, "name": "Christology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10947, "name": "Jewish - Christian Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jewish_-_Christian_Relations?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 27014, "name": "Jewish Messianism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jewish_Messianism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 58833, "name": "Motifs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Motifs?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 73221, "name": "Transtextuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transtextuality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 694323, "name": "Modern and Contemporary Hungarian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_and_Contemporary_Hungarian_Literature?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2555984, "name": "Borb\u00e9ly Szil\u00e1rd", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borb%C3%A9ly_Szil%C3%A1rd?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 22687081, "title": "Tartessos", "created_at": "2016-03-02T05:17:08.810-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/22687081/Tartessos?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_22687081", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50886764, "asset_id": 22687081, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2318738, "first_name": "Norman", "last_name": "Lindner", "domain_name": "uni-jena", "page_name": "TierraRitmicaRoja", "display_name": "Norman  Lindner", "profile_url": "https://uni-jena.academia.edu/TierraRitmicaRoja?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2318738/733568/910735/s65_tierra.ritmica_roja.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 322097, "name": "Phoenician trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phoenician_trade?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 15135409, "title": "Water from a Hybrid Polynesian Context", "created_at": "2015-08-24T00:35:42.817-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15135409/Water_from_a_Hybrid_Polynesian_Context?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_15135409", "summary": "The centrality of water in terms of it being essential to life, significant in geomorphology and deserving of management as a resource is widely acknowledged.

The second features numerous\r\npopular music fusions of the marimba repertoire with genres including rock, salsa, reggaet\u00f3n, and more, with broad appeal to audiences throughout the country and beyond. The new popularity of the marimba clearly marks a moment of arrival for Ecuador\u2019s black community, one coinciding with and contributing to its increased visibility on the national political stage.

This article demonstrates that the \u201cthird space\u201d, while opening the avenues for pluralities and negotiations, unsettles and problematizes the issues of identity, belonging, and home in Jean Rhys&#39; Wide Sargasso Sea. Discussions on why Antoinette\u2019s position as a Creole in Jamaica problematizes her status and identity, and what barriers negate herself and her sense of belonging are central to this research. I further investigate the roles of Western hegemonic presence in Antoinette\u2019s subjectivity, and her sense of liberation and autonomy. Antoinette\u2019s position in a liminal space not only jeopardizes her identity, her longing for home and belonging, but also creates a hybrid identity that emerges in a moment of historical transformation in Jamaican history.

To avoid an all inclusive definition of collage, certain boundaries must be defined. The hybrid must\nbe considered collage conceptually, as it reveals its sources within its even composition. On the other hand an integrated object reveals no trace of its disparate origins. Although collage\u2019s roots lie in the vernacular, the history of fine art collage begins the early twentieth century. It was originally used as a formal device, but it quickly became an important conceptual tool for artists, particularly the Dadaists. The bases for this new medium certainly lay beyond the art sphere. Collage entered the artists\u2019 vocabulary at the time of the First World War and its influence has spread since. The availability of materials\nand techniques had developed over the previous century and a half, but the suddenness of its spread and development detonated at a particular juncture of politics and economy. Leon Trotsky\u2019s Law of Uneven Development helps explain the pitched struggle of advancing capitalist competition that created the conditions for the First World War. It can also explain the advent of self- contradictory modes of visual communication. The key to collage is this contradiction. Through the combination of two or more disparate real-world objects it creates new meaning. This is the Hegelian dialectic made visible. The totality of the objects contains a new meaning comprised of the existence of the two or more disparate objects. The possible meaning depends on the signs that comprise the dialectic of collage. A sign contains a real and implied history and a contemporary construction of meaning which, in combination with additional signs, imbues collage with layers of meaning. This totality\nof meaning also fundamentally undermines narrative structures. Meaning is conveyed almost instantly with collage, thus arming it with the radical power of the subversion of traditional linear thought and narrative. The political potential of collage also depends on its use of real-world objects as signs. Not only has the presence of found-objects in the art world led to an important rethinking of the role of the artist and challenged the very definition of art, the found-object must be understood as signifier and signified. Today the political significance\nof collage has been greatly eroded as it is more frequently viewed in television and marketing than in the art sphere. Yet, significant innovations in the medium continue to manifest. Artists like Laila Curtis, Mike Nelson, Thomas Hirschhorn, etc. continue to advance collage. The material conditions that gave way to collage still exist. In fact, its political and economic grounds are in a more pronounced state of contradiction and crisis. If the origins of collage were first seen in vernacular combinations and collections, perhaps the future of collage can be seen in today\u2019s colloquial object and image making.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63442262, "asset_id": 43178200, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 99524917, "first_name": "Jim", "last_name": "Ricks", "domain_name": "dahphd", "page_name": "JimRicks", "display_name": "Jim Ricks", "profile_url": "https://dahphd.academia.edu/JimRicks?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/99524917/21696693/21019332/s65_jim.ricks.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22154, "name": "Collage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Collage?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53285, "name": "Dadaism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dadaism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 112191, "name": "Dadaism & Surrealism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dadaism_and_Surrealism?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 39934853, "title": "CFP: Octavia Butler\u2019s Afrofuturistic Visions", "created_at": "2019-07-26T04:32:36.124-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39934853/CFP_Octavia_Butler_s_Afrofuturistic_Visions?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_39934853", "summary": "Seeking final submissions for Octavia Butler\u2019s Afrofuturistic Visions: Reframing Identity, \nCulture, and History. This edited collection is under contract with Lexington Books and \nslated for publication in 2020.\n\nA founding voice of Afrofuturism, Octavia E. Butler challenged and reframed the hegemonic understandings of identity, history, and even territory in her fiction, employing a literary arsenal of aliens, mutants, vampires, time travelers, and new religions. This collection brings together essays specifically exploring Afrofuturist themes in Butler\u2019s oeuvre, such as her unique approach to transculturation and her use of the generic conventions of science fiction \nto subvert Western humanist ways of considering and understanding the world.\n\nThe collection is organized in three sections: Biopolitics and Hybridity, Genetic Imperatives, and Apocalypticism and Futurity. We seek essays that will incorporate central themes from current Afrofuturist and Butler scholarship, including: biopolitics, defining the human, trauma studies, disability studies, ecocriticism, knowledge creation, power structures, distinguishing nature and culture, postcoloniality, the apocalypse in literature, as well as race and social critique in literature. We already have a number of essays on Lilith\u2019s Brood (the Xenogenesis trilogy), the Parable books, and Fledgling, so we especially welcome essays on Seed to Harvest (the Patternmaster books) as well as Butler\u2019s short fiction and unpublished work. We are \nmost interested in work that will point to new directions and agendas in Butler studies, including her lasting legacy on the continually evolving directions of Afrofuturism. \n\nAbstracts of no more than 500 words and a brief CV should be e-mailed to the editors, \nLilith Acadia (Trinity College Dublin) and Ji Hyun Lee (Cornell University) at oebutlerbook@gmail.com as Microsoft Word documents no later than August 15, 2019. \nThe press strongly prefers that contributors have PhDs in hand by the time we go to press. Invitations for full papers will be sent by August 31, 2019; \nInitial drafts (5,000 to 8,000 words) are expected by October 15, 2019; and\nFinal drafts will be needed by December 1, 2019. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60122083, "asset_id": 39934853, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 200519, "first_name": "L.", "last_name": "Acadia", "domain_name": "taiwan", "page_name": "LAcadia", "display_name": "L.

Species of Platanus have long been known to hybridize, and the London plane, Platanus x hispanica, is a well-known example of a hybrid species that formed in historical times. In addition, morphological studies have suggested past interspecific or interlineage hybridization and reticulation as possibly important factors in the evolution of the genus. This study aims at unravelling the complex evolutionary information contained in internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. \nMethods \u2014 The ITS of the 35S nuclear ribosomal DNA are biparentally inherited, multi-copy markers with a high potential for resolving intrageneric relationships especially when ancient hybridization (reticulation) is involved. Phylogenetic trees, splits graphs and motif analysis are used to extract phylogenetic information from 223 cloned ITS sequences, representing ten species and varieties of Platanus. Non-pseudogenous and pseudogenous sequence motives are assessed to explain how different evolutionary modes contribute to possibly conflicting character state patterns in the ITS. \nKey Results \u2014 It was found that putative non-functional ITS copies (\u2018pseudogenes\u2019) form distinct groups in phylograms and splits graphs, and that pseudogenous lineages reflect ancient hybridization events conserved in the ITS.

Under Latin rule, Orthodox Romanians lived together with Catholic Hungarians, Szeklers, and Saxons, their long-lasting conviventia generating frequent encounters with the culture of the Other, which left deep traces in the religious art of both confessional groups. Having been fully connected to the main cultural trends of Latin Europe, the dominant Catholics commissioned and produced throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth century religious art that was deeply rooted in the spirituality of the Catholic West. This essay deals with the question of medieval painters trained in Byzantium, who decorated murals in Latin-rite churches and who received commissions from Catholic patrons. It focuses on two case studies \u2013 the mural decoration of the nave of the Calvinist (former Catholic) church in S\u00e2nt\u0103m\u0103ria-Orlea (1311) and the paintings of the sanctuary of the Lutheran (former Catholic) church in D\u00e2rlos (late-fourteenth \u2013 early-fifteenth century). Both churches were located in the Voivodate of Transylvania, a region where Orthodox Romanians lived alongside Catholics but under the Latin rule of the latter. This context contributed to the emergence of frequent phenomena of eclecticism in the sphere of religious art, which escape the usual categories of medieval art and which challenge traditional art-historical classifications.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 75199386, "asset_id": 62169456, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 725693, "first_name": "Dragos Gh.", "last_name": "Nastasoiu", "domain_name": "nec-ro", "page_name": "DragosGhNastasoiu", "display_name": "Dragos Gh.

It also examines such issues as cultural change and identity politics, tourism and modernity, ethnic relations and representations, Tibetan politics, memory and history, civil associations, collective resistance, center-periphery dynamics, gender symbolism and colonialism, Chinese nationalism and \u201cmale anxiety,\u201d and so on. \n\n\u2028This book distinguishes itself in multiple ways (not necessarily out of intentional design though): \n1)\tAs indicated by some reviewers and readers, it is one of the first book-length works that has endeavored to theorize the Sino-Tibetan borderlands (and simultaneously problematize the idea about frontiers/margins at large). In so doing, I coin the ideas of convergence zone and voluntary/strategic marginality to demonstrate how \u201cborderlandness\u201d or marginality could become an opportunity for locals to act as agents.\n2)\tIt poses a serious challenge to oftentimes taken-for-granted narratives about one Tibet (and one China) by advancing the idea of many Tibets (and many Chinas) through a careful analysis of internal heterogeneity between/among various Tibetan societies.  \n3)\tIn developing a dialogue with political science, sociology and other disciplines, this work showcases an effort to integrate bottom-up and top-down, and micro-and-macro approaches to analyzing local politics by showing how collective resistance in a remote Tibetan village is local and global at the same time \u2013 \u201cglobal\u201d in the sense of this study\u2019s broad implication for state-society relations in an authoritarian regime and the political prospect of grassroots associations of various kinds. \n4)\tThis is probably the first and so far the only formally published book-length ethnography in English (with a Western academic press) by a Tibetan from China. What is this supposed to mean? It means little or much, depending on the context. In either case, my positioning in the book is likely to be challenged in one way or another (as has been happening). Thus, in my ongoing new book project, I discuss the pitfalls and promises of such a positioning, especially that regarding my status as a \u201cnative anthropologist\u201d (China/Tibet) based however in an overseas institution with strong \u201cpostcolonial colors.\u201d\n\n\n\u2028\u2028\u2028\u201cA rollicking romp through the complexities of local identity.

Blumenbergs alternativer Vorschlag l\u00e4uft auf eine Analyse der Wechselbeziehung zwischen Metapher und Begriff hinaus \u2013 eine Analyse, deren Fokus darauf liegt, \"die logische 'Verlegenheit' zu ermitteln, f\u00fcr die die Metapher einspringt\".  Dergestalt nimmt die Metaphorologie eben jene epistemischen Zonen in den Blick, in denen die eingesetzten Metaphern theoretisch eigentlich \"gar nicht 'zugelassen'\" sind, aber gleichwohl eine Vermittlungsfunktion \u00fcbernehmen.\nEben diese merkw\u00fcrdige metaphorologische Interferenz macht sich pr\u00e4gnant am Terminus 'Hybridit\u00e4t' bemerkbar, dessen Verwendungsweise in kultur- und medienwissenschaftlichen Diskussionszusammenh\u00e4ngen bis heute zwischen begrifflichen und metaphorischen Implikationen changiert. Der mittlerweile ubiquit\u00e4r einsetzbare Ausdruck f\u00fcr alle m\u00f6glichen Formen der Vermischung und Vermengung  ist fragw\u00fcrdig geworden \u2013 nicht zuletzt deswegen, weil seine Verwendungsweise in kultur- und medienwissenschaftlichen Kontexten immer noch \u2013 und immer wieder \u2013 von seinen biologischen Konnotationsh\u00f6fen \u00fcberblendet wird.\nIn diesem Beitrag m\u00f6chte ich der Frage nachgehen: Was kommt danach?

Welche alternativen kulturwissenschaftlichen Konzepte k\u00f6nnen in Dienst genommen werden, um die komplexen Konfigurationen des Vermischens und Verbindens von Medien und Kulturen, von Denkformen und Lebensformen, zu beschreiben?\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61896831, "asset_id": 41740525, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 557720, "first_name": "Uwe", "last_name": "Wirth", "domain_name": "uni-giessen", "page_name": "UweWirth", "display_name": "Uwe Wirth", "profile_url": "https://uni-giessen.academia.edu/UweWirth?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/557720/9047439/10093159/s65_uwe.wirth.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 132, "name": "History of Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3723, "name": "History of Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Science?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4195, "name": "Cultural Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Theory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5460, "name": "Conceptual Metaphor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conceptual_Metaphor?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 12040, "name": "Jacques Derrida", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jacques_Derrida?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 17378, "name": "Organ Donation and Transplantation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organ_Donation_and_Transplantation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 27261, "name": "Hans Blumenberg", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hans_Blumenberg?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 51530, "name": "Transplantation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transplantation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 53034, "name": "Cultural hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 66854, "name": "Autoimmunity (Derrida)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Autoimmunity_Derrida_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 70476, "name": "Grafting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Grafting?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 74525, "name": "Theory of Cultural Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theory_of_Cultural_Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 94490, "name": "Metaphorology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Metaphorology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 108409, "name": "Organ Transplantation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organ_Transplantation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 291521, "name": "Vegetable grafting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vegetable_grafting?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 526912, "name": "Metaphorologie", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Metaphorologie?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 592045, "name": "Hybridity and Cultural Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity_and_Cultural_Identity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1473835, "name": "Bone Grafting Materials", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bone_Grafting_Materials?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 38027210, "title": "Musical Faces of Croatian Multiculturality", "created_at": "2018-12-22T14:48:24.672-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38027210/Musical_Faces_of_Croatian_Multiculturality?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_38027210", "summary": "The article is composed as a journey through the landscape of the musics of ethnic minorities in Croatia. The peaks on this landscape are festivals, and are therefore in the focus of attention. This is followed by three stopping points: the negotiation of ownership as regards minority and majority cultural expression; the heritage production, within a multi-ethnic music tradition, proposed for an international listing of intangible cultural heritage; and the vagueness of an ethnic minority music. All three of these points serve as fragmentary backstage rehearsals for performances of multiculturality. In the conclusion the author argues that Croatia\u2019s journey is about parallel multicultural trajectories in a country on the road from its past towards new integrations, in between European multicultural nationalism and local heritage of multicultural exchange beyond compartmentalized ethnic and cultural categories.\nSa\u017eetak: \u010clanak je zami\u0161ljen kao putovanje glazbenim krajolicima nacionalnih manjina u Hrvatskoj.

The number of hafu is growing dramatically in Japan, with the latest statistics stating that one out of every 50 babies born in 2012 had one non-Japanese parent. Early childhood education represents the first formal context where children\u2019s home culture(s) and the Japanese education system connect. Early childhood centres are not only crucial sites where home and host society meet, they are places where new citizens, communities, and cultural forms emerge (Tobin, Arzubiaga, & Adair, 2013). While the faces of hafu children mark them as \u201cother\u201d in the eyes of their classmates, they are expected to assimilate into Japanese society. \nThere are few acknowledgments of diversity in the early childhood context, and despite the claim that that all are treated equally (Moorehead, 2013), many hafu children experience inconsistent treatment or exclusion. In light of Japan\u2019s aging population and dropping birth rate (Douglass & Roberts, 2003), the need for foreign labour and immigration will rise, and with it diversity. Drawing on Bhabha\u2019s (1994) notion of hybridity and giving space to the voices of parents of hafu children, this paper suggests that hafu children both embody the complexity of Japan\u2019s changing society and challenge the Japanese education system.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65014112, "asset_id": 31054927, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24796194, "first_name": "Rachael", "last_name": "Burke", "domain_name": "hiroshima-u", "page_name": "RachaelBurke", "display_name": "Rachael S Burke", "profile_url": "https://hiroshima-u.academia.edu/RachaelBurke?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24796194/9070318/10117739/s65_rachael.burke.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3753, "name": "Early Childhood Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Childhood_Education?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 16442571, "title": "Icons, Culture and Collective Identity of Postwar Hong Kong", "created_at": "2015-10-04T02:00:13.598-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/16442571/Icons_Culture_and_Collective_Identity_of_Postwar_Hong_Kong?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_16442571", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38995956, "asset_id": 16442571, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35613843, "first_name": "Catherine", "last_name": "S.

However, attempts to engage this area of studies in the case of Japanese religions have been unexpectedly few and fragmentary; the use of full-scale globalization theory remains underdeveloped. Sometimes an underlying conceptual obstacle is that the dominating perspective is reduced to the dimension of worldwide institutional expansion, which prevents a full engagement with the much more complex dynamics. In other cases, there may simply be resistance to the application of contemporary globalization theories to concrete case studies in religion. Possibly also some features peculiar to Japanese history have delayed the application of globalization perspectives to its religious worlds. Based on these premises the articles by Inoue Nobutaka, Ugo Dess\u00ec, Galen Amstutz, Victoria Rose Montrose, Girardo Rodriguez Plasencia, Regina Yoshie Matsue, and Rafael Shoji and Frank Usarski collected in this special issue address several examples and themes in this diversified, complex world as part of the ongoing work of addressing our existing gaps in awareness.",

The combination may seem far-fetched, but the result proved successful for Mitch Miller.  In the 1950s, the former Mercury A&R representative was asked to join the staff at Columbia records, which proved an advantage for the flailing revenue the record company was experiencing at the time.  From 1951 to 1955, Miller contracted the harpsichordist Stan Freeman to partake in a number of sessions where he played with the Percy Faith Orchestra (\u201cDelicado\u201d 1952), and with Rosemary Clooney.  The addition of the thin harpsichord timbre innovated the current pop sound at Columbia, and Clooney\u2019s  \u201cCome-on-a-My-House\u201d (1951) completely revolutionized her status while earning Miller a permanent home in the sphere of kitsch.  So how did a graduate of the Hartt School and former member of the Tex Beneke band find his niche as a jazz harpsichordist?  His connections to Broadway and Cy Walter certainly helped, and his place as a studio musician, comic, and radio show host gave him the credibility as a session artist and seasoned musician. \n\n",

This development has been characterized as a form of \"mass amateurisation,\" or even \"mass cultural production.\" This present state of affairs is deeply embedded in an ongoing discourse on the value of being an amateur. Both in public discourse and in scholarly debates, amateurism has been conceptually categorized as either a self-assigned role or as a label that is conferred by others. To explore the multiple meanings of amateurism, this chapter demonstrates how a media historical approach helps to better understand the full complexity of the concept. In addition, we propose that future research can benefit from the development of clear analytical approaches to identify various amateur modes of practice, while also acknowledging the ongoing hybridity of the media amateur.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 70153515, "asset_id": 53268742, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8358919, "first_name": "Tim", "last_name": "van der Heijden", "domain_name": "ou-nl", "page_name": "TimvanderHeijden", "display_name": "Tim van der Heijden", "profile_url": "https://ou-nl.academia.edu/TimvanderHeijden?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8358919/2851098/11106485/s65_tim.van_der_heijden.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2742, "name": "Typology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Typology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2972, "name": "Media History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44864, "name": "Home movies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_movies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 79532, "name": "Amateur Film", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amateur_Film?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 340099, "name": "Amateurs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amateurs?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 543992, "name": "Modes of Production", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modes_of_Production?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 565413, "name": "Amateurism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amateurism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1032853, "name": "Home Video", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Video?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 42255108, "title": "READING TIBETAN IN THE ORIGINAL CHINESE: TIBETAN SINOPHONE AUTHORS AND TRANSLATION by Duncan Poupard", "created_at": "2020-03-18T20:48:55.711-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42255108/READING_TIBETAN_IN_THE_ORIGINAL_CHINESE_TIBETAN_SINOPHONE_AUTHORS_AND_TRANSLATION_by_Duncan_Poupard?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_42255108", "summary": "Poupard, Duncan. 2019.

This has led some to question the cultural authenticity of Tibetan literature in Chinese. This article suggests that we should not confuse script and language; that stories written in Chinese can still make use of Tibetan words via certain translational strategies. A number of Sinophone Tibetan authors on the periphery effectively use Tibetan language in their writing, creating a Tibetan intellectual world by way of phonetic and semantic translation, and at the same time show how standard Chinese can be hybridized in a way that makes it possible to read the Tibetan behind the Chinese.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62407347, "asset_id": 42255108, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 15960544, "first_name": "Asian Highlands Perspectives", "last_name": "JOURNAL", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AsianHighlandsPerspectivesJOURNAL", "display_name": "Asian Highlands Perspectives JOURNAL", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AsianHighlandsPerspectivesJOURNAL?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/15960544/4326743/12990638/s65_asian_highlands_perspectives.journal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1186, "name": "Translation Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2905, "name": "Tibetan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tibetan_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4954, "name": "Translation theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_theory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7888, "name": "Literary Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 19835, "name": "Sino-Tibetan Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sino-Tibetan_Linguistics?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 20602, "name": "China studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China_studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 29966, "name": "Tibetan and Himalayan societies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tibetan_and_Himalayan_societies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 30347, "name": "Translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 31543, "name": "Theory of translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theory_of_translation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 32570, "name": "Cultural Translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Translation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 39262, "name": "Sinophone Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sinophone_Literature?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 41624, "name": "Cultural Translation Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Translation_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 50804, "name": "Literary translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_translation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 102699, "name": "Minority Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_Literature?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 136689, "name": "Tibetan Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tibetan_Language?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 364462, "name": "Tibetan Modern literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tibetan_Modern_literature?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 421071, "name": "Asian Highlands Perspectives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Highlands_Perspectives?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1534833, "name": "Modern Tibetan Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Tibetan_Literature?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 39177464, "title": "Introduction to a Postnational History of Contemporary Basque Literature (1978-2000).

It is also the first book to deploy systematically contemporary theory (poststructuralism, feminism, queer theory\u2026) to analyze Basque literature and to give a historical thesis (based on the ideas of national allegory, double consciousness, and globalization), rather than random philological data, about the way Basque literature has developed. It also contains an epilogue on recent literature (2002-2017). The introduction written specifically for the book (2004) represents the most detailed elaboration of postnationalism in Hispanic studies, which also criticizes Habermas and shows how Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s definition of minor literature is hegemonic-majoritary (Eurocentric). It also contains a critique of postcolonial theory\u2019s disregard for minority languages. The book still contains the only critical analysis of the work of Bernardo Atxaga and his calculated program (will to power) to situate himself at the center of the Basque canon. This book was the first to raise issues such as the canon, masculinity (masochism), hegemony, queerness, hybridity, desire, motherhood and female exile, historical memory, national allegory, neoliberalism, etc. The field was mainly dominated by philological and sociological analysis when this book came out and stirred much controversy.

How can a young man become a hero? These two questions find their answer in Epictetus who wonders what Hercules would have spent his days if he had not had monsters to fight. Fantastic creatures seem to be a very suitable ingredient for making heroes and this article looks at some of the battles between young people, both hunters and warriors, and monsters to bring out their convergences. \nThus we will be interested in the fight between Achilles and Penthesilea which is not a conventional fight between two human beings then in the mental fight between Oedipus and the Sphinx which reveals the differences between anthropomorphic and zoomorphic hybrids. The battles between Ulysses and Polyphemus, Heracles and the composite creatures with snake or fish tails, Perseus and Medusa, Theseus and the Minotaur will lead us to the battle between the Chimera and the assembly of Bellerophon riding Pegasus. In conclusion, this investigation will open with the reception of these subjects in Christian iconography where the theme of the fight against Evil is affirmed.\n\nLa fabrique des h\u00e9ros\nPourquoi donc, non content de s\u2019int\u00e9resser uniquement au monde qui l\u2019entoure, les artistes ? ont-ils imagin\u00e9 des cr\u00e9atures hybrides ? Comment un jeune homme peut-il acc\u00e9der au statut de h\u00e9ros ? Ces deux interrogations trouvent leur r\u00e9ponse chez Epict\u00e8te qui se demande \u00e0 quoi Hercule aurait pass\u00e9 ses journ\u00e9es s\u2019il n\u2019avait pas eu de monstres \u00e0 combattre. Les cr\u00e9atures fantastiques semblent \u00eatre un ingr\u00e9dient tr\u00e8s adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 la fabrication des h\u00e9ros et cet article se penche sur quelques-uns des combats qui opposent des jeunes gens, tant chasseurs que guerriers, aux monstres afin d\u2019en faire ressortir les convergences. \nAinsi nous nous int\u00e9resserons au combat entre Achille et Penth\u00e9sil\u00e9e qui n\u2019est pas un combat conventionnel entre deux \u00eatres humains puis au combat mental entre \u0152dipe et la Sphinge qui fait appara\u00eetre les diff\u00e9rences entre les hybrides anthropomorphiques et zoomorphiques.

Written by Abdullah al-Misri\u2014 an Arab merchant in Java\u2014, the hikayat tells the story of the colonial Dutch governor-general and his various attempts to establish modern sovereignty in Java. In the text, the governor-general is presented as a modernizer who reformed statecraft in ways that are more beneficial to the Muslim populations than that offered by local Muslim rulers. While al-Misri criticized traditional forms of sovereignty and championed the Dutch modern sovereignty, he nevertheless presented the governor-general as a character who is embedded in the medieval Islamic political philosophy. That is, rather than portraying the governor-general\u2019s reforms as Western or European, al-Misri locates him in a trajectory that connects him to the medieval sunni political thinkers ranging from al-M\u0101ward\u012b, Niz\u0101m al-Mulk and al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b.\r\n\r\nIn looking at the hikayat, this paper attempts to rethink the ways in which European norm of sovereignty was negotiated with its local context. It tries to go beyond the conventional assumption that places modernity and the shock of colonial encounter in the center of such processes. One way of reading the hikayat is by examining it as an attempt to domesticate the Dutch governor-general as a stranger king, bearing continuities with long held Islamic tradition in the region. The text also criticizes the sovereignty of the Islamic agrarian-based kingdom of Mataram. Thus, this paper examines closely the criticisms raised by al-Misri and reconstructs his vision of an ideal sovereignty while comparing it to medieval sunni political theories. \r\n\r\nAnalyzing the hikayat demonstrates the complexities involved in the translation of modern European sovereignty in a new context. It shows how European sovereignty was being imagined as Islamic and rooted in the medieval tradition. It illustrates the processes by which imported notions of sovereignty is being understood as local to the extent the governor-general animates the voice of a Muslim scholar. Hence an examination of this text opens avenues for further rumination regarding the various ambivalences that are operational in the transmission of foreign form of sovereignty in an Islamic society. In doing so, this paper rethinks the ways in which we understand evolution of sovereignty in the Islamic world.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 17546862, "asset_id": 1646091, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 19445, "first_name": "Ismail", "last_name": "Alatas", "domain_name": "nyu", "page_name": "IsmailAlatas", "display_name": "Ismail Alatas", "profile_url": "https://nyu.academia.edu/IsmailAlatas?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/19445/6543/37154135/s65_ismail.alatas.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 899, "name": "Legitimacy and Authority", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Legitimacy_and_Authority?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3661, "name": "Sovereignty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sovereignty?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 34860, "name": "Indonesian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Literature?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 102363, "name": "Malay Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 243982, "name": "Javanese studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Javanese_studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 252358, "name": "Islamic Religious Authority", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Religious_Authority?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 313099, "name": "Malay literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_literature?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 14171943, "title": "\"Snakes Without Poison?\": (Re)Negotiating Hybrid Masculinities in Thailand", "created_at": "2015-07-18T05:50:10.255-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14171943/_Snakes_Without_Poison_Re_Negotiating_Hybrid_Masculinities_in_Thailand?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_14171943", "summary": "A handful of Thai gender studies academics have noted that the field\u2019s failure to develop a satisfactory episteme of contemporary masculinities is the result of a dominant theoretical approach which has favoured cultural exceptionalism whilst eschewing the frameworks developed in Western academia. This article maintains that this approach \u2013 which I argue had been a mainstay of the Thai anthropology of the fifties and sixties and, later, during the intensive research effort of the 1990s AIDS crisis \u2013 has resulted in a currently stagnant academic construction of the Thai male as a series of crude stereotypes whose behaviour is rooted in \u2018traditional\u2019 cultural values and beliefs.\r\nDrawing on six months ethnographic fieldwork performed in the northern town of Nan during 2012, I argue that Thai gender studies must move beyond the explanatory models of \u2018traditional\u2019 Buddhist values and begin to see Thai masculinity as an intensely hybrid and internally contested discourse,  the meanings of which are constantly in flux. By analysing the discursive strategies of male members of the Nan municipal fitness centre, I note how individuals are able to reject, appropriate and (re)negotiate dominant idioms and discursive formations of masculinity in a bid to construct their own pragmatic interpretations of legitimate masculine subjectivities. In doing so, these men become implicated in a poly-vocal and power-laden discourse which constantly re-defines \u2018Thai masculinity\u2019, thereby interrupting its perceived fixity. Drawing from the works of Foucault and Bhabha, this article will introduce the term \u2018hybrid masculinities\u2019 and consider the potential benefits of its application to the established theoretical tools currently employed in the study of gender and identity in contemporary Thai culture.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38223235, "asset_id": 14171943, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33156071, "first_name": "Daniel", "last_name": "Whitehouse", "domain_name": "leeds", "page_name": "DanielWhitehouse", "display_name": "Daniel Whitehouse", "profile_url": "https://leeds.academia.edu/DanielWhitehouse?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33156071/9833411/10959010/s65_daniel.whitehouse.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3196, "name": "Heterosexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heterosexuality?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 11927, "name": "Michel Foucault", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Michel_Foucault?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13274, "name": "Masculinities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Masculinities?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 42274, "name": "Thai Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Culture?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 13894769, "title": "Upgradekultur.

representing the periphery of Europe in the context of colonial and post-colonial reflection. The analyzed examples are art works that can be treated as transcultural representations. The main concept that has been scrutinized is transculturality as proposed by Wolfgang Welsch, who criticizes the existing concepts of individual cultures, as well as the ideas of multiculturalism and interculturalism. The starting point is the belief of Nicholas Mirzoeff that all cultures are transcultures. Within the field of Visual Culture Studies, the concept of transculturality has been replaced by transculturation and transculture, which are involved in the process of constructing networked cultural identities with a hybrid structure. The notions of transculturation and transculture can also be referred to the works of Jos\u00e9 Bedia. The evolution of Mirzoeff\u2019s thinking about transculturality proceeds from the affirmation of the position of the Cuban anthropologist Alfonso Ortiz to the transformation of Welsch\u2019s concept. The photographs of Herbert Lang are juxtaposed with the concept of \"imperial transculture\", which refers to the scopic regimes of Martin Jay. These connotations also direct us toward the understanding of \"imperialism\u201d of Edward W. Said, who treats the Orient as an artificial construct. In this sense, an example of the operation of the visual regime of  colonialization can be the nkisi figures that appear in the works Fetish No . 2 (1988) by Ren\u00e9e Stout and Ta Tele (1988) by Trigo Piula, which can be interpreted in relation to Marcel Mauss\u2019s  fetishism magic and Karl Marx's commodity fetishism. Another example of the operation of the visual regime of colonialization is necropolitics during the civil war in Rwanda between the Hutu and Tutsi tribes and two more works, Scramble for Africa (2003) by Yinka Shonibare and The Chief: he who sold Africa to the colonists (1997) by Samuel Fosso. The concept of constructing an image of the Kongo peoples presented here is based on the assumption that it is the result of the operation of the discourse created by the European colonizers. This point of view can be also found in the book The Right to Look, where Mirzoeff constructs the definitions of visuality and countervisuality.\r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53295804,

Through comparison to reliefs in the Sasanian west and local artistic traditions, the stylistics and location of Rag-i Bibi are mobilized to offer a perspective that characterizes this relief as the product of Sasanian Persia and the local artistic traditions of Bactria, actively designed to appeal to a diverse audience. This perspective builds upon previous readings of Rag-i Bibi as a conventional marker of political power, arguing instead for its role as mediating between local, regional, and international audiences.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60567341, "asset_id": 40324542, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8050861, "first_name": "Evan", "last_name": "Levine", "domain_name": "brown", "page_name": "EvanLevine", "display_name": "Evan I Levine", "profile_url": "https://brown.academia.edu/EvanLevine?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8050861/2802682/17654659/s65_evan.levine.jpg"}, {"id": 1396343, "first_name": "Daniel", "last_name": "Plekhov", "domain_name": "pdx", "page_name": "DanielPlekhov", "display_name": "Daniel Plekhov", "profile_url": "https://pdx.academia.edu/DanielPlekhov?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1396343/2732605/11635339/s65_dan.plekhov.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 997, "name": "Reception Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reception_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5357, "name": "Afghanistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Afghanistan?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5583, "name": "Audience and Reception Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Audience_and_Reception_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 18209, "name": "Bactria (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bactria_Archaeology_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 19518, "name": "Sasanian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sasanian_History?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 64535, "name": "Arte Rupestre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arte_Rupestre?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 97985, "name": "Sasanian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sasanian_Archaeology?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 37263915, "title": "How to deal with Hybrids in the Anthropocene?

In order to reflect on the ethical significance of hybrids, a classification of different types of hybrids is required. Such a classification is provided by this article, based on insights from both environmental philosophy and philosophy of technology. After explaining why a new type of beings emerges in the Anthropocene, and reflecting on the one-sidedness of philosophy of technology and environmental philosophy in their focus on either technology or nature, we propose a new classification of hybrids in this article that provides a new starting point for reflections on the moral significance of hybrids in environmental philosophy and philosophy of technology.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57217554, "asset_id": 37263915, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 110734, "first_name": "Vincent", "last_name": "Blok", "domain_name": "wur", "page_name": "VincentBlok", "display_name": "Vincent  Blok", "profile_url": "https://wur.academia.edu/VincentBlok?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/110734/432961/5476864/s65_vincent.blok.jpg"}, {"id": 6433895, "first_name": "Magdalena", "last_name": "Ho\u0142y-\u0141uczaj", "domain_name": "rzeszow-pl", "page_name": "MagdalenaHo\u0142y\u0141uczaj", "display_name": "Magdalena Ho\u0142y-\u0141uczaj", "profile_url": "https://rzeszow-pl.academia.edu/MagdalenaHo%C5%82y%C5%81uczaj?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6433895/2602550/37242084/s65_magdalena.ho_y-_uczaj.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 855, "name": "Philosophy of Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_Technology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 864, "name": "Environmental Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Philosophy?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7695, "name": "Environmental Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Ethics?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8536, "name": "Hybridization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridization?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 149474, "name": "Anthropocene", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropocene?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 35758185, "title": "New Information on the Dating of the Murals of St. Nicholas Church in Ribi\u0163a: A Hypothesis", "created_at": "2018-01-25T08:28:40.776-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35758185/New_Information_on_the_Dating_of_the_Murals_of_St_Nicholas_Church_in_Ribi%C5%A3a_A_Hypothesis?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_35758185", "summary": "Bien que la restauration de l\u2019\u00e9glise de Ribi\u0163a (r\u00e9gion de Hunedoara) e\u00fbt d\u00e9marr\u00e9 aux ann\u00e9es 1994-1995 et qu\u2019elle soit encore inachev\u00e9e, les travaux de d\u00e9capage des peintures murales ont mis en lumi\u00e8re un certain nombre de nouvelles donn\u00e9es permettant \u00e0 formuler certaines hypoth\u00e8ses sur la datation des peintures murales.

Le caract\u00e8re fragmentaire de ces inscriptions et l\u2019examen critique de leur contenu ne permettent que de formuler des hypoth\u00e8ses au sujet de la datation de l\u2019ensemble des peintures murales : que ces hypoth\u00e8ses soient confirm\u00e9es ou non, nous allons le savoir lors de l\u2019ach\u00e8vement des travaux de d\u00e9capage, de nettoyage et de restauration des fresques. Le d\u00e9tail de la peinture votive avec l\u2019indication de la date chronologique lue par Silviu Dragomir comme l\u2019ann\u00e9e 6925 (=1417) ne figure pas dans la photo d\u2019avant 1930 qui accompagne son \u00e9tude. L\u2019historien roumain s\u2019est probablement bas\u00e9 sur la transcription de l\u2019inscription faite en 1869-1870 par le pr\u00eatre de Ribi\u0163a, juste un an avant la publication par \u00d6d\u00f6n Nemes des informations \u00e0 propos des fondateurs de l\u2019\u00e9glise et des inscriptions indiquant l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1404. L\u2019ann\u00e9e de l\u2019inscription fragmentaire de l\u2019autel n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 conserv\u00e9e, mais des informations qui existent encore semblent indiquer l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1393 \u00e9tant la date \u00e0 laquelle on a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 au moins la d\u00e9coration murale de l\u2019autel, sinon toute la peinture de l\u2019\u00e9glise (seule la fin de la restauration des fresques peut apporter des preuves claires et concluantes pour avancer une formule plus pr\u00e9cise au sujet des \u00e9tapes de la d\u00e9coration). L\u2019examen \u00e9pigraphique et pal\u00e9ographique des peintures et des textes de l\u2019\u00e9glise ont indiqu\u00e9 l\u2019existence d\u2019au moins deux \u00ab mains \u00bb individuelles: l\u2019inscription votive et les inscriptions avoisin\u00e9es aux images des saints rois hongrois se distinguent \u00e0 la fois entre elles et par rapport aux autres inscriptions de l\u2019\u00e9glise.

Present work is divided into three main parts following a basic strategy of interpretation: in the first part there is an attempt of building a theoretical basis for further analysis using theories of transtextuality developed by G\u00e9rard Genette, and postcolonial theory of Homi K. Bhabha (cultural ambivalence, hybridity and mimicry). Second and the longest part contains analytical studies using mentioned theoretical background for interpretations of author\u2019s three works. These chapters analyze the motif and figure of the Messiah in relation with the context of religious tradition, the mutual intertext of three works (Hungarian Jewish folksong, The Rooster is already Crowing) and the manner of adaptions, the time concepts in relation of old Hungarian literature and liturgical tradition, the using of cosmogonic motifs (creation, Golem) inherited from Hasidism and Lurianic kabbalah. Third part contains preliminary remarks for analytic chapters, as intertextual and postcolonial interpretation of the abovementioned folksong, or relations of While Child Jesus Sleeps in Our Heart with apocryphal narrative tradition about birth of Jesus Christ and Jungian and mythographic interpretation of symbols used by author. Thanks to the radical usage of texts of others and himself, the elements of Christian and Jewish tradition, Borb\u00e9ly established a unique poetic language that, on the one hand, was based on ambivalent relationship with tradition (in extent cases as provocation, blasphemy or heresy) thanks to autonomous dynamics of bricolage poetics. On the other hand, by using elements of two religious traditions (their selection, mixing and mingling as well as creating new meanings and semantic structure) this poetics can be characterized also as a transcultural process producing cases of cultural translation, ambivalent meanings, mimicry of some elements of tradition, and hybrid structure.\r\nKeywords: Hungarian contemporary poetry, transtextuality, hypertextuality, bricolage, cultural ambivalence, hybridity, mimicry\r\n\r\nAbsztrakt\r\nJelen disszert\u00e1ci\u00f3s dolgozat a kort\u00e1rs magyar l\u00edra egyik legbefoly\u00e1sosabb k\u00f6lt\u0151j\u00e9vel, a n\u00e9h\u00e1ny \u00e9ve elhunyt Borb\u00e9ly Szil\u00e1rd m\u0171veivel foglalkozik.

Desai resists the traditional linear narrative by using non-linear time and discontinuous space to defy Western Culture and its controlling structures. Using the archetype of Joseph Campbell's hero's journey, Desai also writes against the postcolonial condition by attributing a dominant position to Spanish and Indian culture. Finally, she writes in English not only to answer back to the colonial discourse but also to challenge the oppressive discourse held by men vis-\u00e1-vis women. Using both tenacious and strong male and female characters while searching for space and identity, she redefines the status of women in a male-dominated world. What Desai has in common with many of today's postcolonial authors is their focus on the linguistic hybridity of the national space, the importance of which must be recognized as an asset to postcolonial spaces rather than viewed as a means of dividing the country for the welfare of the ruling few. Drawing on Derrida's \" white mythology, \" I explore Desai's counter-hegemonic discourse as an example of counter-myth that works to reclaim a space for the subaltern voice.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46183685, "asset_id": 25817348, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2034774, "first_name": "M Kamel", "last_name": "Igoudjil", "domain_name": "american", "page_name": "MKamelIgoudjil", "display_name": "M Kamel Igoudjil", "profile_url": "https://american.academia.edu/MKamelIgoudjil?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2034774/4568306/94657050/s65_m_kamel.igoudjil.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 788, "name": "Mythology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mythology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10444, "name": "Postmodernism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postmodernism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 24879, "name": "Hegemony", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hegemony?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 30095, "name": "Cultural power and resistance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_power_and_resistance?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 73661, "name": "Transculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transculturalism?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 12616166, "title": "A Third Space of Love", "created_at": "2015-05-26T13:06:28.898-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12616166/A_Third_Space_of_Love?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_12616166", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37745304, "asset_id": 12616166, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 19977775, "first_name": "Lucia", "last_name": "Grosu-Radulescu", "domain_name": "ase", "page_name": "luciagrosuradulescu", "display_name": "Lucia Grosu-Radulescu", "profile_url": "https://ase.academia.edu/luciagrosuradulescu?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/19977775/9324288/10392320/s65_lucia.grosu-radulescu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 74062, "name": "Arundhati Roy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arundhati_Roy?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 536497, "name": "The God of Small Things", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_God_of_Small_Things?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 6496548, "title": "Sre\u010dko Kosovel and the hybridity of modernism", "created_at": "2014-03-21T07:35:30.231-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6496548/Sre%C4%8Dko_Kosovel_and_the_hybridity_of_modernism?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_6496548", "summary": "The anomalies in the distribution and reception of Sre\u010dko Kosovel\u2019s poetry texts have engendered contradictory perceptions of the poet (as a belated heir of Slovenian Impressionism, an expressionist visionary, a radical avant-garde author), and literary history had to face the problem of the periodisation of Kosovel\u2019s heterogeneous oeuvre. Kosovel\u2019s poetics (impressionist and symbolist, expressionist, proletarian, avant-garde and modernist) do reveal perceptible changes in their mode of poetic communication, in which the author aims to transcend aesthetic autonomy and open up his text to various discourses, texts, messages, themes and images of the modern world.

Un approfondissement de l\u2019anthropologie du croire, adoss\u00e9e \u00e0 une th\u00e9ologie spirituelle centr\u00e9e sur le discernement, se r\u00e9v\u00e8le particuli\u00e8rement f\u00e9cond pour penser ces enjeux. Sur le plan m\u00e9thodologique, et de mani\u00e8re transversale pour tout le travail, c\u2019est avec l\u2019aide de l\u2019\u00e9pist\u00e9mologie historique que l\u2019analyse des diff\u00e9rents concepts mobilis\u00e9s est effectu\u00e9e. Sur un plan concret, afin d\u2019illustrer ces questions, ce travail s\u2019inspire des exp\u00e9riences et d\u00e9fis du christianisme en Inde. \r\nConcr\u00e8tement donc, prenant comme point de d\u00e9part le contexte du sous-continent indien, ce travail examine l\u2019itin\u00e9raire de figures ou entreprise chr\u00e9tiennes indiennes engag\u00e9es dans diff\u00e9rents types de transferts religieux (1\u00e8re partie). T\u00e2chant ensuite (2e partie) de retracer les enjeux propres \u00e0 la missiologie depuis le Concile Vatican II jusqu\u2019\u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui en quatre lieux (dialogue interreligieux, culture, justice sociale et dialogue avec le monde s\u00e9culier), dix principes sont d\u00e9gag\u00e9s comme horizon th\u00e9ologique dans lequel s\u2019inscrivent les trois concepts th\u00e9matisant les brassages du croire. Cette recherche revient aussi sur la th\u00e9ologisation r\u00e9cente de la dimension spirituelle (3e partie) en se fondant sur l\u2019anthropologie du croire \u2013 qui s\u2019apparente fonci\u00e8rement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on entend par spirituel aujourd\u2019hui \u2013, et montre comment il se transforme et s\u2019affermit non pas contre, mais en relation avec un monde qualifi\u00e9 de \u00ab non-chr\u00e9tien \u00bb. Finalement (4e partie), ce travail examine l\u2019histoire et les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s lexicales du bricolage, du syncr\u00e9tisme, (de l\u2019hybridit\u00e9) et du m\u00e9tissage, afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer comment ils permettent, chacun \u00e0 leur mani\u00e8re, de mieux r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir certains d\u00e9veloppements (ou explorations) de la vie spirituelle chr\u00e9tienne contemporaine. \r\nLes conclusions de cette th\u00e8se soul\u00e8vent au moins trois propositions essentielles. Primo, que la notion d\u2019identit\u00e9, fondamentale quand elle se trouve interrog\u00e9e par le pluralisme religieux, peut se penser de mani\u00e8re souple, dynamique et poreuse aux influences ext\u00e9rieures. Celles-ci ont la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019enrichir plus que de menacer la vie spirituelle d\u2019un individu, contrairement \u00e0 ce que les discours conservateurs ou int\u00e9gristes laissent entendre, et d\u2019autant mieux si les concepts pour dire le brassage sont bien explicit\u00e9s. Secundo, que la mission ne peut plus se penser comme une \u00e9vang\u00e9lisation ad extra uniquement \u2013 vers le monde \u2013, mais ad intra \u00e9galement, \u00e9mul\u00e9e par la cat\u00e9ch\u00e8se ou la conversion quotidienne par exemple. Le chr\u00e9tien se trouvant en marche vers Dieu, sa propre \u00e9vang\u00e9lisation doit se poursuivre, et pourra prendre corps dans la rencontre de l\u2019autre \u2013 du non-chr\u00e9tien. Tertio, ce travail montre l\u2019importance de bien repenser la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 chr\u00e9tienne en terme dialogique plut\u00f4t que dialectique. De m\u00eame, la foi qui caract\u00e9rise la tradition chr\u00e9tienne aurait avantage \u00e0 \u00eatre th\u00e9matis\u00e9e sous l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019un croire, plus universel et commun \u00e0 toute d\u00e9marche spirituelle, afin de saisir la qu\u00eate de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 dans sa complexit\u00e9 et sa pluralit\u00e9. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79657156, "asset_id": 69639484, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 76400, "first_name": "xavier", "last_name": "GRAVEND-TIROLE", "domain_name": "independentscholar", "page_name": "xavierGRAVENDTIROLE", "display_name": "xavier GRAVEND-TIROLE", "profile_url": "https://independentscholar.academia.edu/xavierGRAVENDTIROLE?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/76400/21130/9434977/s65_xavier.gravend-tirole.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1302, "name": "Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4162, "name": "Bricolage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bricolage?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5815, "name": "Identity politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_politics?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 6280, "name": "Missiology and Mission Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Missiology_and_Mission_Theology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 14069, "name": "Religious Syncretism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Syncretism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 29547, "name": "Interreligious Dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interreligious_Dialogue?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 42108, "name": "Histoire des id\u00e9es et de la pens\u00e9e", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Histoire_des_idees_et_de_la_pensee?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 86088, "name": "Multiple Religious Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiple_Religious_Belonging?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 150705, "name": "M\u00e9tissage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/M%C3%A9tissage?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 159604, "name": "Identit\u00e9", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identit%C3%A9?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 455103, "name": "Creolisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creolisation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1116187, "name": "Spiritualit\u00e9", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spiritualite?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1198706, "name": "Epist\u00e9mologie Historique", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Epistemologie_Historique?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3140031, "name": "Th\u00e9ologie syst\u00e9matique", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Th%C3%A9ologie_syst%C3%A9matique?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3265675, "name": "Vie spirituelle", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vie_spirituelle?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3689856, "name": "Anthropologie du croire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropologie_du_croire?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 51056371, "title": "Going Beyond the Add-and-Stir Critique: Tracing the Hybrid Masculinist Legacies of the Performative State", "created_at": "2021-08-28T05:06:34.761-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/51056371/Going_Beyond_the_Add_and_Stir_Critique_Tracing_the_Hybrid_Masculinist_Legacies_of_the_Performative_State?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_51056371", "summary": "A West-centric knowledge bias has plagued International Relations (IR) for some time, prompting many non-West scholars to develop indigenous knowledge systems.

The paper contributes to the meta-discourse and theory formation by questioning the concept, term and content of \u201clinguistic hybridity\u201d. It also submits a proposal for a typology of linguistic-communicative hybridity that consists of the following prototypical main groups, each with several subtypes: (1) language-cultural, (2) semiotic, (3) medial, (4) communicative, (5) systematic, (6) paraverbal and (7) nonverbal hybridity. At last, the paper examines hybridity as an explanatory variable for language change. In conclusion, hybridity is generally a place of cultural production, with special regard to communication and language it is potentially considered as an incubator of linguistic innovation. Hybridity can be seen as the engine and as the result of language change, or language development. It represents an essential factor by which language functions and develops as a complex adaptive system. Hybridity operates as a continuous cycle. By generating innovation, it triggers language change, which in turn, leads to further and new hybridizations. The processuality of hybridity creates diversity, while at the same time it can cause the vanishing of diversity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67830412, "asset_id": 44626286, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3290213, "first_name": "Csaba", "last_name": "F\u00f6ldes", "domain_name": "uni-erfurt", "page_name": "CsabaF\u00f6ldes", "display_name": "Csaba F\u00f6ldes", "profile_url": "https://uni-erfurt.academia.edu/CsabaF%C3%B6ldes?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3290213/1124220/1409263/s65_csaba.f_ldes.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2525, "name": "Language Variation and Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Variation_and_Change?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6148, "name": "German Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_Language?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8536, "name": "Hybridization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridization?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11834, "name": "Language and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Culture?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 32622, "name": "Language Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Change?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 46948, "name": "Bilingualism and Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingualism_and_Multilingualism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 53034, "name": "Cultural hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 54008, "name": "Mehrsprachigkeit", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mehrsprachigkeit?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 58998, "name": "Transcultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transcultural_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 106306, "name": "Interculturality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interculturality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 145238, "name": "Deutsche Sprache", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deutsche_Sprache?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 164395, "name": "Transculturality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transculturality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 167659, "name": "Interkulturelle Germanistik", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interkulturelle_Germanistik?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 419863, "name": "Transkulturalit\u00e4t", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transkulturalitat?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 509939, "name": "Contact-Induced Language Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contact-Induced_Language_Change?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 539157, "name": "Interkulturalit\u00e4t", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interkulturalitat?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 716532, "name": "Sprachwandel", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sprachwandel?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 753068, "name": "Germanistische Sprachwissenschaft", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Germanistische_Sprachwissenschaft?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1002171, "name": "Culture/transculture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture_transculture_Studies?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 42287460, "title": "The Past Still Present: Gender, Racial Identity, and Double Colonialism in Doris Lessing's The Grass is Singing and Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea", "created_at": "2020-03-22T09:27:01.097-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42287460/The_Past_Still_Present_Gender_Racial_Identity_and_Double_Colonialism_in_Doris_Lessings_The_Grass_is_Singing_and_Jean_Rhys_Wide_Sargasso_Sea?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_42287460", "summary": "The themes of gender and racial identity and their treatment in Doris Lessing's The Grass is Singing and Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea fundamentally inform both novels in uneasy ways that this essay argues hold enormous contemporary importance.

These tensions are analyzed through postcolonial theories of hybridity and notions of Other to consider the impacts of these tensions and whether these still exist.

A colossal, rusted funnel-shaped structure that unapologetically cut into the cityscape, this spectacular artwork stood for half a year between 2015 and 2016 at the hectic intersection of Nathan Road and Art Square in Hong Kong\u2019s Tsim Sha Tsui District.  It invited passers-by to sing along karaoke-style to the soundtracks of seven songs performed by seven \u201cminority\u201d groups who are resident in Hong Kong. Zheng Bo\u2019s aim was to give voice to those labelled minorities by asking participants, many of whom were not minorities, to sing for and with them.\n\nThis paper examines the political efficacy of Sing for Her. Did the element of entertainment, spectacularity, and, above all, interactivity of Sing for Her successfully \u201cgive voice to\u201d the so-called minority communities?  Through Homi Bhabha\u2019s framework of the \u201cthird space of enunciation\u201d\u2014a space of discursive ambivalence that makes the emergence of agency possible, I will interrogate the identity politics of multiculturalist rhetoric in Hong Kong and consider the alternative space Zheng Bo activates. Putting the theories of Boris Groys, Grant Kester, Claire Bishop, and Jacques Ranci\u00e8re in dialogue with each other and then connecting them to Bhabha\u2019s idea of the \u201cthird space,\u201d I will argue that Sing for Her bound participants in an aesthetic tension that dialectically negotiated between reality and imagination, static representations and fluid iterations, and, ultimately,

relationship between processes of assimilation and translation: to what extent do processes of translation depend on a \u2018making similar\u2019, a \u2018resembling\u2019: an assimilation of the foreign language to one\u2019s own? To what extent can translation be described as \u2018to make similar\u2019? Is it possible that translation also entails moments of incorporation? This line of questioning extends beyond the purely linguistic problems of translation and touches on what can be called cultural translation. This concept has also been significantly shaped by Homi Bhabha, who bases his considerations on the one hand on a Concept of Hybridity, on the other hand on Walter Benjamin\u2019s essay The Task of the Translator.\nFor Bhabha, translation becomes a way of imitating an original, in which the predominance of the original dissolves through the possibility for it to be copied and transformed, thus becoming a sort of original, \"that is never finished or complete in itself.\" This implies a concept of the original that does not appear as a homogenous, static unit, but rather as something unfinished, as something still in motion. This conception of a composite, non-homogenous, and incomplete original has an effect on both our understanding of assimilation processes as well as processes of cultural translation.\nIn this article I will show why the concept of hybridity alone is not sufficient to do justice to the complexity inherent in processes of cultural translation. Indeed, my thesis is that we need a second concept as well, namely: grafting.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57272558, "asset_id": 37316051, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 557720, "first_name": "Uwe", "last_name": "Wirth", "domain_name": "uni-giessen", "page_name": "UweWirth", "display_name": "Uwe Wirth", "profile_url": "https://uni-giessen.academia.edu/UweWirth?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/557720/9047439/10093159/s65_uwe.wirth.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1186, "name": "Translation Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4954, "name": "Translation theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_theory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8330, "name": "Walter Benjamin", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Walter_Benjamin?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12040, "name": "Jacques Derrida", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jacques_Derrida?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 16201, "name": "Ecocriticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecocriticism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 24344, "name": "Translation and Interpretation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_and_Interpretation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 30045, "name": "Homi Bhabha (Cultural Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homi_Bhabha_Cultural_Theory_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 50804, "name": "Literary translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_translation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 53034, "name": "Cultural hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 62890, "name": "Hybridit\u00e9 culturelle", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridite_culturelle?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 70476, "name": "Grafting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Grafting?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 74525, "name": "Theory of Cultural Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theory_of_Cultural_Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 100573, "name": "Third Space and Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Third_Space_and_Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 282404, "name": "Postcolonial Ecocriticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Ecocriticism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 515930, "name": "Hybridity in Translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity_in_Translation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 592045, "name": "Hybridity and Cultural Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity_and_Cultural_Identity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 740895, "name": "Ecocritical Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecocritical_Theory?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 36051831, "title": "Imitationer av bysantinska mynt: Kulturm\u00f6ten i den senantika vardagen", "created_at": "2018-03-01T07:35:23.094-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36051831/Imitationer_av_bysantinska_mynt_Kulturm%C3%B6ten_i_den_senantika_vardagen?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_36051831", "summary": "Uppsala University Coin Cabinet Working Papers ;

Det av Adam beskrivna hednatemplet i (Gamla) Uppsala uppfattades l\u00e4nge som en symbol f\u00f6r motst\u00e5ndet mot \u00e4rkestiftets missionsstr\u00e4vanden, f\u00f6r vilka Sigtuna fungerade som brohuvud. Adams kr\u00f6nika har ocks\u00e5 legat till grund f\u00f6r den utbredda uppfattningen att kristendomen skulle haft det sv\u00e5rare att f\u00e5 fotf\u00e4ste i M\u00e4laromr\u00e5det \u00e4n i andra delar av Skandinavien. De hedniska motreaktioner som omn\u00e4mns i senare k\u00e4llor och som s\u00e4gs ha f\u00f6rekommit fram till omkring \u00e5r 1130 ger ocks\u00e5 en bild av ett samh\u00e4lle som under en l\u00e5ng tid befann sig i ett kristillst\u00e5nd, vacklande mellan olika former av religi\u00f6st pr\u00e4glade livstolkningar. \u00c4ven det utdragna runstensristandet har tolkats i samma riktning. \nSom kontrast till det begr\u00e4nsade och m\u00e5nga g\u00e5nger subjektiva skriftliga k\u00e4llmaterialet finns ett omfattande arkeologiskt material, framf\u00f6rallt gravar, som \u00e4r samtida med det aktuella skeendet och som kan anv\u00e4ndas f\u00f6r att ge en mer nyanserad och \u201dopartisk\u201d beskrivning av kristnandeprocessen \u00e4n vad kyrkans ovanifr\u00e5nperspektiv kan ge. Med utg\u00e5ngspunkt fr\u00e5n detta material kommer jag i den h\u00e4r artikeln att diskutera n\u00e5gra f\u00f6r skiftet avg\u00f6rande fr\u00e5gor. En s\u00e5dan \u00e4r om M\u00e4laromr\u00e5dets kristnande varit mer utdraget j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med andra regioner i Skandinavien - eller om det bara varit annorlunda? Det som framf\u00f6rallt skiljer M\u00e4laromr\u00e5det fr\u00e5n andra regioner \u00e4r de m\u00e5nga gravf\u00e4lten med tidigkristna gravar som unders\u00f6kts under senare \u00e5r och bristen p\u00e5 arkeologiska bel\u00e4gg f\u00f6r tidiga tr\u00e4kyrkor. Hur ska detta tolkas? En annan central fr\u00e5ga \u00e4r vilken betydelse Sigtuna som kunglig st\u00f6djepunkt och kristen centralort haft f\u00f6r M\u00e4laromr\u00e5dets kristnande. Slutligen diskuteras om den bild av kristnandeprocessen som det arkeologiska materialet ger kan ses som uttryck f\u00f6r ett mer eller mindre medvetet motst\u00e5nd, inte mot kristendomen som s\u00e5dan, utan mot de samh\u00e4llsf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar som f\u00f6ljde i kyrkans k\u00f6lvatten.

The Melaka Chettis are a small, dwindling community of \u2018peranakan\u2019 people.\n\nIn Malay language, the label peranakan means locally born. Peranakan people in Malaysia are the descendants of foreign traders and travellers who married local women, most notably during the time of the Melaka Malay Empire from the 1400s to 1500s.\n\nThe Melaka Chettis are one of these surviving \u2018hybrid\u2019 communities but not much focus has been given on them due to their small number, compared to the larger Chinese peranakan or Portuguese peranakan people. In this sense, this book is long overdue.\n\nBased on our extensive fieldwork in \u2018Kampung Chetti\u2019 or Chetti Village in the state of Melaka, Malaysia employing scholarly tools such as narrative inquiry, life history interviews and drawing on identity theories from the social sciences, this book is about becoming and being Melaka Chetti in modern Malaysia from the eyes of Madam Meenachi.\n\nAs one of the most senior members of the Malaysian Melaka Chetti Indian community, the many stories shared by Madam Meenachi are essentially living narratives; her stories are lived experiences and living proof of what it really means to become and to be one of the members of this small yet staunchly surviving Melaka peranakan communities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49081917, "asset_id": 28691538, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 49081931, "asset_id": 28691538, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 525189, "first_name": "Airil Haimi Mohd", "last_name": "Adnan", "domain_name": "uitm", "page_name": "AirilHaimiMohdAdnan", "display_name": "Airil Haimi Mohd Adnan", "profile_url": "https://uitm.academia.edu/AirilHaimiMohdAdnan?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/525189/185689/15336212/s65_airil_haimi_mohd.adnan.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 972, "name": "Self and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_and_Identity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2527, "name": "Heritage Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2852, "name": "Narrative", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7125, "name": "Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7666, "name": "Life history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Life_history?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 9547, "name": "Minority Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13197, "name": "Language and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Identity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 28365358, "title": "Ideologies of the Self: Constructing the Modern Ukrainian Subject in the Other\u2019s Modernity", "created_at": "2016-09-09T05:00:30.486-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28365358/Ideologies_of_the_Self_Constructing_the_Modern_Ukrainian_Subject_in_the_Other_s_Modernity?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_28365358", "summary": "Postcolonial theory has recently come under critique as an interpretative scheme applied to Eastern Europe and particularly Ukraine.

The diversity of human interaction and the hybridization processes connected therewith, on the one hand, and the fragmentary and silent character of archaeological source material on the other have been seen as insuperable obstacles to the translation of this concept into a practical method for archaeology. In my contribution, I shall attempt to overcome these barriers by breaking down a complex anthropological discourse into components that may be useful for archaeological sources. My aim is to unravel hybridization processes, which I call processes of entanglement, into distinct stages and consider the potential of each stage to be materialized in the archaeological record. I shall further attempt to distinguish between the entanglement of objects and the entanglement of social practices, because foreign, but in their materiality still unchanged, objects can be used in already entangled social practices. Subsequently, I shall examine what stage of the process of entanglement has given rise to an entangled object or social practice. Finally, the application of the concept of hybridization in recent studies on the Late Bronze Age Eastern Mediterranean will be reviewed and my own approach demonstrated on the basis of a case study.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47275233, "asset_id": 27016487, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 88199, "first_name": "Philipp Wolfgang", "last_name": "Stockhammer", "domain_name": "lmu-munich", "page_name": "PhilippWolfgangStockhammer", "display_name": "Philipp Wolfgang  Stockhammer", "profile_url": "https://lmu-munich.academia.edu/PhilippWolfgangStockhammer?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/88199/24562/21342032/s65_philipp_wolfgang.stockhammer.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 136, "name": "Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 397, "name": "Near Eastern Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Near_Eastern_Archaeology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 399, "name": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Archaeology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3016, "name": "Mediterranean prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mediterranean_prehistory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4195, "name": "Cultural Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5346, "name": "Archaeological Method & Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Method_and_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 8400, "name": "Cultural Encounters", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Encounters?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 8536, "name": "Hybridization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridization?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 18032, "name": "Aegean Prehistory (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aegean_Prehistory_Archaeology_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 18821, "name": "Archaeological Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 31221, "name": "InterCultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/InterCultural_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 34817, "name": "Prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 53034, "name": "Cultural hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 72379, "name": "Prehistoric Archeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Archeology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 74525, "name": "Theory of Cultural Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theory_of_Cultural_Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 80613, "name": "Interculturalidad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interculturalidad?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 234854, "name": "Entanglement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Entanglement?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 336263, "name": "Entangled History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Entangled_History?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 592045, "name": "Hybridity and Cultural Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity_and_Cultural_Identity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 992303, "name": "Theory of Entanglement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theory_of_Entanglement?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 19132663, "title": "DEVELOPMENT OF MANGO HYBRIDS AND DETECTION OF HYBRIDITY USING  SIMPLE SEQUENCE REPEATS (SSR) MARKERS", "created_at": "2015-11-28T04:43:04.068-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19132663/DEVELOPMENT_OF_MANGO_HYBRIDS_AND_DETECTION_OF_HYBRIDITY_USING_SIMPLE_SEQUENCE_REPEATS_SSR_MARKERS?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_19132663", "summary": "\u2018Carabao\u2019 is the only export mango variety in the Philippines.  However, its export potential is hampered by some of its inherent characteristics as thin peel making fruits susceptible to insect pests and diseases, and short shelf life.  This study was undertaken to improve \u2018Carabao\u2019 mango fruit traits and produce new hybrid cultivars/varieties through conventional breeding, and determine hybridity of the progenies using Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) markers.\nThree hundred and ninety-one cross pollinations were done by pairing/clipping method, 126 of which were reciprocal crosses. Fifteen potential fruits were produced from initial cross pollinations and hybrid seedlings with their respective parents were used in hybridity testing. From 14 SSR markers screened for polymorphism among parental lines; four markers, namely Min-160, Min-221, Min-253 and QGMi001, were selected for hybridity testing. Four progenies were found to be putative hybrids. \u2018Carabao\u2019 R1T1 x \u2018Apple\u2019 (seedling #3), \u2018Carabao\u2019 R2T1 x \u2018Apple\u2019 (seedling #1), and \u2018Carabao\u2019 R2T1 x \u2018Apple\u2019 (seedling #2) appeared to be significantly similar to both parents at the Min-221 marker, while the reciprocal cross \u2018Apple\u2019 x \u2018Carabao\u2019 R2T1 (seedling #3) appeared to show both parent\u2019s alleles at the Min-253 marker. The use of molecular markers for hybridity testing improves the efficiency in selecting new hybrids as early as seedling stage of the plant and thus, lessens the time for selection of true hybrids in the mango breeding program.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40449575, "asset_id": 19132663, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6822819,

relation to landscape, Antoine Picon argues that we are on the eve of an aesthetic re-enchantment of the world (Picon 2000). Contemporary landscape \u2013 and this is a global trait \u2013 is predominantly technological, manufactured, and hybrid. Not only its physical features but also our understanding of it has changed dramatically in the past few decades. I would like to devote my paper to developing some considerations about this anxious landscape cluttered with the rusty scraps of technological past, about the obsolete in urban landscape, or, about urban decay. \nI am especially interested in the re-enchantment of urban decay within contemporary technological landscape. It has recently been brought about by scholars, artists and others who like spending their time exploring the anxious and scrappy urban landscape. In the paper, I use their accounts and imaginary of the landscape in order to sketch out the emerging ways of aestheticisation or emotional response to such places. Since the interest as well as urban exploration movement is global, this leads me to draw some considerations about landscape as an emerging specific global experience. Landscape is not only globalised on a material level \u2013 as a locus and product of production-consumption cycles \u2013 but it is becoming so also on an experiential level.",

It first reviews the origin of SFS; then it maps SFS onto Nida's linguistic model of translation process and the Interpretive Theory of Translation; it examines in the next section, within the framework of SFS, different forms of understanding and translating hybrid and pure texts with reference to the selection of linguistic frames and more importantly the activation of scenes. The paper explains all four processes of hybridization, dehybridization, rehybridization and hybridity preservation using SFS. The study concludes that, although hybridity is a complex phenomenon, Fillmore's scenes and frames semantics can adequately explain and justify its different aspects and manifestations. Moreover, it revealed that understanding, seen in SFS model, has an element of individuality and this gives rise to a broader perspective on translation where there can potentially be as many valid translations as there are translators. This has significant implications for our conception, analysis and assessment of translation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64698089, "asset_id": 44311979, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6256794, "first_name": "Fatemeh", "last_name": "Parham", "domain_name": "allameh", "page_name": "FatemehParham", "display_name": "Fatemeh Parham", "profile_url": "https://allameh.academia.edu/FatemehParham?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6256794/48468023/48619222/s65_fatemeh.parham.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30347, "name": "Translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3786395, "name": "Scenes and Frames Semantics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Scenes_and_Frames_Semantics?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 38622145, "title": "Assimilation, Multiculturalism, Hybridity: The Dilemmas of the Ethnic Chinese in Post-Suharto Indonesia", "created_at": "2019-03-24T19:31:15.469-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38622145/Assimilation_Multiculturalism_Hybridity_The_Dilemmas_of_the_Ethnic_Chinese_in_Post_Suharto_Indonesia?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_38622145", "summary": "The dominant discourse in accommodating the ethnic Chinese in Indonesia during Suharto\u2019s regime was one of assimilation, which forcefully aimed to absorb this minority into the national body.

The May 1998 anti-Chinese riots proved the failure of the assmilationist policy. The process of democratization has given rise to a proliferation of identity politics in post-Suharto Indonesia. The policy of multiculturalism has been endorsed by Indonesia\u2019s current power holders as a preferred approach to rebuilding the nation, consistent with the national motto: \u2018Unity in Diversity\u2019.

The continuous holding of the traditional War Festival has acted for itself as an important display and field of Tsou's ethnic subjectivity and identity. Regarding cultural festival as representation of ethnic identity, there are two main discourses within the academic circle in Taiwan: the 'nostalgic' interpretation of traditional ritual, and the 'decolonization' with a strong political implication. This paper offers an alternative framework to understand the War Festival through the concept of hybridity. This article presents the ways in which the War Festival has been engulfed into the modern society, and shows how the tribal people continually de-contextualize and re-contextualizes the meanings of the War Festival. In addition, the authors argue for the critical extraction process and dynamic negotiation mechanisms should be taken as strategies for the construction of new subjectivity for the Tsou Nation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58268944, "asset_id": 38228391, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 837815, "first_name": "Ho-chia", "last_name": "Chueh", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HChueh", "display_name": "Ho-chia Chueh", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HChueh?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/837815/294517/19634358/s65_ho-chia.chueh.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36075428, "title": "Ste\u0301phanie-Aloysia Moretti, Madame culture au Montreux Jazz", "created_at": "2018-03-04T12:51:07.487-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36075428/Ste_phanie_Aloysia_Moretti_Madame_culture_au_Montreux_Jazz?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_36075428", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55963590, "asset_id": 36075428, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1573596, "first_name": "Aloysia", "last_name": "Moretti", "domain_name": "ehess", "page_name": "AloysiaMoretti", "display_name": "Aloysia Moretti", "profile_url": "https://ehess.academia.edu/AloysiaMoretti?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1573596/552495/3680423/s65_aloysia.moretti.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 35592, "name": "Jazz", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jazz?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 394053, "name": "Chimera", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chimera?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1215208, "name": "Chimaera", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chimaera?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2967731, "name": "Montreux", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Montreux?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 35467077, "title": "Beyond Hybridity to the Politics of Scale: International Intervention and \u201cLocal\u201d Politics", "created_at": "2017-12-19T04:34:56.071-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35467077/Beyond_Hybridity_to_the_Politics_of_Scale_International_Intervention_and_Local_Politics?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_35467077", "summary": "The evident failures of international peacebuilding and statebuilding interventions (PSBIs) have recently prompted a focus on the interaction between interventions and target societies and states. Especially popular has been the \u2018hybridity\u2019 approach, which understands forms of peace and governance emerging through the mixing of local and international agendas and institutions. This article argues that hybridity is a highly problematic optic. Despite contrary claims, hybridity scholarship falsely dichotomizes \u2018local\u2019 and \u2018international\u2019 ideal-typical assemblages, and incorrectly presents outcomes as stemming from conflict and accommodation between them. Scholarship in political geography and state theory provides better tools for explaining PSBIs\u2019 outcomes as reflecting socio-political contestation over power and resources. We theorize PSBIs as involving a politics of scale, where different social forces promote and resist alternative scales and modes of governance, depending on their interests and agendas. Contestation between these forces, which may be located at different scales and involved in complex, tactical, multi-scalar alliances, explains the uneven outcomes of international intervention. We demonstrate this using a case study of East Timor, focusing on decentralization and land policy.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55329301, "asset_id": 35467077, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 184, "first_name": "Lee", "last_name": "Jones", "domain_name": "qmul", "page_name": "LeeJones", "display_name": "Lee Jones", "profile_url": "https://qmul.academia.edu/LeeJones?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/184/258/35535110/s65_lee.jones.jpg"}, {"id": 450496, "first_name": "Shahar", "last_name": "Hameiri", "domain_name": "uq", "page_name": "ShaharHameiri", "display_name": "Shahar  Hameiri", "profile_url": "https://uq.academia.edu/ShaharHameiri?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/450496/146600/36551404/s65_shahar.hameiri.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14842, "name": "Timor-Leste Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Timor-Leste_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42489, "name": "East Timor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Timor?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45578, "name": "Peacebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peacebuilding?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 97792, "name": "Statebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Statebuilding?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 35189682, "title": "The Inhuman and the Automaton: Exploitation and the Exploited in the Era of Late Capitalism", "created_at": "2017-11-19T10:28:06.030-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35189682/The_Inhuman_and_the_Automaton_Exploitation_and_the_Exploited_in_the_Era_of_Late_Capitalism?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_35189682", "summary": "(This is a chapter in the Superpositions Volume co-edited by Rocco Gangle and Julius Greve published by Rowman and Littlefield International, May 2017)\n\nThe human-in-human is nonhuman or \u201cinhuman\u201d (Haraway), monstrous along with the animal, the machine and the darkness of the out-there insofar as it remains a radical hybridity or one that is philosophically unmediated.

India and Indira Ghandi\u2019s state of Emergency.\u00a0 What is significant in the literary text is Rushdie\u2019s ability to fictionalise history, fantasize his depiction of historical reality and combine history with politics through the portrayal of the individual, Saleem Sinai the narrator, in relation to the larger historical context that fashions the Indian society. Midnight\u2019s Children creates a history of India that is extremely heterogeneous and diverse, replete with stories, images and ideas- a multifarious hybrid history.\u00a0 By re-visiting the past of India, and re-writing one\u2019s own history, one which allows for the infinite variety of experiences, cultures and perspectives that make up our world, Rushdie\u2019s novel clears up a place in the historical record for th...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81017240, "asset_id": 71830540, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 207127443, "first_name": "Safia", "last_name": "Sahli", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SahliSafia", "display_name": "Safia Sahli", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SahliSafia?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/207127443/67397938/55764051/s65_safia.sahli.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23087, "name": "Salman Rushdie", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Salman_Rushdie?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 578214, "name": "Impact of Social Sciences and Humanities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Impact_of_Social_Sciences_and_Humanities?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 62445031, "title": "After Hybridity: Grafting as a Model of Cultural Translation", "created_at": "2021-11-26T02:47:45.655-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/62445031/After_Hybridity_Grafting_as_a_Model_of_Cultural_Translation?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_62445031", "summary": "In this paper, I would like to understand to what extent do translation processes presuppose a 'making similar', an imitation, an assimilation of the foreign language into one's own language?

Bhabha understands cultural translation as a process in which we can no longer assume that there is something like an original self with a static identity, and thus, translation turns into an \"activity of displacement within the linguistic sign\". \nIn my paper I am going to explore in what ways this \"displacement\" can be understood as an operation of grafting and transplantation \u2013

Will man also konzeptualisieren, was Kirchenr\u00e4ume ausmacht, laut Buchtitel deren Wandlungsf\u00e4higkeit und Wert, hat man immer auch die jeweilige kirchliche Gemeinschaft sowie deren diachrone Gewordenheit und synchrone Verfa\u00dftheit zu befragen, die solche R\u00e4ume hervorbringt und reglementiert und sich in ihnen versammelt oder sie eben aufl\u00f6st und dann anders nutzt. Dieselbe Frage ist der jeweiligen Gesellschaft zu stellen, die derartige R\u00e4ume sch\u00e4tzt oder gebraucht oder meidet. \nDer Essay bricht die gro\u00dfe Frage \u201eWie ist das Christentum im 21. Jahrhundert zu denken?\u201c auf ein vermeintliches Detail herunter: K\u00f6nnen Umwidmungen bzw. Umkodierungen von Kirchengeb\u00e4uden anders verstanden werden, wenn man diesen Proze\u00df mit dem Konzept der Hybridit\u00e4t und einem Denken der Differenz zusammenbringt? Am Paradigma der Umkodierung von Kirchengeb\u00e4uden entwickelt der Essay anhand der Theorie der Hybridit\u00e4t im Anschlu\u00df an Stuart Hall und Homi K. Bhabha ein nichtdichotomisches Denken und pl\u00e4diert f\u00fcr eine repolitisierte Theologie. Anstatt die Binarit\u00e4t von Sakralit\u00e4t und Profanit\u00e4t sowie von Innen und Au\u00dfen zu perpetuieren schl\u00e4gt er ein relationales Denken vor. Dadurch umgeht man die Falle der kulturellen Einheit ebenso wie die Falle der kulturellen Vielfalt und stellt diesen beiden Versuchungen einen Raum des Zwischen bzw. der kulturellen Differenz gegen\u00fcber. Kirchengeb\u00e4ude k\u00f6nnten so als Orte der Differenz umkodiert werden, ohne den Verweis auf ihre Geschichte zu leugnen: sie blieben der politische Ort f\u00fcr eine unbedingte Beziehung, die Innen und Au\u00dfen, Eigenes und Fremdes nicht gegeneinander ausspielt: Das Denken der Differenz suspendiert schlichtweg von diesen Dichotomien. Drei sich hieraus ergebende Lernfelder sind: Wie erkenne und relationiere ich die \u00fcblichen Dichotomien? In welcher Weise regt der Profanierungsdiskurs eine Re-Politisierung der Theologie und der Pastoral an? Was hei\u00dft das f\u00fcr die Gestaltung eines hybriden (Interaktions-)Raumes? \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66190442, "asset_id": 45685544, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

relationship between humans and non-humans through the new species appearing in the artworks of Pinar Yoldas and Gilberto Esparza, firstly by examining the term \u2018Anthropocene\u2019. \u2018Anthropocene\u2019 has not been officially approved as a geological unit, and yet it is widely studied in the fields of science, the humanities and social studies. \u2018Anthropocene\u2019 is an important concept to be used in order to find a solution for environmental pollution and global warming, but, most significantly, it rejects the dualistic reasoning of traditional humanism that exists in terms of anthropocentrism. In other words, \u2018Anthropocene\u2019 seeks to study the reciprocal relationship between humans and the world. The key notion of \u2018Anthropocene,\u2019 that both humans and non-humans exist in the world, can be interpreted by comparing the evolutionary living organisms in the artworks of Yoldas and the city parasites and plant robots in the artworks of Esparza with the technoscientific non-humans described by the Actor-Network Theory. This is a progressive way to understand a social phenomenon ecologically, and it shows the birth process of a hybrid.

He is regarded as the founder of the Mevlevi Order. On the other hand, Sufism has been officially banned in the Turkish Republic since 1925, which includes all Sufi lodges, and the Mevlev\u00ee order is no exception. Although the public visibility of Sufi practices had been illegal and Sufism had lost its legitimacy in modern Turkey, the Turkish State established and recognized commemorations in honour of Mevl\u00e2n\u00e2 approximately two decades after launching the secular reforms banning Sufism. Today these ceremonies are held annually and attended regularly by the highest state authorities. The first commemoration was held in Konya in December 1942 on the occasion of the 670th anniversary of Mevl\u00e2n\u00e2\u2019s death where Mevl\u00e2n\u00e2 was presented as \u2018the great thinker of Anatolia\u2019. This paper examines the intellectual and discursive context that helped legitimize the commemoration of a religious figure. Drawing on Michel Foucault and Edward Said\u2019s theoretical insights, it analyses the cultural-intellectual debates and framings of Mevl\u00e2n\u00e2 by the traditionalists, humanists, and nationalists, expressed in the speeches given at the first commemoration in 1942. Analysis suggests that epistemological shifts behind different conceptions of Mevl\u00e2n\u00e2 have given way to a hybrid narrative.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65669502, "asset_id": 34230040, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 789491, "first_name": "Burcu", "last_name": "Sa\u011flam Sar\u0131kaya", "domain_name": "istinye", "page_name": "BurcuSa\u011flam", "display_name": "Burcu Sa\u011flam Sar\u0131kaya", "profile_url": "https://istinye.academia.edu/BurcuSa%C4%9Flam?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/789491/268423/8007193/s65_burcu.sa_lam.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6610, "name": "Turkish Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Turkish_Nationalism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 51334, "name": "Orientalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Orientalism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 70603, "name": "Secularism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Secularism?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 34063056, "title": "'Vienen de gente de mucha discreci\u00f3n y entendimiento:' ethnic identity, ambivalence, and colonial discourses in Diego Mu\u00f1oz Camargo's Descripci\u00f3n de la ciudad y provincia de Tlaxcala", "created_at": "2017-07-28T07:35:34.948-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34063056/Vienen_de_gente_de_mucha_discreci%C3%B3n_y_entendimiento_ethnic_identity_ambivalence_and_colonial_discourses_in_Diego_Mu%C3%B1oz_Camargos_Descripci%C3%B3n_de_la_ciudad_y_provincia_de_Tlaxcala?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_34063056", "summary": "Diego Mu\u00f1oz Camargo's _Descripci\u00f3n de la ciudad y provincia de Tlaxcala_ (1585) is a well-known reference on the history of Tlaxcala that scholars have studied to better understand Tlaxcalan participation in the conquest of Tenochtitlan, its relationship with the Spanish Crown, and the author's selective approach to local history.

The study offers insights on the patterns and meanings of code-switching as used by Muslim-Arab migrants living in Italy. The fact that non-Italian codes (Arabic, French, and English) are often followed by an equivalent translation into Italian-the original language of the text-brings forward the questioning of the reason behind this particular kind of code-switching. That is, according to the text, if Italian lexical support is sufficient to describe emotions, attitudes, and behaviours, what function does code-switching play for Muslim-Arab migrants living in Italy? And is this function motivated by the dynamics of a strategic convivencia or by some hidden potencies of Othering? I argue that there exists in Divorzio all'islamica a viale Marconi a coexisting relationship between code-switching and identity, and that code switching in the novel acts as a polyphonic bridge that ingeniously connects the gap between multiple voices giving rise thereby to a hybrid zone where negotiation of meaning occurs.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53428715, "asset_id": 33371961,

"The complexity of cultural exchange witnessed in the archaeological record of ancient Cyprus and its impact on the iconographical repertoire of divine images dedicated in its sanctuaries requires a more nuanced theoretical model than those currently in use. In particular, artistic influences broadly defined as Near Eastern, Egyptian, or Greek have often been isolated as evidence of ethnic division across the religious landscape of Cyprus, even within the same sanctuary. As a result, many Cypriote sanctuaries are interpreted as host to a pantheon of foreign and local divine personalities. Such an interpretation has proven especially problematic in the case of one divine type that features a male figure clad in a lion skin, mastering a small lion and brandishing a club. Rather than privileging foreign parts over the more culturally meaningful whole, this article considers the value (and validity) of postcolonial theory as a model for examining the relationship between image and identity in Cypriote religion. While postcolonial critiques traditionally function within a modern sociopolitical context, recent scholarship has highlighted the relevance of postcolonial concepts such as \u201chybridity,\u201d \u201cmiddle ground,\u201d and \u201cthird space\u201d for the interpretation of archaeological data in ancient zones of contact such as Cyprus. In the case of Cypriote divine iconography during the first millennium B.C.E., a postcolonial approach suggests additional ways of thinking about novel identities produced in the context of local sanctuaries.\r\n \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32059719, "asset_id": 464373, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 352831, "first_name": "Derek", "last_name": "Counts", "domain_name": "uwm", "page_name": "DerekBCounts", "display_name": "Derek Counts", "profile_url": "https://uwm.academia.edu/DerekBCounts?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/352831/94685/45943462/s65_derek.counts.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3789, "name": "Cypriot Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cypriot_Archaeology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7482, "name": "Ancient Mediterranean Religions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Mediterranean_Religions?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8536, "name": "Hybridization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridization?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13995, "name": "Postcolonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 17618, "name": "Greek Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Greek_Archaeology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 32780, "name": "Mediterranean archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mediterranean_archaeology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 74525, "name": "Theory of Cultural Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theory_of_Cultural_Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 89312, "name": "Archaeology of Religion/divine Iconography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_Religion_divine_Iconography?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 89493, "name": "Herakles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Herakles?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 72198546, "title": "Reconnect: Cultural Content and Audiences in the Digital Environment", "created_at": "2022-02-22T01:45:24.233-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/72198546/Reconnect_Cultural_Content_and_Audiences_in_the_Digital_Environment?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_72198546", "summary": "Several studies have addressed the challenges faced by cultural and creative professionals and businesses since the emergence of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Some success stories have surfaced around larger organizations that managed to adapt quickly because they had been preparing for the digital era. The focus of the study presented here adds the much-needed viewpoint of those individuals who form the target audiences and are vital for the future of any CCI organization. These are the results of a public survey aimed at informing directly cultural organizations that experiment with new creative approaches and are adjusting to the transformations that have taken place. Findings are vital for organizations from smaller cultural markets while key conclusions shed light on the new disposition of the public towards existing and future formats of cultural offers online that are valid for contemporary audiences in general. These cover several key observations regarding the most popular type of cultural content and events online; the engagement rate of different audience groups; the most preferred duration of culture in video format; gender affinities influencing the engagement with cultural content online; the motivations and barriers for attending cultural events online, ways to keep the audiences informed, and finally, which new forms of cultural and creative offers would the public be willing to attend online in the recent future. The article demonstrates that knowing the target audience and using data analytics on public dispositions while creating new content can empower CCI organizations. This claim is also based on the successful experience of pilot offers created by CCIs that have benefited directly from the research results of Intercultura Consult's 2021 project. Work continues in a new project empowering cultural organizations to incubate experimental offers (digital dimension including). The goal is to enhance their connection with key audiences.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81221798, "asset_id": 72198546, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4140693, "first_name": "Petya", "last_name": "Koleva", "domain_name": "independentresearcher", "page_name": "PetyaKoleva", "display_name": "Petya Koleva", "profile_url": "https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/PetyaKoleva?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4140693/2074347/17673908/s65_petya.koleva.jpg"}, {"id": 8504859, "first_name": "Milena", "last_name": "Berbenkova", "domain_name": "uni-sofia", "page_name": "MilenaBerbenkova", "display_name": "Milena Berbenkova", "profile_url": "https://uni-sofia.academia.edu/MilenaBerbenkova?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8504859/44172627/34862152/s65_milena.berbenkova.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 945, "name": "Performing Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performing_Arts?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3143, "name": "Audience Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Audience_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5324, "name": "Virtualization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Virtualization?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5583, "name": "Audience and Reception Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Audience_and_Reception_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7831, "name": "Management of Innovation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Management_of_Innovation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7860, "name": "Cultural Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Tourism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 15869, "name": "Online Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Online_Learning?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 21555, "name": "Open Innovation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Open_Innovation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 36009, "name": "Public sector accounting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_sector_accounting?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 40719, "name": "Museums", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museums?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 62890, "name": "Hybridit\u00e9 culturelle", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridite_culturelle?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 181456, "name": "Cultural Industry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Industry?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 350691, "name": "Media and Communications.

The hybridity concept has been embraced by scholars and practitioners in response to the social and institutional complexities of peacebuilding and development practice. In particular, the concept appears well-suited to making sense of the mutually constitutive outcomes of processes of interaction between diverse norms, institutions, actors and discourses in the context of contemporary peacebuilding and development engagements. At the same time, it has been criticised from a variety of perspectives for overlooking critical questions of history, power and scale. The authors in this interdisciplinary collection draw on their in\u2011depth knowledge of peacebuilding and development contexts in different parts of Asia, the Pacific and Africa to examine the messy and dynamic realities of hybridity \u2018on the ground\u2019.

The Melaka Chettis are descendants of traders from the Indian subcontinent who married local women, mostly during the time of the Melaka Malay Empire from the 1400s to 1500s. The Melaka Chettis adopted the local lingua franca \u2018bahasa Melayu\u2019 or Malay as their first language together with the \u2018adat\u2019 (Malay meaning \u2018customs\u2019) of the Malay people, their traditional mannerisms and also their literary prowess. Not only did the Melaka Chettis successfully adopted the literary traditions of the Malay people, they also adapted these arts forms to become part of their own unique hybrid identities based on their worldviews and lived experiences within the Malay Peninsula or more famously known as the Golden Chersonese / Khersonese.

The Russian novel is manifest in the French novel in two ways: implicitly by the moral reflections on the divine justice and the human justice, and explicitly by many elements of the text (title, epigraph, paratexts, quotations, paraphrases etc.). Being a lot more than a simple pastiche, the French novel is indeed the rewriting of the famous crime committed by Raskolnikov. It is its intertextuality which makes the novel of Rahimi a kind of dialogue with the novel of Dostoevsky on the mode of the rewriting of the reflections and the reformulation of the questions developed in the work of the latter. What are the similarities and the fundamental differences between the character of Rassoul, main character of Rahimi, and that of Raskolnikov, protagonist of Dostoevsky? How has Rassoul become a failed pasticheur? What punishment are they to be subjected to in a country engulfed in an endless fratricidal war?

Titanen, Giganten und einzelne Riesenfiguren sind in dieser Gattung kontinuierlich pr\u00e4sent und lassen eine Vielzahl von Funktionalisierungen im jeweiligen Werkkontext erkennen. Dazu geh\u00f6ren insbesondere ihr hybrides Wesen, ihre Bedeutung f\u00fcr die Darstellung literarischer R\u00e4ume oder ihre Rolle als Vergleichsfolien in Gleichnissen zur Figurencharakterisierung.\r\n\r\nVielfach erm\u00f6glichen diese Verwendungsarten auch poetologische Reflexionen zur Werkprogrammatik der Epen. Anhand ausgew\u00e4hlter Passagen aus Homer, Hesiod, Apollonios Rhodios, Valerius Flaccus und Quintus Smyrnaeus werden diese Funktionalisierungen systematisch untersucht. Bei der Interpretation werden neben etablierten literaturtheoretischen Methoden wie Intertextualit\u00e4t, Narratologie und Wirkungs\u00e4sthetik auch neuere Ans\u00e4tze zur Hybridit\u00e4t und Geopoetik herangezogen. \r\n\r\nRezensionen: \r\nS.

This paper investigates novels and short stories that were published in Italy between the 1980s and the first decade of the 21st century. The aim of this study is to underline those elements of texts that are especially prone to transgression, which is understood as breaking aesthetic rules of literariness. This investigation presents the idea that crossing borders of literariness and negating well-known standards takes place especially in three areas. Firstly, it takes place on the stylistic and linguistic level, by using linguistic means that, up to this point, were not considered to be correct in literature (spoken language, jargon, dialects, specialised language), or by using phonosymbolic effects, poetic effects, and archaic stylisation, causing changes in spelling, morphology, and syntax. Secondly, current transgressive literature, on the textual level, is characterised by a certain hybridity, that is, a tendency to include in a literary work various types of texts, including non-literary ones (theatre plays, encyclopaedic entries, advertisement slogans, quotations from handbooks, etc.). A third example of transgressive aesthetics is the manipulation in narrative structure of the work, which especially underlines the significance of the reader, mainly by directly addressing him or her or placing the reader as one of the characters participating in the narration. The manipulation of narrative structure negates the classic idea of diegesis development and allows for a reflection on metafiction.

If David Harvey, as a social historian, sets in his study on rebel cities the age-old question \u2018what kind of city we want\u2019, this article aims to re-address the question within the context of museums and exhibitions that deal with contemporary urban utopias, dystopias and networks of urban experiences and ask what kind of city museums we need in contemporary societies. It discusses how museums of cities are living systems of tremendous scale and potential which embody a hybridity of cultures and employ an array of modalities that tell different stories of the world. It also reflects on urban museology through a systems thinking lens and sets new questions on key social issues about cities and museums of cities.\r\n\r\n\u039f\u03b9

This paper explores a dual aspect of hybridity to highlight a tension. Understood as a descriptor of contingent realities that emerge after the international\u2013local encounter, hybridity requires acknowledging that peacebuilders can do little to shape the course of events. Yet, framed as a process that can enable the pursuit of empowering solutions embedded in plurality and relationality, hybridity encourages forms of interventionism that may perpetuate the binaries and exclusions usually associated to the liberal peace paradigm. The paper suggests that when hybridity is used to improve peacebuilding practice, an opportunity may be missed to open up this tension and analytically discuss options, including withdrawal which, whilst largely left out of the conceptual picture, may be relevant to calls for reclaiming the self-governance of the subjects of peacebuilding themselves.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56878920, "asset_id": 36586031, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 19159042, "first_name": "Elisa", "last_name": "Randazzo", "domain_name": "ucl", "page_name": "ElisaRandazzo", "display_name": "Elisa Randazzo", "profile_url": "https://ucl.academia.edu/ElisaRandazzo?f_ri=4138", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45578, "name": "Peacebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peacebuilding?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 219163, "name": "Liberal Peacebuilding, Hybrid Peace, Hybrid Political Orders", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liberal_Peacebuilding_Hybrid_Peace_Hybrid_Political_Orders?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 34583658, "title": "Seeing like Borders: Convergence Zone as a Post-Zomian Model", "created_at": "2017-09-16T09:45:40.799-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34583658/Seeing_like_Borders_Convergence_Zone_as_a_Post_Zomian_Model?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_34583658", "summary": "This article examines the interests and concerns of two ethnic communities straddling the Sino-Tibetan borderlands\u2014the Gyalrongwa and Qiangzu\u2014in the reconfigurations of their relations with the Chinese state, the Han, the Tibetans, and with each other, especially since 2008. I argue that both the Gyalrongwa and Qiangzu employ various tactics for their anticipated goals, notably strategic marginality, dissimilation through analogy, or the marginal\u2019s scapegoating, partly as responses to the Tibetan unrest and Sichuan earthquake. The differences and similarities in their authenticity and other claims as well as the approaches and strategies adopted are primarily outcomes of their hybridized identities and their marginal status vis-\u00e0-vis the Han state and Tibetans in history and at present. Above all, I adopt and expand the natural science convergence zone concept to identify multifarious manifestations and layers of the center-periphery paradigm as well as processes and effects of convergences among multiple external and internal forces at borders and margins. In provoking a further critical analysis and comparison, I bring forth Hong Kong\u2019s unique role as both a world metropolis and a peripheral Chinese city. I then conclude with open-ended questions regarding this theoretical model\u2019s prospects and challenges in examining and comparing a diverse range of borders and margins (and beyond) across time and space, including various subcultures in urban and other settings.\r\n\r\nP.S.

Depicting his lifelike pilgrims in accordance with the social, economic and political changes of the time, one of the focal points Chaucer highlights in his The Canterbury Tales is social mobility which moulds the portrait of his old landowner, the Franklin. Due to social mobility, as in the case of his real counterparts in history, the portrayal of the Franklin is shaped by in-betweenness since he is a social climber without a noble birth. The Franklin, a rich social climber of peasant origin, embraces the characteristics of both his previous and present social position and inhabits a medieval \" third space. \" Not entirely belonging to the nobility or to the commoners, parvenu Franklin is in an identity crisis and belongs to the medieval \" middle grouping \" of social climbers apart from the members of the traditional three estates: the clergy, the nobility and the commoners. Those people of \" middle-grouping \" develop their alternative identities on the borders of the acknowledged identities of the three medieval estates. Thereupon, the Franklin has to develop a hybrid identity by mimicking his social superiors, the members of the nobility, to be able to find a place for himself in society. Accordingly, this paper aims to discuss Chaucer's Franklin in The Canterbury Tales as a Bhabhanian hybrid and mimic who is caught in between the medieval acknowledged identities of the commoners and the nobility, and searches for a recognisable identity in dynamic medieval society.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53720044, "asset_id": 33724485, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13716739, "first_name": "Nazan", "last_name": "Y\u0131ld\u0131z", "domain_name": "ktu", "page_name": "NazanY\u0131ld\u0131z", "display_name": "Nazan  Y\u0131ld\u0131z", "profile_url": "https://ktu.academia.edu/NazanY%C4%B1ld%C4%B1z?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13716739/3816160/79337782/s65_nazan.y_ld_z.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1228, "name": "Medieval Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_Literature?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2853, "name": "Medieval Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23791, "name": "Third Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Third_Space?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33542, "name": "Geoffrey Chaucer", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geoffrey_Chaucer?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 642108, "name": "The canterbury tales", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_canterbury_tales?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 33395890, "title": "HIBRIDISMO CULTURAL E ENSINO DE L\u00cdNGUA INGLESA EM UMA PERSPECTIVA DE LETRAMENTO CR\u00cdTICO", "created_at": "2017-06-09T14:36:46.472-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33395890/HIBRIDISMO_CULTURAL_E_ENSINO_DE_L%C3%8DNGUA_INGLESA_EM_UMA_PERSPECTIVA_DE_LETRAMENTO_CR%C3%8DTICO?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_33395890", "summary": "On cultural hybridity and ELT in a critical literacy perspective", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53451359, "asset_id": 33395890, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4666762, "first_name": "William", "last_name": "Tagata", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "WilliamTagata", "display_name": "William Tagata", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/WilliamTagata?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4666762/1960499/15796493/s65_william.tagata.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4474, "name": "Critical Thinking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Thinking?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 126788, "name": "English Language Teaching (ELT)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Language_Teaching_ELT_?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 31849966, "title": "Le sein du serpent.

Si son travail du trait et de la couleur identifient imm\u00e9diatement son dessin, sa sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 s'affirme aussi par la pr\u00e9sence du divin de ses \u0153uvres\u00a0: le panth\u00e9on \u00e9gyptien de La foire aux immortels (1980), la naissance c\u00e9leste d'Immortel, ad vitam (2004), ou le chaos primordial d'Animal'Z (2009) \u2013\u00a0parcours complexe de la mythologie \u00e0 la transcendance, puis de la transcendance \u00e0 la cosmogonie.\r\nLa foire aux immortels (bande dessin\u00e9e) reprend la diff\u00e9rence cosmique traditionnelle entre le divin et l'humain. Si la pyramide, intemporelle, l\u00e9vite au-dessus de la Tour Eiffel, au-dessus d'une humanit\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9rive (l'\u00e2ge de fer d'H\u00e9siode dans Les travaux et les jours), un bloc s'en est effrit\u00e9, laissant s'\u00e9chapper Horus, dieu transgresseur qui va s'hybrider \u00e0 un homme et aimer une femme. Le r\u00e9cit prend vie sur une brisure de l'ordre cosmique. Le divin mythologique, stylis\u00e9, \u00e0 la fois familier et d\u00e9cal\u00e9, est transpos\u00e9 dans un temps d\u00e9cadent, hant\u00e9 par l'hybridit\u00e9, l'hubris.\r\nLa tension s'approfondit dans le film Immortel, ad vitam. Le panth\u00e9on dispara\u00eet pour une m\u00e9taphysique de la transcendance. L'\u00e9v\u00e9nement cosmique d'un n\u0153ud d'immortalit\u00e9 accouche d'une nouvelle forme de divin. Ici, l'hybridit\u00e9 se d\u00e9multiplie\u00a0: homme-dieu, homme-animal, homme-machine, hybridit\u00e9 formelle entre film et bande dessin\u00e9e, entre images de synth\u00e8se et acteurs.\r\nEnfin, dans Animal'Z et Julia & Roem, \u00e0 la fois bandes dessin\u00e9es et sc\u00e9narios de film, le divin n'a plus ni forme ni figure, mais devient pure puissance. Nous sommes dans le travail du mythe le plus radical, celui des fins et des origines. La Terre se convulse dans un \u00ab\u00a0coup de sang\u00a0\u00bb qui explose tous les rep\u00e8res et renouvelle tous les possibles \u2013\u00a0noces du cosmos et du chaos. L'hybridit\u00e9 est dans toutes choses, y compris dans les temps, les lieux, les \u00eatres et les r\u00e9cits. L'amour entre Julia et Roem, conjugu\u00e9 au \u00ab\u00a0coup de sang\u00a0\u00bb, est autant une mise \u00e0 mort qu'un accouchement du monde, de l'humanit\u00e9 et du divin.",

The focus is set on the relations between materiality and the \u2018cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire\u2019 rather than in terms of representation, symbolisation or style. It is argued that patchworks, unfinished motifs, re-cuts and hybrids are more interesting ways to understand the complex relations between the social and the ritual aspects of petroglyphing. The approach is illustrated by a horizontal stratigraphy of the Hemsta panel in the parish of Uppland, in southern Sweden. Here a sequence of at least three separate phases of activity is distinguished. The study emphasizes the changing importance of space, depth and size in the process of making and arranging the motifs \u2013 suggesting that the development is a part of a social and ritual turbulence resembling the process of hybridity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30692457, "asset_id": 2157084, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

proposition that there is an emerging phenomenon\r\nof tectonic hybridisation in contemporary architecture in Africa where global\r\nand local ways of making are being combined. A growing awareness of this\r\ntendency was informed by an extended period of practicing, teaching, and researching\r\narchitectural technology in Africa. I embarked on a directed search\r\nfor examples that demonstrate this, but I soon realised that they are shaped by\r\nongoing tectonic transitions that highlight the encounters between techno and\r\ntechn\u0113, between the global and the local, and between the global North and\r\nthe global South. These binaries can and should be contested, and this study\r\nseeks to understand the underpinnings and tectonic strategies of buildings\r\nthat demonstrate evidence of this contestation.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of tectonic hybridisation was interrogated as a case\r\nstudy using mixed methods consisting of literature reviews, the identification,\r\ninvestigation and cataloguing of works, and the analysis of key projects through\r\nprimary sources and visual research methods. The literature review explored\r\ndifferent positions related to techn\u0113, technology and tectonics, and considered\r\ntheories that range from Bhabha\u2019s reading of hybridisation to Frampton,\r\nLefaivre and Tzonis\u2019 development of Critical Regionalism. In parallel, a catalogue\r\nof buildings that exhibit a tendency towards hybridisation was produced\r\nand developed into an open access website. Subsequent analysis of this uncovered\r\ncommon strategies across projects which could be located within the\r\nspectrum of global and local tectonics. Further examination revealed buildings\r\nthat share similar tectonic strategies, which often coalesce into constellations,\r\nand key projects within these were identified for more detailed investigation.\r\nData was gathered through personal interviews with the architects, site visits,\r\nseminars, additional literature review, and in some instances, through co-production.\r\nThe data was then analysed further through cross-comparison in the\r\nform of tables, discursive textual comparison, and visual research methods.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these investigations, a significant number of works that\r\nsignal a shift towards hybridisation are revealed.

Hybrid art-making raises questions of how we evaluate the legitimacy of global and indigenous art forms in a context where hybridity is the norm.

To do so, it examines how speakers make certain types of hybrid identities (im)possible through their discursive practices of scaling. Focusing on post-soviet, Central Asian migrants in the United States, I demonstrate how their discourses on ethnolinguistic identity rely on multiple scalar perspectives, which (re)make boundaries in different ways that (dis)allow for hybrid identities to emerge. I show that speakers engage in such discourses in order to navigate their marginal transnational positionings, and that their emergent hybrid identities do not ensure resistance to national norms or transcend categorical boundaries.

With increasing publication has come a demand for translations of these texts. While some authors readily choose to translate their work, others are closer in line with Gloria Anzald\u00faa who said \u201cUntil I can take pride in my language I cannot take pride in myself... Until I am free to write bilingually and to switch codes without having always to translate, while I still have to speak English or Spanish when I would rather speak Spanglish, and as long as I have to accommodate the English speakers rather than having them accommodate me, my tongue will be illegitimate\u201d (1999: 81).  This hesitation to accommodate English speakers fails to consider that approximately 2/3 of them are non-native speakers. Consequently, the role that English can play in south-to-south translation is not negligible and \u201chaving\u201d to translate because of the existing English hegemony in the US Latinx context is not the same as choosing to translate for any of a number of other motivating factors. Both are equally legitimate options, but this begs the question, is there a way to translate Spanglish so that English readers can access it without \u201caccommodating\u201d the English hegemony? This paper explores intralingual translation rather than normative interlingual translation as a tool to expand the readership of these texts while not fully assimilating them into the traditional English publication norms.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60221057, "asset_id": 38339026, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1765480, "first_name": "Remy", "last_name": "Attig", "domain_name": "bgsu", "page_name": "RemyAttig", "display_name": "Remy Attig", "profile_url": "https://bgsu.academia.edu/RemyAttig?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1765480/605142/59838153/s65_remy.attig.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 298, "name": "Latino/A Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latino_A_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1186, "name": "Translation Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2940, "name": "Latina/o Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latina_o_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 33860, "name": "Spanglish", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spanglish?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 87925, "name": "US Latino Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/US_Latino_Literature?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 38203371, "title": "Reading Primo Levi on \u201chybridity\u201d in the context of South Africa: Moving towards humanizing descriptions of the other", "created_at": "2019-01-23T01:16:30.849-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38203371/Reading_Primo_Levi_on_hybridity_in_the_context_of_South_Africa_Moving_towards_humanizing_descriptions_of_the_other?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_38203371", "summary": "Primo Levi discovered his otherness \u2013 his Jewish identity \u2013 by experiencing discrimination: through the anti-Semitic laws enforced by  the Fascist regime in the 1930\u2019s and the year of imprisonment in Auschwitz.

In this article I explore Levi\u2019s literary writings on hybridity and relate them to South African theologian Nico Koopman, who proposes a pedagogy of hybridity to support pluralistic societies in moving from alienation and oppression to human dignity and freedom.

Reaching the Torah service, I opened the scroll, showed the beginning of Sefer Shemot to the kids, leyned a couple of verses, and took out several colorful pictures of Pharaoh, Yoheved, Aaron and Miriam, the pyramids, and baby Moses in his basket on the Nile. I knew that the children had heard the story at least once before, so I asked them what they saw on the pictures while re-telling the story and pointing out some details they missed. When we reached the picture of little Moses in his reed basket, I asked the children who that little baby was \u2013 and it was then that I heard the clear voice of a confident little girl answering me proudly: \" That's little baby Jesus! \" This little scene occurred in the liberal Jewish community in Hanover, Germany. But in fact, it could have happened also here in the United States. Obviously, this former little congregant of mine had been exposed to the Christian narrative in quite a formative manner; maybe through grandparents , one of her parents, or even just a babysitter or a friend of the family. Whoever told her about little baby Jesus had, I am sure, the best intentions. And the fact that many Jewish children and adults are listening to different cultural and religious narratives today is, first and foremost, a simple fact; an element of the reality we share today.

The textual examination that I conduct in this article illuminates anxieties over the ideological construct of the \u201cnatural\u201d body as it was positioned against the constructs of socialisation and civilisation in the late nineteenth century and identified with concepts of gross materiality (such as bodily fluids) and the organic (the living, breathing body set against the cold corpse). I argue that late nineteenth-century nostalgia for and simultaneous disgust with a \u201cnatural\u201d Pierrot influenced the development of techniques of mime based on minimalist movement. Minimalist here refers to small and contained bodily movements that are discernible only at close proximity, a mechanised performance style marked by rapid, rigid movements associated with the automaton\u2014set against the \u201cnatural\u201d body as identified with the fluid and organic.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54378153, "asset_id": 34513022, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3663483, "first_name": "Laura", "last_name": "Purcell-Gates", "domain_name": "bathspa", "page_name": "LPurcellGates", "display_name": "Laura  Purcell-Gates", "profile_url": "https://bathspa.academia.edu/LPurcellGates?f_ri=4138", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3190, "name": "Puppetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Puppetry?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8671, "name": "Abjection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Abjection?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14617, "name": "Phenomenology of the body", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology_of_the_body?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44995, "name": "Mime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mime?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 211381, "name": "Grotesque, Abject,uncanny", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Grotesque_Abject_uncanny?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2040495, "name": "Pierrot", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pierrot?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 12138428, "title": "Selling, Sharing, and Everything in Between: The Hybrid Economies of Collaborative Networks ", "created_at": "2015-04-28T07:43:19.294-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12138428/Selling_Sharing_and_Everything_in_Between_The_Hybrid_Economies_of_Collaborative_Networks?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_12138428", "summary": "Recent consumer research has examined contexts where market-based exchange, gift-giving,\nsharing, and other modes of exchange occur simultaneously and obey several intersecting logics,\nbut has not conceptualized these so-called hybrid economic forms, nor explained how these\nhybrids are shaped and sustained.

article lies in the analysis on ethnicity and identity in an under-explored geographical/ethnic context, that is the Greek second generation in Italy. Through a field research, the article analyses second generation Greek migrants' process of identity construction, highlighting the emergence of a network of multiple and hybrid belongings as well as a combination of identities and dialectical positions. The field research findings show that hybrid belongings contradict the idea of cultural purity by revealing that all cultures are hybrid all along. In fact, self-representation and self-identification of the Greek second generation challenge traditional paradigms of ethnicity entailing a reworking of pre-existing hybridity rather than any simple combination of Italian and Greek identities. Another key argument that emerged from this fieldwork is the importance of the specific context, positions and conditions in which hybridity operates.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50536811, "asset_id": 30084663, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8298382, "first_name": "Andrea", "last_name": "Pelliccia", "domain_name": "cnr-it", "page_name": "AndreaPelliccia", "display_name": "Andrea Pelliccia", "profile_url": "https://cnr-it.academia.edu/AndreaPelliccia?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8298382/2833907/77567287/s65_andrea.pelliccia.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 124954, "name": "Greekness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Greekness?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 388870, "name": "Hybrid Identities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybrid_Identities?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 467318, "name": "Second Generation Migrants", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_Generation_Migrants?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 27955034, "title": "Hybridity: Marrism and the Problems of Language of the Imperial Situation", "created_at": "2016-08-23T05:22:37.146-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27955034/Hybridity_Marrism_and_the_Problems_of_Language_of_the_Imperial_Situation?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_27955034", "summary": "This article revisits Joseph Stalin\u2019s infamous 1950 critique of Nikolai Marr\u2019s controversial linguistic theory as a \u201clinguistic turn,\u201d to borrow a modern concept. The authors argue that this was literally a shift in the language describing social diversity, rather than a purely ideological campaign as earlier studies suggested. Stalin explicitly insisted on the academic nature of his intervention, which was quite banal in terms of its theoretical input, reproducing standard theses of classic linguistic theory from prerevolutionary textbooks. One aspect, however, was both theoretical and original: the elaborate attack on the concept of \u201ccrossing\u201d (skreshchenie) of languages as the driving force of linguistic processes, the central and most stable element of the evolving theory of Nikolai Marr and his disciples. \nBy reviewing the intellectual context of the forming of Marr\u2019s theory during the first two decades of the twentieth century (including cases of physical anthropology, archaeology, and nonclassical linguistics), the article claims that Nikolai Marr\u2019s scholarly pursuits were but a specific case of rethinking and constructing the language of hybridity. Modern social sciences in Russia have produced a distinct metalanguage to describe and analyze the complex diversity of imperial situation. \u201cHybridity\u201d was the central trope of this metalanguage, or rather its equivalents at the time \u2013 \u201cmixing\u201d (smeshenie) and \u201ccrossing\u201d (skreshchenie) \u2013 insofar as \u201chybridity\u201d had not yet entered the Russian vocabulary. It is in this sense that \u201chybridity\u201d is discussed in this article: as a language of self-description in the imperial situation (category of practice) and as an element of the analytical language of the project of modern imperial social sciences, rather than a direct importation of the concept of hybridity from contemporary postcolonial scholarship (as used by Homi Bhabha and others).\nThe emergence of scholarly models that explicitly used the trope of hybridity and perceived hybridity as a foundation of the norm (rather than a marginal condition of deviation from pure forms) is characterized here as the late imperial epistemological revolution. This epistemological revolution became possible and had potential in the context of the imperial situation and in the ideologically pluralistic regime of the late empire. It was already exhausted by the late 1920s, having received support from neither the hegemonic Soviet discourse nor from the subaltern Eurasianist or Soviet national and anticolonial projects. Methodological constructivism and hybridity as a whole became obsolete as survivals of the unstable and limited pluralism of the New Economic Policy era. Their final marginalization in the USSR was just a question of time, given the consolidation of the Stalinist regime throughout the 1930s and the stake on the Russian nation as the official Staatsvolk. The upheaval of World War II delayed the official correction of the metalanguage of social hybridity based on the controversial Marrist linguistic theory of \u201ccrossing,\u201d until Stalin\u2019s \u201clinguistic turn\u201d of 1950 formally established the foundations of the literally \u201ccounterrevolutionary\u201d episteme of \u201csimple things\u201d and the project of the ideological state based on that episteme.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48254737, "asset_id": 27955034, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4794305, "first_name": "Ilya", "last_name": "Gerasimov", "domain_name": "abimperio", "page_name": "IlyaGerasimov", "display_name": "Ilya Gerasimov", "profile_url": "https://abimperio.academia.edu/IlyaGerasimov?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4794305/2042667/11932317/s65_ilya.gerasimov.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1567, "name": "Soviet History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soviet_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13995, "name": "Postcolonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Theory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15455, "name": "Russian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 89069, "name": "Russian Modernism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian_Modernism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 196247, "name": "Linguistic Turn", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Turn?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 716677, "name": "Joseph Stalin", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Joseph_Stalin?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 892993, "name": "New Imperial History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Imperial_History-1?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2517520, "name": "Nikolai Marr", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nikolai_Marr?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 26903582, "title": "Anthropocene Politics II, Democratic Natures, Public Ecologies Chpt 10 of White/Rudy/Gareau Environments, Natures and Social Theory (Palgrave, 2016)", "created_at": "2016-07-11T13:18:44.036-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26903582/Anthropocene_Politics_II_Democratic_Natures_Public_Ecologies_Chpt_10_of_White_Rudy_Gareau_Environments_Natures_and_Social_Theory_Palgrave_2016_?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_26903582", "summary": "Who speaks for the anthropocene?

In the final chapter of this book, we will sketch out a rather different set of attempts to imagine a critical hybrid politics beyond business as usual. All the currents we will look at in this chapter argue that if a defining feature of our hybrid worlds is that these are worlds that have to be composed, then the making of this anthropocene is inherently a political act. All the currents we will engage with here believe that questions of equity and justice have to be foregrounded in discussions about hybrid futures. Finally, to one degree or another, all these currents believe that publics have to be closely involved in the composition of our common home, that in short we need something like a public ecology (Luke, 2009). We will see in this chapter though that there is a considerably broad range of ideas as to how we might imagine the flourishing of public ecologies. This chapter identifies four sometimes-overlapping discussions that attempt to think and enact a critical hybrid politics.

Arguably, young people are more susceptible to these threats as they appear to have greater access to multiple media. In recent times, as media globalisation has steadily deepened, celebrity culture has been identified as a growing phenomenon, emerging with the rise in popular culture. The media both glamourise and glorify the lives of celebrities and this, according to research, has surprising influences on the lives of youth. This study examines, in the context of Nigeria, whether celebrity culture is being appropriated by Nigerian youth through their vicarious experiences of the media. A further aim is to establish whether such appropriation has any influence on their social behaviours and attitudes. Drawing respondents from undergraduate students at two universities in Nigeria, and employing qualitative and quantitative methodologies, the study has found that indications are rife of Western celebrity culture being perpetuated by both mainstream and alternative media, and that this is fast catching up with Nigerian youth\u2019s cultural experiences.

Where post-colonial theory had focussed on destruction and appropriation, hybridity focuses on exchange, examining the processes of mutual discovery and influence between imperial and vassal cultures.  Never has a literary classic\u2014already several hundred years old\u2014so powerfully spurred an historical movement as did Shakespeare\u2019s Tempest for mid-20th century post-colonialism.  (A leading figure like the Martiniquais poet and statesman Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire would altogether re-write the play to mirror that simultaneously political and intellectual revolution.)  This essay witnesses the progression of post-colonial theory into the new century.  If The Tempest long stood as \u2018the\u2019 post-colonial drama in the Shakespearean corpus, it can now re-join the lesser known Cymbeline, which was written around the same time and serves largely as a companion piece.  Together the two plays elicit the distinctly hybrid nature of cultural exchange within imperial power structures.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 91309203, "asset_id": 20138792, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1819541, "first_name": "Eric", "last_name": "Heinze", "domain_name": "qmul", "page_name": "EricHeinze", "display_name": "Eric  Heinze", "profile_url": "https://qmul.academia.edu/EricHeinze?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1819541/620685/6270611/s65_eric.heinze.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 546, "name": "Comparative Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Law?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3021, "name": "Colonial America", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_America?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3115, "name": "Posthumanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Posthumanism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3146, "name": "Shakespeare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shakespeare?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3354, "name": "Poststructuralism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poststructuralism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5372, "name": "Post-Marxism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Marxism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7724, "name": "Law and Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_and_Literature?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 10101, "name": "Critical Posthumanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Posthumanism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 10444, "name": "Postmodernism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postmodernism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 12181, "name": "French colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_colonialism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13995, "name": "Postcolonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 -

In the course of the centuries, this crossbreeding creates a popular catholic imaginary where the \u201cfinado\u201d \u2013 the spirit of the deceased \u2013 settles as one of the society\u2019s cements. By its symbolic control on the fate of these migrants\u2019 families stuck between here and there, the spirit of the deceased becomes the common denominator between the native and the migrant, the young and the elderly, the popular and the intellectual, the Catholic and the Protestant, the continental and the islander, the African and the European.\nWhether he\u2019s \u201cwandering\u201d \u2013 inferior \u2013 or \u201cluminous\u201d \u2013 superior \u2013, the spirit of the deceased is also the entity convoked in the Christian rationalism in order to re-create link. It is not surprising as this spiritualistic doctrine born in Brazil in 1910 has spread abroad mainly through the Cape Verdean Diaspora. Its \"irradiations\" and sessions of psychic \u201ccleansing\u201d and \u201cduplication\u201d directed to the whole world, make it a delocalized spirituality, able to connect the human fates beyond the geopolitical borders.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38813523, "asset_id": 15860981, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5666400, "first_name": "Laurent", "last_name": "Pierre-Joseph", "domain_name": "uclouvain", "page_name": "LaurentPierreJoseph", "display_name": "Laurent Pierre-Joseph", "profile_url": "https://uclouvain.academia.edu/LaurentPierreJoseph?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5666400/2463456/2862845/s65_laurent.pierre-joseph.jpg"}, {"id": 34985680, "first_name": "Laap - UCL", "last_name": "Laboratoire d'Anthropologie Prospective", "domain_name": "uclouvain", "page_name": "LaapUCLLaboratoiredAnthropologieProspective", "display_name": "Laap - UCL Laboratoire d'Anthropologie Prospective", "profile_url": "https://uclouvain.academia.edu/LaapUCLLaboratoiredAnthropologieProspective?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/34985680/10187292/11368374/s65_laap_-_ucl.laboratoire_d_anthropologie_prospective.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22348, "name": "Witchcraft (Anthropology Of Religion)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Witchcraft_Anthropology_Of_Religion_?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52538, "name": "Cape Verde", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cape_Verde?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 242778, "name": "Insularity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Insularity?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 12438184, "title": "The Hybridity of Liberal Peace: States, Diasporas and Insecurity", "created_at": "2015-05-18T02:30:34.160-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12438184/The_Hybridity_of_Liberal_Peace_States_Diasporas_and_Insecurity?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_12438184", "summary": "Much contemporary analysis of world order rests on and reproduces a dualistic account of the international system, which is divided into liberal and non-liberal spaces, practices and subjectivities. Drawing on postcolonial thought, we challenge such dualisms in two ways. First, we argue that, as a specific form of governmental reason and practice produced at the intersection of the European and the non-European worlds, liberalism has always been hybrid, encompassing within its project both \u2018liberal\u2019 and \u2018non-liberal\u2019 spaces and practices. Second, through analysis of liberal engagement with diasporas, a specific set of subjects that occupy both these spaces, we show how contemporary practices of transnational security governance work to reproduce the hybridity of liberal peace. The article demonstrates the shifting conditions for local agency in relations and practices that transcend the simple dualism between liberal and non-liberal spaces, in the process showing how practices of transnational security governance also reproduce diasporas as hybrid subjects. The argument is illustrated with reference to the Tamil diaspora and the Sri Lankan state\u2019s war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37779674, "asset_id": 12438184, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 568261, "first_name": "Suthaharan", "last_name": "Nadarajah", "domain_name": "soas", "page_name": "SuthaharanNadarajah", "display_name": "Suthaharan  Nadarajah", "profile_url": "https://soas.academia.edu/SuthaharanNadarajah?f_ri=4138", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2937, "name": "Diasporas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diasporas?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4568, "name": "Liberalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liberalism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9850, "name": "Sri Lanka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lanka?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13995, "name": "Postcolonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Theory?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 11408147, "title": "The Mickey Mouse Kachina and Other \"Double Objects\": Hybridity in the Material Culture of Colonial Encounters", "created_at": "2015-03-13T07:33:14.181-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11408147/The_Mickey_Mouse_Kachina_and_Other_Double_Objects_Hybridity_in_the_Material_Culture_of_Colonial_Encounters?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_11408147", "summary": "Hybridity is a term used by anthropologists to characterize the amalgamation of influences from two (or more) different cultural groups.  Hybridity has captivated archaeology in recent years, especially archaeologists investigating colonialism in Native American contexts.  At the same time, a growing chorus of critics has begun to question anthropology\u2019s devotion to hybridity and hybrid objects.  These critics take issue with the term\u2019s alleged Eurocentrism, implications of cultural purity, and evolutionary etymology.  In this article I address these critiques and advocate a more circumscribed use of hybridity in archaeology.  I caution against the abandonment of the term entirely, because the archaeological identification of hybridity provides insights into both present-day (etic) and past (emic) perspectives on cultural amalgamation.  Hybridity reveals the biases of contemporary researchers regarding the societies we study, as well as highlighting the ways in which power structures centered and marginalized colonial subjects in the past. To illustrate these points I draw on case studies involving the Hopi Mickey Mouse kachina, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Indigenous-colonial whips from the American Plains and southeast Australia, and seventeenth-century Pueblo ceramics from the American Southwest.

However, while widely deployed, hybridity itself is under-theorized and variably applied by scholars. Major concerns arise, therefore, concerning the concept\u2019s usefulness for peacebuilding theory, policy and practice. Most problematically, while some scholars use hybridity descriptively to illustrate the mixing of international and local institutions, practices, rituals, and concepts, many today deploy hybridity prescriptively, implying that international actors can plan and administer hybridity to foster predictable social experiences in complex post-conflict states. This latter literature, therefore, assumes predictable relationships between the administration of hybrid institutions \u2013 of law, of governance, or of economics, for example \u2013 and the provision of peace promoting local experiences of those institutions; experiences of justice, authority, empowerment, etc.\r\nThis article argues that these assumptions are flawed and illustrates how a disaggregated theory of hybridity can avoid such errors. This theory distinguishes between four levels of hybridity \u2013 institutional, practical, ritual, and conceptual \u2013 characterized by their variable amenability to purposeful administration. The article illustrates how prescriptive approaches that assume direct and predictable relationships between institutions and experiences fail to recognize that concepts underpin local understandings and experiences of the world and, therefore, play a mediating role between institutions and experiences. Using examples from Sierra Leone, the article shows that while concepts are always hybrid, conceptual hybridity is inherently resistant to planned administration. As a result, internationally planned and administered hybrid institutions will not result in predictable experiences and may even result in negative or conflict promoting experiences. The paper illustrates the dangers of assuming any predictable relationships between the four levels of hybridity, and, therefore, between the administration of institutional hybrids and the predictable provision of positive local experiences.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40706237, "asset_id": 9813577, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 23656474, "first_name": "Gearoid", "last_name": "Millar", "domain_name": "aberdeen", "page_name": "GearoidMillar", "display_name": "Gearoid Millar", "profile_url": "https://aberdeen.academia.edu/GearoidMillar?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/23656474/6413692/7254889/s65_gearoid.millar.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9251, "name": "Transitional Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transitional_Justice?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13047, "name": "Sierra Leone", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sierra_Leone?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45578, "name": "Peacebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peacebuilding?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 8705124, "title": "Clair, R.

The findings suggest that some restaurants openly embraced hybridity, defied and debunked stereotypes, and resisted hegemonic constructions of individuals and of culture by enacting narratives of defiance, while others attempted to maintain traditional images or commodify the culture.

Or is this simply a matter of semantics, citation practices, and the adoption of yet another example of trendy anthropological jargon by archaeologists?   In this chapter I consider the meanings associated with the concept of hybridity, exploring what this term offers for the archaeological interpretation of colonial encounters.

Yet, this so-called strict hierarchy shaped by three estates was shuttered by the decline of feudalism due to the consequences of the Black Death, and Peasants' Revolt of 1381 in the late Middle Ages. Accordingly, the boundaries among the estates were blurred by social mobility which enabled the aspiring commoners to rise on the social ladder through wealth, marriage and royal favour, forming a new middle-class of social climbers. In time, the members of this new class, especially merchants, became stronger as they created close contacts with the members of the nobility. This closeness, however, established the base for an identity crisis bringing about hybridity for the social climbers as they were commoners aspiring to belong to the nobility, yet, this did not seem possible since they lacked noble blood. A keen observer of his time, Geoffrey Chaucer, widely accepted as the father of the English literature, dealt with the emergence of this new middle-class and the conflicts between this middle-class and the rest of the society in his masterpiece, the Canterbury Tales. To some critics, Chaucer's treatment of those conflicts was an attack on this new class as Chaucer himself favoured the social stability and hierarchy. Yet, there is an unavoidable fact that Chaucer himself, with his ambiguous status deriving from his conflicting mercantile (middle-class) and courtly (gentle) background, was one of the most significant representatives of those medieval hybrids of the late Middle Ages. Thereby, this article, analysing the related parts of the Canterbury Tales and Chaucer's related short poems, aims to discuss medieval hybrids, including Chaucer, who experienced hybridity as they were caught in between the fixed identities of their times and lived in a kind of \"third space\", as suggested by Homi K. Bhabha, in the borders of the three estates of the late fourteenth century.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80122441, "asset_id": 70321004, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13716739, "first_name": "Nazan", "last_name": "Y\u0131ld\u0131z", "domain_name": "ktu", "page_name": "NazanY\u0131ld\u0131z", "display_name": "Nazan  Y\u0131ld\u0131z", "profile_url": "https://ktu.academia.edu/NazanY%C4%B1ld%C4%B1z?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13716739/3816160/79337782/s65_nazan.y_ld_z.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2089, "name": "Social Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Identity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2367, "name": "Chaucer", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chaucer?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4805, "name": "Medieval English Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_English_Literature?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 33542, "name": "Geoffrey Chaucer", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geoffrey_Chaucer?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 53034, "name": "Cultural hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 74525, "name": "Theory of Cultural Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theory_of_Cultural_Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 81894, "name": "Middle Ages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_Ages?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 592045, "name": "Hybridity and Cultural Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity_and_Cultural_Identity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1862666, "name": "In-Betweenness in Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/In-Betweenness_in_Literature?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 44311786, "title": "Concrete Diaspora vs. Abstract Diaspora - Hybrid Texts: Translations and Original Writings", "created_at": "2020-10-16T11:36:39.877-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44311786/Concrete_Diaspora_vs_Abstract_Diaspora_Hybrid_Texts_Translations_and_Original_Writings?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_44311786", "summary": "The hybrid quality of a text can be the result of its being produced in an in-between space such as a diaspora.

The comparison is carried out using a model of hybridity which classifies manifestations of hybridness under three main approaches to hybridization. The results of the analysis illustrated that hybridity is not a quality peculiar to diasporic texts and texts developed in homeland can be hybrid too. This necessitated the rethinking of the definition of diaspora.

We develop an explanation for the endurance of traditional authorities, based on extensive fieldwork in one recently developed neighbourhood in a previously uninhabited part of Greater Accra, where we conducted interviews and analysed documents from the archives of the chief's Divisional Council. We show that the formation of a modern state has restricted the chiefs' discretion as sovereigns but afforded them greater power as managers of the land and gatekeepers of the state bureaucracy.

It aims to bring transmediality\nto a series of questions on racial and cultural\nimaginaries I articulated in other writings,\nespecially with relation to mestizaje and hybridity.\nAs these categories have been used to\nconstruct \u00abstable\u00bb cultural identities and have\nbeen theorized in order to deconstruct those\nsame identities (Bhabha, P\u00e9rez Torres), transmediality\nseems to reproduce a similar if not\nidentical movement, something G\u00f3mez Pe\u00f1a\u00b4s\nwork suggests by constantly juxtaposing the\ncategories.

discusses the fl uidity of ethnic categorization in the context of changing ethnic relations, based on a diachronic and regional approach. It is argued that such an approach is needed to understand identity trajectories of peoples of the Sino-Tibetan borderlands. While studies on minorities in China are often limited to one ethnic group, the perspective defended here considers the interactions between several groups in specific contexts, and at different scales, which contribute to determine shifts in identity. The analysis focuses on the Sino-Tibetan borderlands of today\u2019s Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, and the diverse and often Tibetanized groups located in these mountains. Taking into account the changing socio-political environment, mainly from the late Qing to the People\u2019s Republic of China, helps us to uncover a number of factors determining the identity formation of the groups\nunder consideration, and the persistence of a form of genealogical thinking. A range of cases is considered to provide comparative data at the regional level, supporting the degree of generality of the lability of ethnic categorization as well as identity changes, and the disjunctions between assigned categories, culture, language, and local identity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46033547, "asset_id": 20444768, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1234205, "first_name": "St\u00e9phane", "last_name": "Gros", "domain_name": "cnrs", "page_name": "St\u00e9phaneGros", "display_name": "St\u00e9phane Gros", "profile_url": "https://cnrs.academia.edu/St%C3%A9phaneGros?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1234205/9357083/10428927/s65_st_phane.gros.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2905, "name": "Tibetan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tibetan_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5815, "name": "Identity politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_politics?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12108, "name": "China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 16766, "name": "Anthropology of Tibet and the Himalayas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Tibet_and_the_Himalayas?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 18573, "name": "Categorization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Categorization?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 39146, "name": "Linguistic Diversity (Languages And Linguistics)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Diversity_Languages_And_Linguistics_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 65065, "name": "Interethnic Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interethnic_Relations?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 487617, "name": "History of Ethnology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Ethnology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 670322, "name": "Southwest China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southwest_China?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 17009941, "title": "CHERILYN SARKISIAN \u2013 \u2018CHER\u2019 OR THE POSTMODERN PROMETHEUS: VOICING THE \u2018MARGINAL\u2019", "created_at": "2015-10-19T14:07:00.546-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/17009941/CHERILYN_SARKISIAN_CHER_OR_THE_POSTMODERN_PROMETHEUS_VOICING_THE_MARGINAL_?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_17009941", "summary": "This paper aims at showing how Cher\u2019s performance helps break barriers of official identities, celebrates difference, and ultimately voices the marginal.

Yet in 1904, during the eponymously named Younghusband Mission to Lhasa, officers of the British India government\u2019s punitive expedition would rip the covers from their intended roles and ideologically and materially make them into other things. The book-covers would become Tibetan art and material forms of colonial knowledge. They were separated from the texts they could no longer protect and would instead be bracketed to walls in imperial museums and colonial homes. \r\n\r\nThis paper will discuss the many transitions Tibetan book-covers have made in the hands of imperial powers (and also contemporary Tibetan artists). However, its main focus will fall on a group of book-covers that were transformed for a colonial officer\u2019s study. Made into a mantelpiece to hold and display other Tibetan things, the book-covers collectively offered a domestic imagining of the aesthetic and cultural sensibilities of a Himalayan Other. I will argue that the book-covers became the axis mundi, the sanctum sanctorum in a colonial officer\u2019s remaking of a powerful religious place in Tibet. This was a very different type of power place made in a Himalayan contact zone: one where the shrine for a Buddhist being was replaced by a colonial officer and his mantelpiece.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37305658, "asset_id": 11945089, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3751407, "first_name": "Emma", "last_name": "Martin", "domain_name": "manchester", "page_name": "EmmaMartin", "display_name": "Emma Martin", "profile_url": "https://manchester.academia.edu/EmmaMartin?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3751407/1358608/28352483/s65_emma.martin.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2905, "name": "Tibetan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tibetan_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2986, "name": "Material culture of religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_culture_of_religion?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8400, "name": "Cultural Encounters", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Encounters?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 -

L\u2019examen de ces formes d\u2019engagement et de reconnaissance dans des univers en ligne interroge directement la tension anthropologique entre game (le dispositif du jeu proprement dit) et playing (l\u2019appropriation du cadre du jeu inh\u00e9rent au fait m\u00eame de jouer).

This dissertation explores the interaction of these multiple views, and how they shape students\u2019 understanding of and attitudes toward science. Situated in a high school physics classroom, a curricular approach was designed and enacted to open a space in the classroom for the convergence of multiple discourses (or systems of cultural knowledge), and subsequently study how students navigate around them. \r\n\r\nEthnographic and critical inquiry revealed that when two or more discourses about similar natural events or objects (e.g., toss of a colorguard flag, human body) were directly juxtaposed in the classroom space, conceptual, affective, and ideological conflicts were generated for certain students. This was particularly so for students whose embedded experiences and social affiliations within certain discourse communities (e.g., sport clubs, church) led to their preferred ways of looking at the natural world from one particular discourse, and consequently a negative stance toward alternative ways in other discourses.\r\n\r\nHowever, through appropriate pedagogical design and support, such juxtaposition also created opportunities for some students to hybridize different cultural understandings of the natural world as they navigated around multiple discourses. Informed by Bakhtin\u2019s notions of heteroglossia and voice appropriation, the characteristics of such hybridization were found to include: (a) being aware of heteroglossic differences in the use of language, (b) a dynamic shift in identification toward the dialogic other, (c) a juxtaposition of the other\u2019s voices in one\u2019s utterances, and (d) a momentary suppression of one\u2019s preferences, for strategic motives. Not only did hybridization provide a means for some students to construct conceptual knowledge across discourses, but it also helped them develop critical literacy in evaluating how various views and knowledge of the natural world are constructed by and through discourses.\r\n\r\nThe findings of this dissertation provide insights into hybridization as a crucial mechanism of learning, and provide an alternative but complementary lens for understanding how young people bridge discourses \u2013 not as a stable binary but as a dynamic and fluid in-between.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 6224031, "asset_id": 1018540, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 848821, "first_name": "Kok-Sing", "last_name": "Tang", "domain_name": "curtinedu", "page_name": "KokSingTang", "display_name": "Kok-Sing  Tang", "profile_url": "https://curtinedu.academia.edu/KokSingTang?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/848821/300818/16829595/s65_kok-sing.tang.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 94, "name": "Discourse Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Discourse_Analysis?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 933, "name": "New Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Media?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 934, "name": "Media and Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1002, "name": "Informal Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Informal_Learning?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1736, "name": "Science Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_Education?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7905, "name": "New literacy studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_literacy_studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 12850, "name": "Media Discourse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Discourse?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 21201, "name": "Multimodality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multimodality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 23791, "name": "Third Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Third_Space?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 2605583, "title": "Rethinking the Nature of Urban Environmental Politics:  Security, Subjectivity, and the Non-Human", "created_at": "2013-02-18T20:33:59.263-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2605583/Rethinking_the_Nature_of_Urban_Environmental_Politics_Security_Subjectivity_and_the_Non_Human?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_2605583", "summary": "The growing field of urban political ecology (UPE) has greatly advanced understandings of the socio-ecological transformations through which urban economies and environments are produced. However, this field has thus far failed to fully consider subjective (and subject-forming) dimensions of urban environmental struggle. I argue that this can be overcome through bringing urban political ecology into conversation with both post-structural political ecology and critical geopolitics. Bridging these literatures focuses attention on practices of socio-ecological exclusion and attachment through which environmental subjectivities are formed. This argument is drawn out through a case study of the politics of local economic development and conservation within the watershed of the Big Darby Creek near Columbus, Ohio. This struggle was driven by a preservationist movement that coalesced around a shared understanding of socio-ecological hybridity as a source of metaphysical insecurity. Hybridity appears here as a site of political and ethical struggle over social and ecological exclusions produced in the pursuit of security. This case study demonstrates a paradox of environmental politics: the non-human is at once a site of constituent possibilities for identity and subjectivity as well as forces which seek to foreclose this radical openness. Recognizing the paradoxical nature of environmental struggle allows for a more complex and nuanced account of the multifarious forces that shape the formation of environmental subjectivities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30616161, "asset_id": 2605583, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2837402, "first_name": "Kevin", "last_name": "Grove", "domain_name": "fiu", "page_name": "KevinGrove", "display_name": "Kevin Grove", "profile_url": "https://fiu.academia.edu/KevinGrove?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2837402/930242/1164858/s65_kevin.grove.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2064, "name": "Critical Geopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Geopolitics?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2431, "name": "Urban Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Politics?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2809, "name": "Conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conservation?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3126, "name": "Political Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Ecology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3770, "name": "Metabolism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Metabolism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 8211, "name": "Local Economic Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Local_Economic_Development?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 10346, "name": "Environmental Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Politics?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 15210, "name": "Territory (Political Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Territory_Political_Theory_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 20082, "name": "Urban Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Political_Economy?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 54659, "name": "Subjectivity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subjectivity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 102984, "name": "Urban Political Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Political_Ecology?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 1127205, "title": "\"Take it easy, you can\u2019t learn everything the first time you land\": knowledge, appropriation and redefinition of London by some South East Asian and Caribbean Diaspora Writers", "created_at": "2011-11-30T16:52:44.313-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1127205/_Take_it_easy_you_can_t_learn_everything_the_first_time_you_land_knowledge_appropriation_and_redefinition_of_London_by_some_South_East_Asian_and_Caribbean_Diaspora_Writers?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_1127205", "summary": "\"My paper addresses the concept of Diaspora of the South East Asian communities in London, and it is focused on both its central areas and its peripheries as they are portrayed in the literary and essayist texts of Indian, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani writers.

Human body is made of the same stuff of other bodies, and they constitute a common being, the flesh of the world. Merleau-Ponty sets out a path through flat ontology and posthumanism, opposing human perspective as a privileged one. His posthuman turn passes through the concepts of reversibility and divergence. Humans are made of the same stuff as non-humans, so they reverse into one another, but, on the other hand, they are not reduced to an undifferentiated entity, because of their divergence.

In the Winter Semester 2020/21, the discussion of Pnina Werbner's article on the dialectics of hybridity during a Research Area 6 meeting captivated the members' interest. What novel ideas does hybridity bring to different cultural environments, and how? Possible answers were that cultural shifts between the local and the global are involved, as well as encounters and reformulation of identities. The concept helps reflect on the interaction processes between identities and cultures by considering the emergence of new realities. The interdisciplinary and international conference \"Cultural Identities in a Global World: Reframing Cultural Hybridity,\" from 23 to 25 June, aimed to shed light on the dynamics and social practices engaging hybridity as a tool of cultural analysis and formation. The experimental format of the laboratory conference aimed to inspire a reformulation of this concept and to bind everyday reality with academic knowledge during the keynote lecture, the two workshops, the eight panels, and the final laboratory debate.

Documentary games are both game-specific (rules, levels, opponents,measurable progress, rewards, etc.), and are also strongly based onthe facts, playing educational and activist roles. They can be available throughbrowsers, similar to hypertext websites, but are often designed for stationary or mobile consoles. In terms of genres, a significant range can also be observed: platform games, like Never Alone (2014, E-Line Media), adventure games: Valiant Hearts: the Great War (2014: Ubisoft) or 1979 Revolution (2014, N-Fusion), strategic games: This War of Mine (2014, 11bit studios), RPG (educational mode\nin Assassin\u2019s Creed: Origins [2017] and Assassin\u2019s Creed: Odyssey  2018]), or even survival horror: Kholat (2015, IMGN.PRO). The titles I describe present different approach to factual sources: they add documentary footage as cutscenes (Never Alone), they build narration around real events and characters, and make the player\u2019s avatar a fictional character (1979 Revolution), they base the game mechanics on the logic of events in well-defined real circumstances (This War of Mine). Since the works based on a genre-specific hybrid strategy occupy an important place in today\u2019s audiovisual landscape, I think it would be worth further examining this \u201cincompatible\u201d area: a documentary, traditionally combined with truth and seriousness, and digital games, usually associated with fiction and entertainment.

While archaeologists have emphasized group ideologies and personal motivations that promote cultural mixing, the absence of analytical frameworks for modeling how such mixing unfolds in practice makes it difficult to reconcile philosophical debates about hybridity and related approaches. This article lays out such a framework, starting with an assumption that the problem of mixed material culture is structural at its core and thus requires a structural solution. Building on the conception of social structure promoted by sociologist William Sewell Jr., the proposed model considers the incorporation of novel forms at two different loci of agency-the object and the assemblage-and through their respective practices of production and consumption. The object-assemblage model is used, in turn, to explore a colonial encounter between the Native town of Joara and the Spanish garrison, Fort San Juan, from 1566 to 1568, uniquely allowing us to envision how native and settler participants engaged new ideas and resources to transform their material cultures. Surely one measure of a theory's success is the degree to which it becomes a challenge to write-oftentimes even to think-in related fields of inquiry without invoking its logic, terms, and rhetoric. Just as surely, though, success becomes saturation, then critique and repudiation. So it is today, especially in the archaeology of colonialism, with hybridity and its cognates: the hybrid, hybridization, and hybrid material culture. Hybridity exploded across anthropology's theoretical landscape in the 1990s as part of the postcolonial discourse, most strongly advocated in the work of literary and cultural theorists (e.g.,. These and other scholars positioned hybridity as a postcolonial counterpoint to earlier conceptions of intercultural mixing such as acculturation, syncretism, and creolization. Shortly afterward, archaeologists turned to hybrid-ity for their interpretations of blending in the material culture of colonial encounters and entanglements (e.g. Inevitably, in the freshet of archaeological journal articles, book chapters, and edited volumes that followed, much of the con-cept's original force and emphasis were lost, and most of the critiques that emerged in its home fields of literary and cultural studies were either neglected or ignored. Calls are sounding now for restraint-if not an outright moratorium-on its continued use (Pappa 2013; Silliman 2013, 2015). This article is not strictly speaking about hybridity, not in the postcolonial sense of those tactics used by the disempow-ered to subvert dominant ideologies through mockery, mimicry , and caricature. My aim, then, is neither to bury hybridity nor to praise it. The concern I wish to raise is rather more pedestrian and derives from an observation made by several commenters on recent debates over the nature of hybridity in archaeological discourse. To a person, these writers agree that-regardless of whether we think that hybridity and its various iterations remain useful for the study of material culture we must guard against treating it merely as a form of cultural fusion or mixing (Liebmann 2015:19-20; Pappa 2013:33; Silliman 2015:281). This is well and good, for if the concept has value to archaeology and to broader studies of material culture, we must insist on the specificity of its use. But the tone of this routine contrast between hybridity and mere fusion or mixture seems to suggest that the latter is comparatively straightforward and simple, requiring little further comment. It implies that we can shift with confidence to the interpretive pastures of power and subversion because the middle-range fields of practice, where cultural mixing actually occurs, are sufficiently well understood. On the contrary, I suggest that an absence of analytical approaches for understanding how such mixing occurs in practice makes it difficult to reconcile or push beyond the abstract debates about hybridity and related ideas. This paper offers such an approach, drawing on conceptions of social structure and structural transformation (or events) developed by sociologist and cultural historian William Sewell Jr. (1992, 1996, 2005). Here I consider cultural mixing (which we can define as the incorporation of new material culture) at two distinct but interrelated loci of agency, the object and the assemblage , and through their respective but likewise interrelated practices of production and consumption. Finally, I use this approach to explicate the material consequences of an intercultural colonial encounter that took place at the Berry site (31BK22), located in what is now western North Carolina,", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64706438, "asset_id": 44318650, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8186810, "first_name": "Robin", "last_name": "Beck", "domain_name": "umich", "page_name": "RobinBeck", "display_name": "Robin  Beck", "profile_url": "https://umich.academia.edu/RobinBeck?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8186810/2819435/3290316/s65_robin.beck.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5346, "name": "Archaeological Method & Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Method_and_Theory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13649, "name": "North American archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/North_American_archaeology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 16226, "name": "Materiality (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Materiality_Anthropology_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 18088, "name": "Southeastern Archaeology (Archaeology in North America)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeastern_Archaeology_Archaeology_in_North_America_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 23547, "name": "Assemblage Theory - Manuel De Landa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Assemblage_Theory_-_Manuel_De_Landa?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 37351, "name": "Spanish Colonial Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spanish_Colonial_Archaeology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 55427, "name": "Social Structure", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Structure?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 79465, "name": "Materiality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Materiality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 79654, "name": "Contact Period Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contact_Period_Archaeology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 115535, "name": "Assemblage Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Assemblage_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 538424, "name": "Archaeology of Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_Colonialism?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 43212267, "title": "Hybridity of Indonesian Buddhism", "created_at": "2020-05-31T06:39:16.532-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43212267/Hybridity_of_Indonesian_Buddhism?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_43212267", "summary": "The paper deals with the hybrid forms of religion as the product of transnational networks, mainly run by the Thai Dhammayutta missionaries (TDMs) in this case study.

But much of the focus still remains on attempts of large companies to reduce social harm along their supply chains rather than creating social good. At the same time, research investigating the role of NGOs in supply chains or humanitarian logistics often emphasizes temporary initiatives and overlooks long-term viability. This conceptual paper seeks to expand the playing field by looking at how social enterprises manage their supply chains to generate social benefit while maintaining or improving their financial viability in the long term. Our contribution is to consider those socially motivated organizations that lie on the continuum between purely social and purely commercial enterprises. We consider how these organizations manage their supply chains for social impact and define this area as social impact supply chain management (SISCM). In this work, we view these organizations and managerial issues through the lens of institutional complexity, that is, the presence of multiple and possibly conflicting institutional logics in the focal organization. We propose that, for these organizations, supply chain strategy, stakeholder identification and engagement, and relationship management might differentiate SISCM from traditional supply chain management. And as a result, we offer future research directions that might add clarity to effective SISCM.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62222462, "asset_id": 42091774, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35308514, "first_name": "Madeleine", "last_name": "Pullman", "domain_name": "pdx", "page_name": "MelliePullman", "display_name": "Madeleine E .

Whereas media historians generally focus on historical changes by maintaining a diachronic perspective on how media technologies and practices develop over time, media archaeologists commonly adopt a synchronic perspective in (re)constructing parallel or alternative histories. This chapter aims to explore and propose a third approach to media historiography, which departs from the notion of \u201chybridity\u201d: the intermingling and co-existence of old and new media technologies, user practices, and discourses as evolving in an ongoing process. Building on some of the empirical and conceptual results of my research on the home movie as a twentieth-century family memory practice, I develop the argument that a \u201chybrid media historiography\u201d enables one to grasp the complex interrelations and dynamics between media technologies, user practices, and discourses in more precise and comprehensive ways by maintaining both a diachronic and synchronic perspective in studying media transitions. By looking specifically at how the transition from amateur film to home video gradually constituted a new home movie dispositif in the 1970s and 1980s, I will underline the heuristic potential of

A couple of important animal configurations will be identified in Mutsaers\u2019s work through the analysis of animal discursive devices and metamorphoses in La Fontaine. In this respect, La Fontaine\u2019s fable \u2018La Chatte m\u00e9tamorphos\u00e9e en femme\u2019 (\u2018The cat metamorphosed into a woman\u2019) (1688-1693) will be compared with Mutsaers\u2019s novel Koetsier Herfst (2008). The literary-philosophical frameworks of metamorphosis and hybridity as well as the becoming-animal motif, drawn from research in the Cultural and Literary Animal Studies (CLAS), will prove useful to show how animal aspects in Mutsaers and La Fontaine relate to each other and correlate with different political discourses about the animal. The analysed creative and discursive human-animal patterns in Mutsaers\u2019s and La Fontaine\u2019s texts set out significant social-philosophical reversals of perspective about the animal-human bond and shed new light on Mutsaers\u2019s artistic practice.

Striker and Do\u011fan Kuban in the nineteen sixties and seventies revealed that the Kalenderhane Mosque was part of the monastic complex of the Virgin Kyriotissa. The vita cycle of Saint Francis and some other finds suggest that the church was used as a Catholic Church during the Latin occupation. The mysterious cycle of Saint Francis has attracted scholarly attention since its discovery. Scholarship mainly focuses on four aspects of the cycle: establishing its historical setting, patronage and dating; identifying the scenes in the cycle and their links to contemporary and later mural and panel paintings and cycles of Saint Francis; stylistic associations of the cycle with other works of art and, in particular, with a group of thirteenth-century Crusader manuscripts; and, lastly, the choice of Byzantine vita format for the fresco cycle.\nThe ensemble of various Eastern and Western components in the program is a less discussed and researched aspect of the cycle. It is commonly considered to reflect the mid-thirteenth century climate of the ongoing negotiations for the union of the Greek Orthodox Church and Latin Catholic Church. The quite unusual importance attributed to Greek Church Fathers, depicted twice the size of the central figure of Francis and in a prominent location framing the cycle, is generally interpreted as a reference to the identification of the common origins of the Latin Church and Greek Church and the parallels between Franciscan spirituality and Byzantine monasticism. \nHowever, in this paper, I will argue that the joint presence of Western and Eastern elements and some overlooked particularities of its iconographic program may also lead to a different reading. This new interpretation of the Saint Francis cycle goes far beyond the attempt of the mendicant order to legitimize the sainthood of their recently canonized founder and requires reconsideration of its context against the backdrop of the ongoing negotiations of power and ideology in the post-Crusades Mediterranean.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52165675, "asset_id": 31854326, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14748781, "first_name": "Sebnem", "last_name": "Donbekci", "domain_name": "ku", "page_name": "SebnemDonbekci", "display_name": "Sebnem Donbekci", "profile_url": "https://ku.academia.edu/SebnemDonbekci?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14748781/4018145/23135584/s65_sebnem.donbekci.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42180, "name": "Constantinople", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Constantinople?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 125431, "name": "Byzantine art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Byzantine_art?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 127835, "name": "Crusader Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Crusader_Art?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 452540, "name": "Art of the Mendicant Orders", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_of_the_Mendicant_Orders?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 31782648, "title": "Imperial hybridity in the early Christian \u2018symbolic eunuch\u2019 reading of Matt. 19:12", "created_at": "2017-03-09T00:25:46.876-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31782648/Imperial_hybridity_in_the_early_Christian_symbolic_eunuch_reading_of_Matt_19_12?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_31782648", "summary": "This is a seminar paper for a course on theoretical approaches to early Christian studies. In the course, we examined the role of theory and how it can be used to illuminate our understandings of early Christianity, and we read various theories and examples of how scholars have applied these theories to early Christian studies. For our seminar papers, we were asked to apply a theory to an aspect of early Christianity. I apply Homi Bhabha's postcolonial theory to the emergence and eventual dominance in early Christianity of a particular interpretation of the figure of the eunuch in Matthew 19:12, namely 'eunuch' as a metaphor for 'celibate.' I argue that we can identify two cases of 'imperial hybridity' undertaken by early proponents of Christian celibacy: the hybridizing of the symbol of the eunuch in the text and in reality, and the mimicry and eventual hybrid takeover of Roman ideals of masculinity. My argument is exploratory and speculative, but looking at this history through this theoretical perspective can help illuminate some aspects of the history that would perhaps not otherwise be apparent. It can help us focus on the conditions of possibility of various possible interpretations of the verse in the context of early Christianity in the Roman empire. It can also highlight the ways that real eunuchs and gender/sexual minorities are scapegoated in battles over interpretation, gender, sex, and power. Finally, it can help us see that insofar as the dominant interpretation of the verse and the dominant Christian marginalization of gender/sexual minorities are based on patterns resembling imperial hybridity, they retain some instability and some vulnerability to potential disruption.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52084443, "asset_id": 31782648, "asset_type": "Work",

Networks, festivities, practices and habits of Bangladeshis in Lavapi\u00e9s are generally oriented towards Bangladesh. Nevertheless, Bangladeshis dub their restaurants and other businesses \" Indian \" as part of an ethnic marketing strategy that uses national/identitarian descriptions as a resource. This self-denomination is explained through historic and cultural links to India, though the practice also evolved within the framework of colonial relations to Britain. As will be shown, the restaurant and food business in which Bangladeshis in Lavapi\u00e9s engage emerged over centuries of cultural criss-crossings between Europe and the Indian subcontinent, only more recently being introduced to Spain. These translocal dynamics in the historic and contemporary dimensions of migrants' experiences result in the possibility of highly contextual activations of self-descriptions and self-representations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43071087, "asset_id": 22453896, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9793784, "first_name":

BBC presenter Clare Balding immediately linked Shiwen to doping. If \u2018trolling\u2019 online is the deliberate upsetting of audiences to trigger debate and reflection, was Balding trolling? Her comments triggered trajectories of affective engagement across social and mainstream media, in Britain and internationally, which fed back into BBC coverage. We trace the \u2018event arc\u2019 of controversy, finding complex tensions between broadcasters, journalists, celebrities and Twitter users as they compete to control the event\u2019s framing. Continued controversy and attention \u2013 \u2018remediated trolling\u2019 \u2013 benefited these secondary actors.

Und doch sind die \u00c4quivalenzen zum Western vielf\u00e4ltig.\r\nAusgehend von drei zentralen Elementen des Western - Outlaw, Landschaft, Standardsituationen - werden in dem Band transnationale Variationen des Western bis zu neueren Hybridfilmen untersucht.

examines some of the circumstances surrounding the creation of the hybrid intercultural music project, Ultimate Cows. A concert was performed at the Encounters: India festival in Brisbane in 2013, and featured the results of a collaboration between master percussionists Guru Kaaraikudi Mani and Ghatam Vaidyanathan Suresh from the South Indian Carnatic tradition, and musicians including violinist John Rodgers, percussionist Tunji Beier, and myself, a guitarist, from the Brisbane jazz and new music scene. The ways in which the intercultural work was conceptualised, developed, and received are explored with reference to the composition and collaborative process. The discussion reveals aspects of the ways in which musicians relate to culture, and the ways that culture is performed in intercultural hybrid work. In line with the critical theory around hybridity, Ultimate Cows is proposed as symptomatic of hybridity\u2019s pervasiveness, a natural consequence of musicians\u2019 desire to extend their practice through interactions with the musical Others that they encounter. The discussion of power and perspective is acknowledged as central to the discussion of hybrid works, and the various ways that difference is made manifest with reference to the musical work No Can Do. The compositional development of that work is shown to simultaneously explore and reconcile archetypal musical structures from Carnatic and jazz musics, and explore some of the inherent problems that are consequently implied for the works\u2019 reception. In the process it uncovers differences in musical approach, perception, and the notion of acquired cultural archetypes, which affect the way that musicians orient themselves to the music in performance.

La premi\u00e8re explique que la girafe est le fruit d\u2019une hybridation, parfois en deux g\u00e9n\u00e9rations, entre le chameau, le b\u0153uf et l\u2019hy\u00e8ne. Cette l\u00e9gende a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s probablement influenc\u00e9e par la zoologie grecque antique, notamment par Timoth\u00e9e de Gaza. Cette hybridit\u00e9 suppos\u00e9e a longtemps divis\u00e9 les juristes quant au statut alimentaire de la viande de cet animal selon l\u2019islam. Hybride de l\u2019hy\u00e8ne, la girafe est impure\u00a0; animal ruminant ressemblant au b\u00e9tail, sa viande est alors pure. Une autre l\u00e9gende, relative aux circonstances de la naissance dangereuse des girafons que leurs m\u00e8res cherchent \u00e0 tuer d\u00e8s la fin de la parturition, n\u2019est cependant pas venue contredire la l\u00e9gende de l\u2019hybridit\u00e9. L\u2019observation de naissances de girafes en captivit\u00e9 dans les m\u00e9nageries du\u00a0 Caire n\u2019est pas parvenue non plus \u00e0 affaiblir l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se de l\u2019hybridit\u00e9, qui a eu une longue post\u00e9rit\u00e9 dans les livres des merveilles, encyclop\u00e9dies et trait\u00e9s g\u00e9ographiques jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque ottomane.\r\n\r\nTwo legends concerning the hybrid nature and the birth of giraffes are frequently cited in Arabic sources. The first legend explains that the giraffe is a hybrid of the camel, the ox and the hyena, sometimes appearing after two generations. This legend was probably influenced by Ancient Greek zoology, especially that of Timotheus of Gaza. Because of the supposedly hybrid nature of the camel, its alimentary status under Islamic dietary laws was a subject of long debate amongst religious scholars. As the hybrid off-spring of a hyena, the giraffe would be unclean; as the off-spring of a ruminant such as cattle, its flesh would be pure and fit to be eaten.

In particular, the persistence of identification with the county of origin post-migration offers new insights on the construction and maintenance of identity within the Irish diaspora. Drawing on my PhD research on discourses of authenticity and identity among the Irish in England, this article investigates the ways in which county identity is invoked both by Irish migrants and those of Irish descent. It illustrates how the county is used as a rhetorical tool to situate the speaker within discourses of belonging and authenticity, but how this may also act as a constraint on the articulation of a collective, diasporic identity. It argues for a greater research focus on translocalism within the context of changing Ireland\u2013diaspora relations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 41581285, "asset_id": 3844714,

"work_1054442", "summary": "This article explores the methodological implications of actor-network theory for social research. Pointing to an increasing awareness of ANT in sociological discourse, but assuming that it is more widely known than well understood, the article outlines some of the key features of ANT as an approach to social life, before addressing the tricky question of how these ideas translate into methodological practice. The possibilities of the approach are illustrated by reference to my own ANT-inspired historical research on the socio-material history of dairy milk in the UK, which is used as a point of reference and an example throughout. Particular attention is given to the practical method deployed in the milk study, namely documentary historiography, leading to a critical exploration of the use of ANT in the analysis of historical texts. This involves considering the nature of the relationship between texts and lived practices, and drawing out how ANT offers a distinctive way of seeing texts which challenges the standard ethnographic view of texts and fundamentally transforms the issue. Given that documentary historiography is not a method strongly associated with actor-network theory because it raises considerable methodological dilemmas, this provides one particular account of how such dilemmas can be managed or overcome. Social researchers interested in the potential of actor-network theory should be able to draw upon this in exploring the possibilities of the approach for their own work. \r\n\r\nKeywords\r\n\r\nActor-network theory; Methodology; Hybrids; Heterogeneity; Nonhuman Agency; Relational Ontology; Texts; Practices; Historiography.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 10224883, "asset_id": 1054442, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 42992, "first_name": "Richie", "last_name": "Nimmo", "domain_name": "manchester", "page_name": "RichieNimmo", "display_name": "Richie  Nimmo", "profile_url": "https://manchester.academia.edu/RichieNimmo?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/42992/13888/15580841/s65_richie.nimmo.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 805, "name": "Ontology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ontology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1230, "name": "Social Research Methods and Methodology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Research_Methods_and_Methodology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3136, "name": "Qualitative methodology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qualitative_methodology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11534, "name": "Material Agency", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Agency?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 22468, "name": "Actor-Network-Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Actor-Network-Theory?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 68797339, "title": "Cultivating Young Learners' Early Literacy through Hybrid Storytelling", "created_at": "2022-01-20T02:26:14.998-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/68797339/Cultivating_Young_Learners_Early_Literacy_through_Hybrid_Storytelling?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_68797339", "summary": "Using storytelling in English Language Learning (ELL) classrooms during early literacy stages represents an effective learning opportunity (Mastellotto, 2021).

Children's picture stories stimulate the learners through hybrid socio-semiotic contexts that include three dimensions of meaning: ideational, interpersonal, and textual metafunctions (Halliday, 1978). This study will explore children's picture stories as a hybrid tool for developing young learners' linguistic and visual literacies.

peace and conflict studies on the so-called 'local turn' in peacebuilding where the role of local actors, their agency and their relationship to international actors is strongly emphasised. Still, even with widespread academic optimism about the emancipatory potential of the local, strong caveats of 'not romanticising the local' are constantly repeated. By looking at the Balkan countries and their traditional practices of peacebuilding, this article asks whether the local has the potential to be the empowering agent or if such expectations are much too ambitious, both at the academic and policy level. Drawing on the research findings which show the persistence of coercive and noncoercive local peacebuilding practices, the article poses the Paris question once again: should liberal peacebuilding be saved, and if so, where are the locals in this rescue attempt?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66102874, "asset_id": 45614834, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9644780, "first_name": "Nemanja", "last_name": "D\u017euverovi\u0107", "domain_name": "bg", "page_name": "NemanjaD\u017euverovi\u0107", "display_name": "Nemanja D\u017euverovi\u0107", "profile_url": "https://bg.academia.edu/NemanjaD%C5%BEuverovi%C4%87?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9644780/3035444/32305318/s65_nemanja.d_uverovi_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 977, "name": "Development Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3337, "name": "Balkan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Balkan_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3849, "name": "Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4222, "name": "Hybrid Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybrid_Systems?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 8536, "name": "Hybridization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridization?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13614, "name": "Conflict Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 15290, "name": "Ottoman Balkans", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ottoman_Balkans?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 24048, "name": "Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 45559, "name": "Peace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 45578, "name": "Peacebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peacebuilding?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 49250, "name": "Balkans", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Balkans?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 44483977, "title": "Tu ubicaci\u00f3n.

Theoretically, it takes shape within a growing body of literature on cosmopolitanism that provides new insights into understanding migration and mobilities. Empirically, it is situated within the context of a growing trend of Chinese migration to New Zealand, a country experiencing increasing ethnic diversity. Employing the concept of \"rooted cosmopolitanism,\" the paper explores how different degrees of a sense of rootedness interrelate with the strength of cosmopolitan openness to cultural others, as displayed in daily interactions. It demonstrates that rootedness and cosmopolitan openness are not mutually exclusive, but simultaneously coexist and even mutually strengthen each other. It argues that the process of becoming a rooted cosmopolitan is not straightforward but demands constant work to strategically negotiate the interacting dynamics between openness and its seeming counter-discourse-rootedness.

La racine grecque phantasia dont la traduction fran\u00e7aise est la lumi\u00e8re s\u2019est, elle, d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e dans le sens de fantaisie, fantasme. \u00ab La diff\u00e9rence phantasia / imaginatio, dont t\u00e9moignent les difficult\u00e9s que les Latins ont \u00e9prouv\u00e9es \u00e0 traduire le grec, est celle entre la force cr\u00e9atrice des apparitions et la facult\u00e9 reproductive des images, chacun des termes pouvant lui-m\u00eame \u00eatre travaill\u00e9 du dedans par cette tension et les jugements de valeur qui s\u2019y attachent.... Cette m\u00eame tension d\u00e9termine la place de l\u2019imagination dans le jeu des facult\u00e9s et des modalit\u00e9s d\u2019\u00eatre au monde. Est-ce une facult\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019exercice des autres facult\u00e9s, entre passivit\u00e9 et activit\u00e9, ou, comme dit Pascal, une ma\u00eetresse d\u2019erreur et de fausset\u00e9 ?\u00bb.\nLe r\u00eave, selon ce m\u00eame Vocabulaire Europ\u00e9en des Philosophies a un statut particulier en fran\u00e7ais. En effet, si en anglais, allemand ou italien, il n\u2019y a qu\u2019un seul mot pour dire le r\u00eave, le fran\u00e7ais a forg\u00e9 2 termes : \u00ab le songe qui d\u00e9rive du latin somnium et le r\u00eave qui d\u00e9rive de rabies, la rage. Le d\u00e9lire se croise avec l\u2019\u00e9vasion dans l\u2019imaginaire \u00e0 moins qu\u2019on ait affaire \u00e0 une superposition des deux. A c\u00f4t\u00e9 de \u00ab l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des r\u00eaves \u00bb on a \u00ab la cl\u00e9 des songes \u00bb ; cette dualit\u00e9 singuli\u00e8re \u00e0 son histoire. Songer a ses lettres de noblesse. Ses valeurs se situent dans un cadre de grande libert\u00e9 s\u00e9mantique. Le mot scille par jeu d\u2019un va-et-vient entre la rigueur de la pens\u00e9e dirig\u00e9e et le vague de l\u2019imaginaire. L\u2019\u00e9volution de la langue lui a fait occuper souverainement le terrain, se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant d\u2019une part \u00e0 l\u2019op\u00e9ration rationnelle de penser, du latin pensare, peser qui rattache l\u2019activit\u00e9 r\u00e9flexive \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019une \u00e9valuation et d\u2019une appr\u00e9ciation qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas dans songer et \u00e9voquant d\u2019autre part le monde oppos\u00e9 des exp\u00e9riences oniriques.

Previous scholars have interpreted EGG Ware as the product of indigenous potters who fired ceramics in kilns and learned how to make glazed vessels through direct instruction from Iberian ceramicists. We argue that the production of EGG Ware entailed a more complex process of technological incorporation and innovation. SEM microstructural analysis of 44 archaeological samples suggests that these ceramics were originally fired under highly variable conditions. Parallel analysis of five samples of lead-glazed ceramics produced in open firings by Peruvian artisans in the 1980's reveals consistent firing beyond their clays' maturation temperatures. Based on these results and analysis of whole EGG Ware vessels from museum collections, we suggest that at least some of our EGG Ware samples were produced in open firings. In turn, we argue that EGG Ware reflects the creativity of native potters who adapted indigenous firing technologies and experimented with different parameters in the process of forging a new decorative tradition.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52966223, "asset_id": 32816014, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 267025, "first_name": "Parker", "last_name": "VanValkenburgh", "domain_name": "brown", "page_name": "ParkerVanValkenburgh", "display_name": "Parker VanValkenburgh", "profile_url": "https://brown.academia.edu/ParkerVanValkenburgh?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/267025/55842/21791910/s65_parker.vanvalkenburgh.jpg"}, {"id": 7768983, "first_name": "Sarah", "last_name": "Kelloway", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "SarahKelloway", "display_name": "Sarah J Kelloway", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/SarahKelloway?f_ri=4138", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1789, "name": "Andean Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Andean_Archaeology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10072, "name": "Technology transfer", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Technology_transfer?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10655, "name": "Scanning Electron Microscopy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Scanning_Electron_Microscopy?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 19722, "name": "Andean Prehistory (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Andean_Prehistory_Archaeology_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 24827, "name": "Ceramics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramics_Archaeology_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 62465, "name": "Andean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Andean_History?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 107363, "name": "Archaeometry, archaeological science, ceramics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeometry_archaeological_science_ceramics?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 985817, "name": "Andean Peru", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Andean_Peru?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 30137950, "title": "Rap Music's Double-Voiced Discourse: A Crossroads for Interracial Communication", "created_at": "2016-11-28T09:27:18.021-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30137950/Rap_Musics_Double_Voiced_Discourse_A_Crossroads_for_Interracial_Communication?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_30137950", "summary": "This essay grew out of a Masters thesisat California State University-Hayward: \"Droppin' Science: Rap Music's Postmodern Critique.\" ABSTRACT: I focus here on the public discourse of rap music as an \"electronically mediated\" forum which is being used by participants in order to redefine their ethnicity and relationship to \"mainstream\" culture.

These were the ideological basis on which international interveners used to cohere their policy frameworks towards the Global South. Pragmatic approaches posit that the key to successful post-conflict transition lies in local \u2013 non-western, non-universalist \u2013 epistemologies and that empowering this pool of idiosyncratic insider understandings requires the deconstruction of modern liberal-universalist forms of knowing.

These analytical tools define Turkish-German migrant cinema as a \u2018cinema of duty\u2019, which creates a stereotypical image of the Turk carrying a \u2018burden of representation\u2019, and seek to replace these narratives with those that ostensibly liberate Turkish Germans from this burden by celebrating instead the \u2018pleasures of hybridity\u2019. The author's intention in this article is to offer a more developed reading of these previously denigrated stereotypes and to argue that in their afterlives stereotypes of the guest worker represent much more than simple arrested images. All of this is related to a reading of S\u00fclbiye G\u00fcnar's 2002 film Karamuk, which has been ironically examined as one of the rare Turkish-German films to move away from the outdated stereotype of the Turkish guest worker. However, this article sets out to argue contrarily that the film stages the pliancy of the stereotype by stripping it from the Turk in order to observe its subtle reappearance in the unsuspecting German, and thus reveals novel performances of stereotypes that complicate categories of ethnicity and identity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40870516, "asset_id": 10276132, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 734286, "first_name": "Bar\u0131\u015f", "last_name": "K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7bay", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "Bar\u0131\u015fK\u0131l\u0131\u00e7bay", "display_name": "Bar\u0131\u015f K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7bay", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/Bar%C4%B1%C5%9FK%C4%B1l%C4%B1%C3%A7bay?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/734286/250774/72766001/s65_bar_.k_l_bay.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19258, "name": "Cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cinema?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 44069, "name": "Turkish-German Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Turkish-German_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 190754, "name": "Turkish-German Cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Turkish-German_Cinema?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 7950323, "title": "\"Everything will be revised\": Anxious Landscapes and Hybrid Structures in the work of Ciaran Carson", "created_at": "2014-08-12T06:51:35.890-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7950323/_Everything_will_be_revised_Anxious_Landscapes_and_Hybrid_Structures_in_the_work_of_Ciaran_Carson?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_7950323", "summary": "Working with definitions of hybridity found in cultural criticism this paper's aim is to suggest that the hybrid nature of Carson's text is a reflection not only of his myriad influences and interests - from Williams and Benjamin to Irish history and pop culture - but also of the hybrid nature of the poet's interior and exterior world.

The framework focuses on the concepts of mixture strategies\u2014perceptible processes of interaction and manipulation of styles, genres, and other identity markers. Mixture strategies are recurrent treatments of disparate musical identities in hybrid music, and not only do they define what the materials are, they more fully explore how these entities are put together. There are four distinct mixture strategies\u2014clash, coexistence, distortion, and trajectory\u2014and each have peculiar characteristics and significations contingent on their use structurally and contextually.\r\n\r\nIn the article I define and exemplify each of the four mixture strategies in composers from, or related to, the post-1960s polystylistic concert music such as Alfred Schnittke, George Rochberg, Sofia Gubaidulina, and Peter Maxwell Davies. In these works, hybridity itself is foregrounded, and articulates the musical discourse as much, and oftentimes more so, than other musical parameters. Thus, this repertory proves helpful to demonstrate a general framework that can, and should, be applicable to other hybrid repertories. As I discuss the mixture strategies, I will debate the potential interpretive tropes for each. Then, I apply these ideas in interpreting the entire second movement of Schnittke\u2019s Concerto Grosso no. 1, a work that explores all four mixture strategies. The second movement is then contextualized within the entire concerto.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 83459814, "asset_id": 75834028, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 83459813, "asset_id": 75834028, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5658112, "first_name": "Bruno", "last_name": "Alcalde", "domain_name": "sc", "page_name": "BrunoAlcalde", "display_name": "Bruno Alcalde", "profile_url": "https://sc.academia.edu/BrunoAlcalde?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5658112/21161277/20621234/s65_bruno.alcalde.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3125, "name": "Genre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genre?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28060, "name": "Hybridity in Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity_in_Music?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 163928, "name": "Musical Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Musical_Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 588878, "name": "Musical Style", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Musical_Style?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 591307, "name": "Polystylism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Polystylism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1036417, "name": "Hybridity and Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity_and_Music?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1536751, "name": "Musical Genre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Musical_Genre?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 54904341, "title": "Teaching Novice Teachers to Enhance Learning in the Hybrid University", "created_at": "2021-10-02T12:58:59.606-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/54904341/Teaching_Novice_Teachers_to_Enhance_Learning_in_the_Hybrid_University?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_54904341", "summary": "Hybrid learning spaces are often associated with \u2018blended\u2019 education and defined by the presence of a mediating technology. In this paper, we shift the focus from tech-nology to practice in the search for a relationist perspective that understands hybrid space  as  emerging  from  a  sociomaterial  assemblage.  In  this  perspective,  learning  and  teaching  involve  blurred  boundaries  and  spatiotemporal  configurations  in  a  context of radical uncertainty. The paper presents a qualitative study of an ongoing project  called  Teknosofikum,  a  course/concept  for  the  professional  development  of  novice higher-education teachers in Denmark. The project addresses the complexity of  distributed  learning  in  (post-)pandemic  hybrid  spaces  and  times.  It  aims  at  gen-erating imaginative pedagogies through the use of technology while also nurturing ontological aspects of the teaching profession. The paper presents and discusses data from  the  first  iteration,  which  included  co-designed  processes  of  prototype  content  development and a mini-trial with seven course participants. Two key findings about teacher  professional  development  emerge  from  the  study.  The  first  is  the  need  to  focus on multiple and situated teaching activities, providing a bridge between learn-ing theories and educational practices. The second is the importance of knowing-in-practice, rather than acquiring knowledge, to create space for imagination in teach-ing with technologies and face up to the dynamic evolution of higher education.

We focus on two life-stages of \u2018return\u2019 for this second generation: as young children brought to Greece on holidays or sent back for longer periods, and as young adults exercising an independent \u2018return\u2019 migration. We draw both on literature and on our own field interviews with 50 first- and second-generation Greek-Germans. We find the practise of sending young children back to Greece to have been surprisingly widespread yet little documented. Adult relocation to the parental homeland takes place for five reasons: (i) a \u2018search for self\u2019; (ii) attraction of the Greek way of life; (iii) the actualisation of the \u2018family narrative of return\u2019 by the second, rather than the first, generation; (iv) life-stage events such as going to university or marrying a Greek; (v) escape from a traumatic event or oppressive family situation. Yet the return often brings difficulties, disillusionment, identity reappraisal, and a re-ev...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 69461911, "asset_id": 51989290, "asset_type": "Work",

This article first describes the ways in which hip-hop culture has been adopted and adapted in Guadeloupe. Then, it provides an in-depth analysis of the rap song Awogan released in 2001 by the group Gwada Nostra. Challenging the binary colonial thinking, this song opens a \u201cthird space\u201d (Bhabha 1994) that engenders new forms of cultural meaning. Drawing from local art forms and addressing social and political issues, this song illustrates how hip-hop has enabled the construction of hybrid narratives reflective of the French postcolonial power relations. Finally, this article examines how the circulation of hip-hop has given Guadeloupean rappers an opportunity to express their difference through a political use of racial self-identification in a country marked by colour-blind assimilation politics.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66075512, "asset_id": 44492560, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 44703627, "first_name": "Florabelle", "last_name": "Spielmann", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "FlorabelleSpielmann", "display_name": "Florabelle Spielmann", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/FlorabelleSpielmann?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/44703627/15817102/37355692/s65_florabelle.spielmann.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 671, "name": "Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13995, "name": "Postcolonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Theory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14904, "name": "Hip-Hop/Rap", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hip-Hop_Rap?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 97500, "name": "Guadeloupe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Guadeloupe?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 626410, "name": "Modernity/coloniality/decoloniality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modernity_coloniality_decoloniality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1196959, "name": "Globalisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalisation?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 41879742, "title": "A Memory of Nature: Ecotourism on Panama's Barro Colorado Island", "created_at": "2020-02-06T02:58:50.030-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41879742/A_Memory_of_Nature_Ecotourism_on_Panamas_Barro_Colorado_Island?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_41879742", "summary": " In this paper, I draw on a combination of ethnographic and historical research to consider some of the paradoxes and contradictions associated with Barro Colorado Island.

It has what many regard as Panama\u2019s best-preserved tropical moist forest, with that country\u2019s largest trees and an extraordinary biodiversity. These features, together with ease of access, have long drawn both scientists and tourists to the island. However, Barro Colorado is only an island thanks to the fact that between 1910 and 1913, US engineers dammed the Chagres River Valley to create the Gat\u00fan Lake. Both above and beneath the Gat\u00fan\u2019s emerald green waters one finds a history of colonialism that may be erased by the current emphasis on Barro Colorado\u2019s remarkable forest.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63737659, "asset_id": 41879742, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 44435889, "first_name": "Nils", "last_name": "Lindahl Elliot", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "NilsLindahlElliot", "display_name": "Nils Lindahl Elliot", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/NilsLindahlElliot?f_ri=4138", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 263, "name": "Cultural Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Geography?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2068, "name": "Ecotourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecotourism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3722, "name": "Environmental History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 18609, "name": "Cultural Historical Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Historical_Geography?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 189827, "name": "Hybrid Geographies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybrid_Geographies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1524571, "name": "Barro Colorado Island", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Barro_Colorado_Island?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 32017168, "title": "Response mode: taking everything and the genre", "created_at": "2017-03-23T20:26:43.158-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32017168/Response_mode_taking_everything_and_the_genre?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_32017168", "summary": "Response mode: taking everything and the genre Abstract: This hybrid paper of creative and critical writing reflects on my explorations of poetry. I write in what I call 'response mode', which is a group of behaviours, beginning with impersonation, and also open to understandings gained from other art forms. After studying the style and techniques of other poets, I move towards a mid-point between another poet's voice and my own, effectively, a new, hybrid voice. The engagement with literary ancestors enables evolution towards an expression that is more fully my own. Stealing the designations of genre ensures a continued experiment. The challenges and variety of voicings made possible by prose poetry and haibun are important. The haibun influences other new hybrid forms, which encompass found poetry and appropriate language in a way which is redolent of the times. We take from exhibitions, songs, film, poems, conversation. Poets eavesdrop; I do it on the bus. If there is stealing, it is on a spectrum, which includes intertext. My poems draw from Gerard Manley Hopkins, Yunna Moritz and Alan Loney, and from sculptor Cori Beardsley, who suggest to me fresh possibilities.

The play\u2019s title, \u201cThe Recognition of Shakuntala,\u201d has been understood to refer to the literal recognition of Shakuntala by her husband Duhsanta who has forgotten her due to a curse by the short-tempered sage Durvasa.

After her love marriage to Duhsanta, is Shakuntala prevented from becoming the Queen because she is a person of mixed descent, a free-spirited lover, and a girl brought up in a forest hermitage? Is Abhijnanashakuntalam a discreet play about a person of hybrid identity born of an inter-caste union whose transgressive otherness is not accepted in the caste-coded, patriarchal \u201cIndian\u201d society of 5th century CE?

Thus, my analysis explicitly challenges the tendencies in previous Strindberg scholarship to reduce the text to its Nietzscheanism, and to play down the archipelago setting as a reference to the author\u2019s native landscape. As I will show, assumptions of this kind not only underestimate the radicalism of Strindberg\u2019s language, but also neglect the acute tension created by the hybrid setting of \"I havsbandet\", which brings the novel in line with the highly experimental texts of the twentieth century. Eventually, my approach explores the similarities and differences of scientific and poetic language as well as male and female language and highlights the literary and poetical strategies Strindberg\u2019s text uses in order to create a progressive order of (well-constructed) knowledge. Consequently, I would like to suggest that the Swedish archipelago novel not only precedes contemporary theories of civilization and colonization, but also foreshadows seminal mid-twentieth-century theories of space and radical boundary-crossing.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56648041, "asset_id": 36708121, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 79514021, "first_name": "Irina", "last_name": "Hron", "domain_name": "ku-dk", "page_name": "IrinaHron", "display_name": "Irina Hron", "profile_url": "https://ku-dk.academia.edu/IrinaHron?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/79514021/19387997/76644097/s65_irina.hron.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11795, "name": "Swedish Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Swedish_Literature?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 37548, "name": "20th Century Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/20th_Century_Literature?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 44096, "name": "Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Knowledge?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 60607, "name": "August Strindberg", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/August_Strindberg?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 284574, "name": "Carl von Linn\u00e9", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Carl_von_Linne?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 548474, "name": "Linnean Classification Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linnean_Classification_Systems?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1418898, "name": "Islands and Archipelagos", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islands_and_Archipelagos?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 36393378, "title": "Lecl\u00e9zien Hybridity, Relations Across Genres, Histories, and Cultures in Selected Works", "created_at": "2018-04-12T08:14:27.720-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36393378/Lecl%C3%A9zien_Hybridity_Relations_Across_Genres_Histories_and_Cultures_in_Selected_Works?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_36393378", "summary": "This dissertation explores the representation of hybridity in selected works of Nobel Laureate JMG Le Cl\u00e9zio. More particularly, I define hybridity as the intersection of literary and artistic generic diversity, fictional and historic discourses and heterogeneous world cultures. I propose to consider the generic diversity that characterizes the author\u2019s work as a means to mirror the cultural and historical heterogeneity of our world today. \n\nUntil now, lecl\u00e9zien scholars have separately examined historiographical elements, representations of regional cultures and generic diversity within the boundaries of French literary theory. Indeed, these studies provide valuable stylistic, thematic and historical insights. However, by\ninvestigating these elements in concert and in the context of current discussions of hybridity in Francophone studies, my dissertation sheds a new light on the relationships between multiple genres, diverse fictive and historical discourses and geographical spaces that\ndistinguish Le Cl\u00e9zio\u2019s works.\n\nIn my first chapter, I discuss the key concepts of hybridity in Francophone literary and cultural studies while also considering the ongoing debate concerning a regional or transcultural approach to Le Cl\u00e9zio\u2019s works within the context of French and Francophone studies. Having established this methodological basis, in chapters two through four, I examine the intersections of genres, histories and cultures in two recent literary works, \n\"R\u00e9volutions\" (2003), \"C\u0153ur br\u00fble et autres romances\" (2000) and the author\u2019s recent exhibit at the Louvre from November 2011-February 2012, \"Le Mus\u00e9e Monde\".\n\nI contend that by privileging transversal encounters between genres, histories and cultures, Le Cl\u00e9zio incites an engaged reader, or viewer, response to construct new, Relational histories and identities, an affective response of Relation to embrace the Toutmonde as suggested by Martiniquais writer and philosopher, Edouard Glissant.\n\nThrough my research, it is my intention to underline the socio-cultural value of Le Cl\u00e9zio\u2019s work in promoting intercultural understanding. What is more, my aim is to shine light on potential transversal methods for Francophone scholars who approach literary, performing and visual arts in our twenty-first century globalizing world.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56303938, "asset_id": 36393378, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 55821862, "first_name": "Martha", "last_name": "van der Drift", "domain_name": "duke", "page_name": "MarthavanderDrift", "display_name": "Martha  van der Drift", "profile_url": "https://duke.academia.edu/MarthavanderDrift?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/55821862/19412199/19328375/s65_martha.van_der_drift.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 51006, "name": "Museography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museography?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53034, "name": "Cultural hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 69164, "name": "Edouard Glissant", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Edouard_Glissant?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 443121, "name": "Generic Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Generic_Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 656386, "name": "J.M.G Le Cl\u00e9zio", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/J.M.G_Le_Clezio?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 35356615, "title": "Unreflective Criticalness?

(2017) Nothing more than a conceptual lens? Situating hybridity in social inquiry, in Lemay-H\u00e9bert, N. and R. Freedman (eds.) Hybridity: law, culture and development, London: Routdlegde, 17-36.\n\nAbstract:\nIn this chapter I will argue that it is not the use of hybridity per se that will decide if an analytical puzzle or policy problem can be solved, but that this question depends on the positioning of social researchers and decision makers. By reviewing transitology, institutionalist statebuilding and critical peacebuilding literatures, I will show how hybridity is applied both in Western-centrist and evolutionary thinking and ideas of potentially more emancipatory 'hybrid' and 'post-liberal forms of peace'. The subsequent exploration of applications of hybridity in analyses of situations of protracted crisis and 'governance without government' highlights how the application of hybrid solutions can lead to violence, marginalisation and other regressive outcomes despite such emancipatory potential. On this basis, the importance of an ontological understanding of hybridity, i.e. on what is being hybridised or hybrid, is discussed in the third section in order to argue that it is the realm of ideas that should be given more attention in hybridity research. The usefulness of the concept of 'hybrid subjectivities' will be exemplified by briefly reviewing the case of political transition in post-Soviet Central Asia and the hybridisation processes that occur in this environment characterised by multiple informational spaces, subjectivities and worldviews.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53996781, "asset_id": 31768475, "asset_type": "Work",

element in cultural fertilization for Eastern countries such as Iran and India which have been stereotyped negatively by the Westerners due to the fake devised narratives against them throughout

The purpose of the present article is to reveal how texts written by the Orientals in the language of the Western colonizer introduce the real culture of the previously codified Eastern countries and neutralizes the propounded Western notions regarding the strange and threatening narratives about Otherness in the land of the colonizer. Works of Eastern writers such as Firoozeh Jazayeri Dumas and Jhumpa Lahiri are suitable sources for having a postcolonial study to provide information about the results of identity crisis and hybridity. The consequences of Diaspora are universal issues which are shared among a variety of nationalities. Although leaving ones homeland is supposed to have negative effects on the lives of the immigrants, the two novels reveal that if the individuals possess a certain degree of flexibility, the emerged Third Space would provide a productive life. Also these novels have dis-Orientalization effects which can mend the stigmatized Eastern cultures through talking about their nice and pleasant aspects of family relationships, costumes, and religion.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52030372, "asset_id": 31717390, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1041655, "first_name": "Hanieh", "last_name": "MehreMotlaq", "domain_name": "kiau", "page_name": "HaniehMehreMotlaq", "display_name": "Hanieh MehreMotlaq", "profile_url": "https://kiau.academia.edu/HaniehMehreMotlaq?f_ri=4138", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23791, "name": "Third Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Third_Space?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 51334, "name": "Orientalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Orientalism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1422602, "name": "Jumpa Lahiri", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jumpa_Lahiri?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 31539344, "title": "\"Corps hybrides, corps monstrueux?

The focus is on how concepts of geography, body,\nspace, community, heritage, tradition and identity have become conflated within processes of\nsocial change. \u2018Jazzing\u2019, otherwise known as \u2018Cape jazz\u2019 dance, or \u2018jazz\u2019, danced to what is locally\nknown as \u2018jazz\u2019 music (mostly R&B and soul \u2018covers\u2019), is associated with the apartheid-constructed\n\u2018coloured\u2019 community, a historically contested identity in the Western Cape. Salsa, as a globally\npopularised and commercialised dance form, danced to salsa music, started in central Cape Town\nin the early 2000s, incorporating participants from diverse backgrounds. Because of similarities in\nstyle, and the informality and fluidity of both dance forms, tensions emerged in the mid-2000s,\nwhen many jazz dancers, influenced by the local salsa scene, copied and incorporated what were\ndescribed as \u2018salsa moves\u2019 into jazz routines, resulting in contestations over whether what was\nseen as a \u2018local\u2019 tradition was under threat. At the same time, the crossing over of dance styles and\ndancers between venues resulted in modes of racial integration and inclusivity within a highly\nsegregated society. The study argues for the use of dance as a lens to explore, contest, interrogate\nand problematise a rapidly transforming society, and what it means to be South African today.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38828871, "asset_id": 15923436, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4701652, "first_name": "Jade", "last_name": "Gibson", "domain_name": "uct", "page_name": "JadeGibson", "display_name": "Jade Gibson", "profile_url": "https://uct.academia.edu/JadeGibson?f_ri=4138", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 687, "name": "Musicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Musicology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1556, "name": "Dance Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dance_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4125, "name": "Global cities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_cities?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4260, "name": "Anthropology Of Dance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_Of_Dance?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5044, "name": "Embodiment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Embodiment?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 11483, "name": "Cultural Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Memory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 16742, "name": "Urban Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Sociology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 54259, "name": "Cities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cities?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 11625325, "title": "Rethinking Environmental Sustainability in the Anthropocene -Environmental Politics 2013", "created_at": "2015-03-24T00:42:56.746-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11625325/Rethinking_Environmental_Sustainability_in_the_Anthropocene_Environmental_Politics_2013?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_11625325", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37093151, "asset_id": 11625325, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 201484, "first_name": "Manuel", "last_name": "Arias Maldonado", "domain_name": "uma", "page_name": "ManuelAriasMaldonado", "display_name": "Manuel  Arias Maldonado", "profile_url": "https://uma.academia.edu/ManuelAriasMaldonado?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/201484/47428/15079249/s65_manuel.arias_maldonado.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18845, "name": "Environmental Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Sustainability?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33319, "name": "Nature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nature?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 36059, "name": "Environmentalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmentalism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 9894836, "title": "Neglected Peripheries: Discovering Hybridity in Transylvania", "created_at": "2014-12-25T04:25:38.863-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9894836/Neglected_Peripheries_Discovering_Hybridity_in_Transylvania?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_9894836", "summary": "The paper builds on the general premise that scholarly approaches to ethnic diversity in Romania (or Central and Eastern Europe in general) follow the theoretical lines informing the top-down study of nationalism and ethnicity which focus on the binary logic of national majority-minority relations, and envision the coexistence of separate, parallel, ethnocultural \u2018worlds\u2019 and \u2018ethnic groups\u2019 in a multicultural framework. Social research does not make the next theoretical step towards, first acknowledging, then analyzing and theorizing the multiple occurrences of cultural and ethnic \u2018mixtures\u2019. The aim of the paper is to argue for an alternative perspective which can address the neglected phenomena of \u2018ethnic hybridity\u2019 or \u2018hybrid identities\u2019 arising from ambiguities of identification and belonging in the \u2018peripheries\u2019 of Transylvania. Focusing on surveys addressing the topics of inter-marriage, bilingualism and media consumption in the discussed region, the paper claims that there is strong empirical evidence to support such an alternative theoretical approach in framing and defining ethnic diversity in Transylvania. The paper concludes that the social and cultural particularities of the \u2018peripheries\u2019 produce a mixed socialization that determines the emerging \u2018hybrid identities\u2019. Put differently: if the usual markers of ethnicity, like descent/family, language and social/cultural practices have such a heterogeneous and mixed nature then the resulting ethnicity, or ethnic identity, will be a \u2018hybrid\u2019 one.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36052731, "asset_id": 9894836, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3132051, "first_name": "Szabolcs", "last_name": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3", "domain_name": "indiana", "page_name": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3Szabolcs", "display_name": "Szabolcs L\u00e1szl\u00f3", "profile_url": "https://indiana.academia.edu/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3Szabolcs?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3132051/1029637/36300297/s65_l_szl_.szabolcs.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5815, "name": "Identity politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_politics?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9547, "name": "Minority Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18922, "name": "Transylvania", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transylvania?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 48952, "name": "Romania", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Romania?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 106306, "name": "Interculturality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interculturality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 179481, "name": "Assimilation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Assimilation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 186492, "name": "Empirical Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Empirical_Research?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 654801, "name": "Rogers Brubaker", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rogers_Brubaker?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 9875607, "title": "L'espace en r\u00e9sonance : corps, ville et monde dans Etoiles mourantes d'Ayerdahl et J.-C.

The contribution explores amateur films made in the Dutch province of Limburg, zooming in on publicly accessible films in the \u2018film collection Limburg\u2019, whose contents and historical development are described. Three different manifestations of amateur films in Limburg are distinguished and analysed: family and hobby films, club films, and \u2018alternative\u2019 films. For the historical analysis of these manifestations of amateur film and their related modes of practice, the study applies a framework zeroing in on transition periods, referring to both technological and social-cultural developments, rather than successive periods of practice dominated by a specific technology. Specific attention is given to interactions between user generations. It turns out, for instance, that many amateur club filmmakers skipped analogue video and continued filming on super-8 till digital video offered appropriate editing tools. In general, for a relatively long time, amateur filmmaking in Limburg remained a rather exclusive hobby for elite men. Club activities only emerged after WWII, which explains the lack of a strong avant-garde filmmaking tradition in Limburg. Euregional activities troubled the relationships with the national association of amateur filmmakers in the 1970s. Infrastructures for the dissemination of amateur films, such as local youth centres or provincial television broadcasting, and the emergence of global media platforms, such as YouTube, challenge the relationships between amateurs and professionals up until today.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 72099288, "asset_id": 56977050, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49412234, "first_name": "Joseph", "last_name": "Wachelder", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JosephWachelder", "display_name": "Joseph Wachelder", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JosephWachelder?f_ri=4138", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 8358919, "first_name": "Tim", "last_name": "van der Heijden", "domain_name": "ou-nl", "page_name": "TimvanderHeijden", "display_name": "Tim van der Heijden", "profile_url": "https://ou-nl.academia.edu/TimvanderHeijden?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8358919/2851098/11106485/s65_tim.van_der_heijden.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 136, "name": "Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11483, "name": "Cultural Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Memory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 79532, "name": "Amateur Film", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amateur_Film?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 844594, "name": "History of limburg", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_limburg?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2850805, "name": "Limburg (NL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Limburg_NL_?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 50148477, "title": "Juda\u00efsme et \u00ab hybridit\u00e9 \u00bb", "created_at": "2021-07-22T03:05:09.042-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/50148477/Juda%C3%AFsme_et_hybridit%C3%A9_?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_50148477", "summary": "R\u00e9sum\u00e9 des enseignements 2016-2020.

The issue is poignant and relatable to a lot of hybridized minds who try and fail continuously to cater to the spatial re-designing of themselves. But the portrayal is neither an issue in its objective veracity nor in its attempt to de-classify the ontological anguish of displacement. When any adaptation becomes the strategic tool to tell a story, an entirely new politics comes to the forefront: politics of interpretation. Such a case becomes quite problematic for the director\u2019s macroscopic vision as comparison between its source and performance develops into a questionable affair which often mars the subjectivity of two different platforms. The struggle goes on to the extent of having to produce a single winner amongst the two texts. Often, a body of adaptation falls into the category of some categorical simulacra with a reductionist effect upon the body of source. Mira Nair attempts to handle such discursive ideas within her direction pretty well and builds up a connecting textual tissue with Lahiri\u2019s text. The Namesake expresses a reassuring faith in family solidarity. Avoiding the clich\u00e9 of pitting disobedient immigrant children in pitched battles against tradition-bound parents from the old country, the film assumes that blood ties are the strongest bonds holding together the social order.\nKeywords: displacement, hybridity, adaptation, simulacra, immigrant.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67962799, "asset_id": 49678504, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 160461992, "first_name": "Richik", "last_name": "Banerjee", "domain_name": "caluniv", "page_name": "RichikBanerjee", "display_name": "Richik Banerjee", "profile_url": "https://caluniv.academia.edu/RichikBanerjee?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/160461992/44980020/35227456/s65_richik.banerjee.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1555, "name": "Film Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11355, "name": "South Asian Diaspora Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Diaspora_Literature?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42298, "name": "Film and Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_and_Media_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 53034, "name": "Cultural hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1141730, "name": "Mira Nair", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mira_Nair?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1485767, "name": "The Namesake", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Namesake?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 45170881, "title": "Scenes of Hope, Acts of Despair: Deidealizing Hybridity in Saya Woolfalk's World of the Empathics", "created_at": "2021-02-22T11:21:04.330-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45170881/Scenes_of_Hope_Acts_of_Despair_Deidealizing_Hybridity_in_Saya_Woolfalks_World_of_the_Empathics?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_45170881", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65753178, "asset_id": 45170881, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 15803107, "first_name": "Anna", "last_name": "Storti", "domain_name": "duke", "page_name": "AnnaStorti", "display_name": "Anna Storti", "profile_url": "https://duke.academia.edu/AnnaStorti?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/15803107/4271269/20046689/s65_anna.storti.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1192, "name": "Feminist Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminist_Theory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2337, "name": "Performance Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5463, "name": "Performance Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance_Art?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 29719, "name": "Critical Mixed Race Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Mixed_Race_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 44886, "name": "Empathy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Empathy?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 48174, "name": "Temporality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Temporality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 49043, "name": "Utopia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Utopia?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 80848, "name": "Mixed Race Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mixed_Race_Identity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 114059, "name": "Dystopia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dystopia?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 265454, "name": "Ancestry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancestry?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 628086, "name": "Critical Mixed-Race/Multiracial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Mixed-Race_Multiracial_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2606057, "name": "Saya Woolfalk", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Saya_Woolfalk?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 45024978, "title": "Journal of Contemporary Thought", "created_at": "2021-02-01T03:15:12.249-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45024978/Journal_of_Contemporary_Thought?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_45024978", "summary": "In Memoriam of Bhupen Khakhar (1934 -

(2020). This article explores Greek alternative media, records their hybridity and analyses them under the prism of political economy. Drawing theoretically on researchers who emphasize the elusiveness and heterogeneity of alternative media and examining them on account of their ownership structures, production practices and media content, I propose their conceptualization as a vibrant organism in a constant dialectic relationship with mainstream media. These \u2018alternative hybrid media\u2019 may borrow people, ideas and practices from mainstream media, but they do not compromise their values for the pursuit of profit or political power. This article focuses on Efimerida ton Syntakton, the country\u2019s first national cooperative newspaper, which emerged out of a collective of laid-off journalists and constitutes a representative example of the hybridity that characterizes the Greek alternative media ecosystem. Based on interviews with journalists and secondary data, this article aims to point to the defining characteristics of \u2018alternative hybrid media\u2019 and generate a deeper insight into the complex area of alternative media.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65131720, "asset_id": 44659569, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6917207, "first_name": "Lambrini", "last_name": "Papadopoulou", "domain_name": "en-uoa-gr", "page_name": "enuoagracademiaeduLambriniPapadopoulou", "display_name": "Lambrini Papadopoulou", "profile_url": "https://en-uoa-gr.academia.edu/enuoagracademiaeduLambriniPapadopoulou?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6917207/5046341/99891093/s65_lambrini.papadopoulou.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 802, "name": "Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Economy?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 994, "name": "Journalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Journalism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13958, "name": "Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16547, "name": "Alternative Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alternative_Media?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 19013, "name": "Cooperatives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cooperatives?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 48044, "name": "Greece", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Greece?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 44638348, "title": "Traducir el Caribe, una traves\u00eda rizom\u00e1tica: propuestas para una traducci\u00f3n feminista y descolonial a partir de \"Travers\u00e9e de la Mangrove\", de Maryse Cond\u00e9", "created_at": "2020-12-04T16:21:11.897-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44638348/Traducir_el_Caribe_una_traves%C3%ADa_rizom%C3%A1tica_propuestas_para_una_traducci%C3%B3n_feminista_y_descolonial_a_partir_de_Travers%C3%A9e_de_la_Mangrove_de_Maryse_Cond%C3%A9?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_44638348", "summary": "El Caribe ha sido, a lo largo de los siglos, un espacio testigo de los choques e influjos de m\u00faltiples pueblos, cuyas semillas han terminado fructificando en cosmovisiones y lenguas insospechadas.

Rejecting previous models for hybridity that use an additive, percentage-based logic, I use these characters to create a new framework for hybridity.  Beginning with the figure of the Jew as an example of alternative Otherness, I posit hybridity as an emergent entanglement, a unifying force that reconciles and reinforces the disparate parts of the self\u2014while retaining an Otherness all its own.  Ultimately, I envision this hybridity as a useful framework not only within Star Trek and science fiction, but as a larger framework to carry throughout theoretical explorations of identity and selfhood.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61884664, "asset_id": 41726127, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28157519, "first_name": "Eliza", "last_name": "Gellis", "domain_name": "purdue", "page_name": "ElizaGellis", "display_name": "Eliza Gellis", "profile_url": "https://purdue.academia.edu/ElizaGellis?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28157519/33222561/54931018/s65_eliza.gellis.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8694, "name": "Science Fiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_Fiction?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9477, "name": "Rhetorical Criticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rhetorical_Criticism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20306, "name": "Rhetorical Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rhetorical_Theory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 55039, "name": "Star Trek", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Star_Trek?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 41379584, "title": "Context Tension: Cultural Influences on Leadership and Management Practice", "created_at": "2019-12-20T22:53:25.517-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41379584/Context_Tension_Cultural_Influences_on_Leadership_and_Management_Practice?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_41379584", "summary": "The canon of knowledge in the fields of management and leadership has been developed from Western capitalist principles, with leading thinkers in the field being mainly of American or European descent.

Such an approach excludes hybrids from moral considerations due to their instrumental character. In the paper, we revisit the boundaries of moral considerability by reexamining the legitimacy of identifying intrinsic value with a non-instrumental one. We offer the concept of \"functional value,\" which we define as a simultaneous contribution to the common good of the ecosystem and the possibility to disclose the full variety of aspects of a being's identity.

Cults of saints such as that of the holy warrior George (d. 303), holy virgin and martyr Catherine of Alexandria (d. ca 305), or holy bishop of Myra Nicholas (d. 343) were highly popular both in the East and West, whereas other cults enjoyed a far greater veneration within one of the two churches and only a limited one within the other. For instance, pre-Schism saints such as the holy popes Clement I (d. 99) and Sylvester I (d. 335) or the founder of the Western monastic order St. Benedict of Nursia (d. 547) were highly revered within the Church of Rome; even though recognized by the Church of Constantinople, these saints received only an occasional veneration among the Orthodox. The Great Schism did not mean only the theological and institutional separation of the two Churches, but usually also the segregation of devotion: from that moment on, newly-canonized holy men and women were exclusively venerated by the faithful belonging to the respective Church which proclaimed them as saints.\nOn the basis of both textual and visual evidence, the present paper examines those cases of cross-credal devotion of post-Schism, Catholic saints by the Orthodox occurring during the Late Middle Ages in cultural contact zones, such as the Holy Land, Cyprus and Crete, Southern Italy, Dalmatian coastal towns, or Transylvania. In these territories found under foreign rule, the local Orthodox were greatly exposed to the dominant cultural model of the Latins, their response to it being sometimes reflected also in the religious and devotional sphere. Such trans-confessional forms of faith include: the Orthodox relevance of the cults of local \u2013 Venetian (St. Fosca of Torcello, d. 250/1), Sicilian (St. Catald of Taranto, canon. ca 685), or Limousin (St. Leonard of Noblac, d. 545) \u2013 saints in the Nativity Basilica in Bethlehem; the Slavic connection of the cult of St. Vitus (d. 303) and its ideological significance for medieval Serbia; the consequence of Franciscan and Dominican presence in Crete for the Orthodox veneration of St. Francis of Assisi (canon. 1228) and St. Peter of Verona (canon. 1253), respectively; or the assimilation of the cults of the holy kings of Hungary \u2013 Sts Stephen, Emeric (both canon. 1083), and Ladislas (canon. 1192) \u2013 by Romanian Orthodox noblemen in Transylvania.\nIn these instances of shared devotion by Catholics and Orthodox in medieval cultural contact zones, the Latin saints either preserved their Catholic devotional features within new, confessional contexts (i.e., Orthodox) or their cult was enriched with additional traits that were relevant from the point of view of Orthodox religious practice.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61055237, "asset_id": 40775425, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 725693, "first_name": "Dragos Gh.", "last_name": "Nastasoiu", "domain_name": "nec-ro", "page_name": "DragosGhNastasoiu", "display_name": "Dragos Gh.

Our aim here specifically is to understand the cultural consumption of young students from S\u00e3o Paulo and their uses of different media for this matter, in hybrid forms (mainly digital). The analysis of empirical data presented is built upon 52 exploratory questionnaires and 40 interviews conducted with young students (from 18 to 24 year old) living in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. In order to understand the Brazilian context in this analysis, we performed a triangulation with secondary data from \u201cBrazilian digital youth\u201d by IBOPE (2012) and \u201cConnected youth\u201d by Telefonica Foundation/USP (2014). Based on the analysis, we reflect on two central topics: 1) evidence of a digital divide, according to their socio-economic profile and their access to information/entertainment, and 2) possibilities of cosmopolitan encounters, through the consumption of international cultural products and the search of information regarding other countries and cultures.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60943786, "asset_id": 40659685, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33043818, "first_name": "Wilson", "last_name": "Bekesas", "domain_name": "espm", "page_name": "WBekesas", "display_name": "Wilson R Bekesas", "profile_url": "https://espm.academia.edu/WBekesas?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33043818/18918630/18870016/s65_wilson.bekesas.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9821, "name": "Brazil", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brazil?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25953, "name": "Young People", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Young_People?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26227, "name": "Entertainment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Entertainment?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 387266, "name": "Cultural consumption", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_consumption?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 453206, "name": "Cyber Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Culture?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 40347252, "title": "Bhabha\u2019n\u0131n Yaklas\u0327\u0131m\u0131 ile O\u0308mer Seyfettin\u2019in \u201cPrimo Tu\u0308rk C\u0327ocug\u0306u\u201d O\u0308yku\u0308lerindeki Yanl\u0131s\u0327 Bat\u0131l\u0131las\u0327ma ve Milli Bilincin Uyanmas\u0131", "created_at": "2019-09-14T06:45:01.641-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40347252/Bhabha_n%C4%B1n_Yaklas_%C4%B1m%C4%B1_ile_O_mer_Seyfettin_in_Primo_Tu_rk_C_ocug_u_O_yku_lerindeki_Yanl%C4%B1s_Bat%C4%B1l%C4%B1las_ma_ve_Milli_Bilincin_Uyanmas%C4%B1?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_40347252", "summary": "Postkolonyal teorisyen Homi Bhabha (1949-), kuram\u0131n\u0131 s\u00f6m\u00fcrgeci ve s\u00f6m\u00fcr\u00fclen aras\u0131ndaki ili\u015fkiye dayand\u0131rmaktad\u0131r.

This essay suggests a new context for Sidney's exordium by focusing primarily on its affiliation to the genre of the 'Art of Poetry'. In Horace's Ars poetica and other classical, scholastic and Renaissance treatises, horse-men and other unnatural hybrids embody the tension between decorum and poetic liberty. Three major traditions inform this trope: by the Renaissance the centaur could be an allegory of reason's struggle with the passions, an emblem of the poetic imagination, or a figure for compositional hybridity associated, especially, with Lucianic satire. Reading Sidney in the light of these traditions, finally, this essay explores aspects of the centaur's significance in the Defence and the Arcadia, and suggests that this kind of attention to metaphor might provide a bridge between critical and creative modes of Renaissance poetic thought.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62292915, "asset_id": 29437924, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 54581325, "first_name": "Micha", "last_name": "Lazarus", "domain_name": "huji", "page_name": "MichaLazarus", "display_name": "Micha Lazarus", "profile_url": "https://huji.academia.edu/MichaLazarus?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/54581325/14663467/38208271/s65_micha.lazarus.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 135, "name": "Intellectual History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intellectual_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 885, "name": "English Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Literature?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2987, "name": "Renaissance Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Renaissance_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3233, "name": "Animal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Animal_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3291, "name": "History and Classical tradition studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_and_Classical_tradition_studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 6223, "name": "English", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 6922, "name": "Poetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poetics?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 14766, "name": "Horace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Horace?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 15838, "name": "Imagination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imagination?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 16499, "name": "Genre Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genre_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 17916, "name": "Renaissance literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Renaissance_literature?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 22592, "name": "Sir Philip Sidney", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sir_Philip_Sidney?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 22599, "name": "Classical Reception Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Classical_Reception_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 31660, "name": "Aristotle's Rhetoric and Poetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aristotles_Rhetoric_and_Poetics?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 38317, "name": "History of Literary Criticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Literary_Criticism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 44996, "name": "Lucian", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lucian?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 88452, "name": "Menippean Satire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Menippean_Satire?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 374129, "name": "Centaurs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Centaurs?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 939416, "name": "Ancient Rhetoric and Poetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Rhetoric_and_Poetics?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 37931565, "title": "Taming Babel: Language in the Making of Malaysia by Rachel Leow", "created_at": "2018-12-07T05:14:53.384-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37931565/Taming_Babel_Language_in_the_Making_of_Malaysia_by_Rachel_Leow?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_37931565", "summary": "This book rethinks the politics of cultural diversity by examining how the idea of multilingualism became incompatible with the nation-state.

The paper argues that this is because leading approaches to resistance coming out the hybridity literature lack an account of class and privilege. These approaches have done a superficial application of the frameworks they were drawing on, primarily those of Michel De Certeau and James Scott. Resistance has been conceived as an international\u2013local and liberal\u2013non-liberal contention. The conclusion is that while the study of resistance is welcomed, this research agenda is limited and depoliticizing. Critics of hybridity have addressed similar points, taking issue with the account of the local, the lack of historicity and the reification of liberal norms. However, in seeing these problems as stemming from the everyday framework, they too have misread the importance of class and privilege therein. The article shows that Certeau and Scott have much to contribute to understanding peacebuilding processes by sustaining a sociological historicist and practice- based account of resistance as embodied in subordinate subjects. This has the potential to politicize, historicize and decolonize the liberal peace critique and to contribute to studying resistance in IR more generally.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56119158, "asset_id": 36216368, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1149946, "first_name": "marta", "last_name": "i\u00f1iguez de heredia", "domain_name": "uam", "page_name": "martai\u00f1iguezdeheredia", "display_name": "marta i\u00f1iguez de heredia", "profile_url": "https://uam.academia.edu/martai%C3%B1iguezdeheredia?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1149946/433677/704396/s65_marta.iniguez.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 948, "name": "Historical Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Sociology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17497, "name": "Sociology of Everyday Life", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Everyday_Life?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22801, "name": "Michel de Certeau", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Michel_de_Certeau?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26151, "name": "Liberal Peacebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liberal_Peacebuilding?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 45578, "name": "Peacebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peacebuilding?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 96098, "name": "Resistance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Resistance?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 699924, "name": "James C.

Having emerged in response to the experience of forced labour migration in the early 20th century, maskanda continues to straddle a wide range of cultural and musical universes. Maskanda musicians reground ideas, (hi)stories, norms, speech and beliefs that have been uprooted in centuries of colonial and apartheid rule by using specific musical textures, vocalities and idioms.\n\nWith an autoethnographic approach of how she came to understand and participate in maskanda, Titus indicates some instances where her acts of knowledge formation confronted, bridged or invaded those of other maskanda participants. Thus, the book not only aims to demonstrate the epistemic importance of music and aurality but also the performative and creative dimension of academic epistemic approaches such as ethnography, historiography and music analysis, that aim towards conceptualization and (visual) representation. In doing so, the book unearths the colonialist potential of knowledge formation at large and disrupts modes of thinking and (academic) research that are globally normative.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 230105, "first_name": "Barbara", "last_name": "Titus", "domain_name": "uva", "page_name": "BTitus", "display_name": "Barbara Titus", "profile_url": "https://uva.academia.edu/BTitus?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/230105/697062/865469/s65_barbara.titus.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1631, "name": "Popular Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Music?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1987, "name": "Ethnomusicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnomusicology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5527, "name": "Knowledge sharing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Knowledge_sharing?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 9730, "name": "Apartheid", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Apartheid?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 9900, "name": "Cultural Musicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Musicology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 11312, "name": "Subalternity, Subaltern Agency", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subalternity_Subaltern_Agency?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 17035, "name": "Music Industry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music_Industry?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 30045, "name": "Homi Bhabha (Cultural Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homi_Bhabha_Cultural_Theory_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 50767, "name": "Ambivalence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ambivalence?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 52197, "name": "Colonial Discourse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Discourse?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 60193, "name": "Experience", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Experience?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 61866, "name": "South Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Africa?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 69170, "name": "Paul Gilroy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Paul_Gilroy?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 82175, "name": "Deconstructivism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deconstructivism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 118423, "name": "Forced migration and Labour migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forced_migration_and_Labour_migration?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 149890, "name": "Race and identity in post-apartheid South Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_identity_in_post-apartheid_South_Africa?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 170697, "name": "Musical Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Musical_Analysis?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 179294, "name": "Mimicry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mimicry?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 251886, "name": "Participant Observation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Participant_Observation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 308615, "name": "Zulu cultural history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zulu_cultural_history?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 342903, "name": "Music analysis and performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music_analysis_and_performance?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 526825, "name": "Sara Ahmed", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sara_Ahmed?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 536559, "name": "Double Consciousness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Double_Consciousness?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 544455, "name": "Maskanda", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maskanda?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 544560, "name": "Music as knowledge (transfer) system", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music_as_knowledge_transfer_system?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 632795, "name": "Musical Epistemology (Music As Knowledge)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Musical_Epistemology_Music_As_Knowledge_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2474142, "name": "Uprootings/Regroundings", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Uprootings_Regroundings?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 22637770, "title": "\u00ab Sur les origines iconographiques de la Sir\u00e8ne en Gr\u00e8ce ancienne : des hypoth\u00e8ses avanc\u00e9es depuis un si\u00e8cle aux derni\u00e8res d\u00e9couvertes \u00bb, in SERES H\u00cdBRIDOS.

Enjoying a certain autonomy within the kingdom's structure, these districta Valachorum were inhabited mainly by Vlachs (Romanians), which adopted earlier on Christianity in its Byzantine-Slavic variant, but needed continuously to cope with their Catholic and more powerful lords. A consequence of the activity of the local landowners (cnezi, sing. cnez) in the 14th and 15th century is the foundation of churches on their estates and their decoration with mural painting. These pastiches of western ecclesiastical architecture, embellished with Romanesque and Gothic stonework, display either a good-quality or provincial mural decoration, but attests unequivocally their usage by the Orthodox. By examining the selection of particular themes belonging to traditional Byzantine iconography and their enrichment with motifs coming from apocryphal sources, as well as the preference for Western iconographic redactions, or even the presence of Catholic saints in the iconographic program of a series of Transylvanian churches, the present paper seeks to challenge the traditional categories of Orthodox/Eastern and Catholic/Western art; these categories prove themselves inapplicable to the religious art of 14th- and 15th-century Transylvania, a region situated in between two cultural traditions, East and West, and a culture which gave birth to a hybrid art escaping traditional art-historical labeling.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 41815837, "asset_id": 5928658, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 41815848, "asset_id": 5928658, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 725693, "first_name": "Dragos Gh.", "last_name": "Nastasoiu", "domain_name": "nec-ro", "page_name": "DragosGhNastasoiu", "display_name": "Dragos Gh.

Recent transcriptome studies on the asexual polyploid complex Ranunculus auricomus using single-nucleotide polymorphisms confirmed neutral allelic sequence divergence within a short time frame, but rejected a hypothesis of a genome wide accumulation of mutations in asexuals compared to sexuals, except for a few genes related to reproductive development. We discuss a general model that the observed incidence of facultative sexuality in plants may unmask deleterious mutations with partial dominance and expose them efficiently to purging selection. A little bit of sex may help to avoid genomic decay and extinction.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36731166, "asset_id": 10997645, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2128210, "first_name": "Diego", "last_name": "Hojsgaard", "domain_name": "ipk-gatersleben", "page_name": "DiegoHojsgaard", "display_name": "Diego Hojsgaard", "profile_url": "https://ipk-gatersleben.academia.edu/DiegoHojsgaard?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2128210/690544/857178/s65_diego.hojsgaard.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 155, "name": "Evolutionary Biology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Evolutionary_Biology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4714, "name": "Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexuality?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 40609, "name": "Polyploidy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Polyploidy?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54892, "name": "Asexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asexuality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 334979, "name": "Apomixis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Apomixis?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1824435, "name": "Muller\u00b4s ratchet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muller_s_ratchet?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1824436, "name": "Meselson effect", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Meselson_effect?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 8669221, "title": "Le dauphin comme hybride dans l'univers dionysiaque / Dolphins as some hybrids in the world of Dionysos", "created_at": "2014-10-06T23:14:29.596-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8669221/Le_dauphin_comme_hybride_dans_lunivers_dionysiaque_Dolphins_as_some_hybrids_in_the_world_of_Dionysos?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_8669221", "summary": "On Dionysus, dolphins and hybridity\r\n\r\n(N.B.

(2000:125) This argument suggests that diaspora disrupts fixed notions of identity, and instead forms the basis of a transcultural hybridity which problematizes essentialist and primordial associations of identity based upon place and race.\nThis paper will critically examine the emancipatory potentialities of diaspora put forward by Gilroy. It will argue that this understanding frames diaspora only in terms of the host country, and fails to acknowledge the manner in which the invocation of diaspora in countries of origin can be mobilised in markedly differed ways with markedly different consequences. This article will contend that far from being \u2018incompatible with\u2026..nationalist and raciological thinking\u2019, notions of diaspora can in fact form an integral part of the technologies and discourses which construct the nation-state as culturally and racially homogenous.\nThis will be demonstrated with reference to the case of Ireland; it will explore the \u2018discursive political reformulation of Ireland as a \u2018diaspora nation\u2019 (Lentin 2007) and examine the centrality of diaspora to the shift towards a blood-based, \u2018jus sanguinis\u2019 model of citizenship. This argument will suggest that diaspora has played a vital role in the racialization of Irishness and the construction of Ireland as a racial state. In line with this, it will conclude that Gilroy\u2019s theorisation of diaspora as incongruent with raciological thinking is ultimately untenable.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36403515, "asset_id": 10337369, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9006630, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Dunne", "domain_name": "tcd", "page_name": "DavidDunne", "display_name": "David Dunne", "profile_url": "https://tcd.academia.edu/DavidDunne?f_ri=4138", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8, "name": "Critical Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Theory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21041, "name": "Racialization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racialization?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 69170, "name": "Paul Gilroy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Paul_Gilroy?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 9865264, "title": "Review: The Archaeology of Hybrid Material Culture (2013)", "created_at": "2014-12-22T08:42:04.347-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9865264/Review_The_Archaeology_of_Hybrid_Material_Culture_2013_?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_9865264", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36028221, "asset_id": 9865264, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 267025, "first_name": "Parker", "last_name": "VanValkenburgh", "domain_name": "brown", "page_name": "ParkerVanValkenburgh", "display_name": "Parker VanValkenburgh", "profile_url": "https://brown.academia.edu/ParkerVanValkenburgh?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/267025/55842/21791910/s65_parker.vanvalkenburgh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5346, "name": "Archaeological Method & Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Method_and_Theory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18821, "name": "Archaeological Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Theory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48523, "name": "Book Reviews", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Book_Reviews?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53034, "name": "Cultural hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_hybridity?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 8664975, "title": "Die Blendung des Kyklopen - Antikenrezeption und (post-)kolonialer Diskurs", "created_at": "2014-10-06T18:29:14.492-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8664975/Die_Blendung_des_Kyklopen_Antikenrezeption_und_post_kolonialer_Diskurs?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_8664975", "summary": "The essay discusses the concept of \"black classicism\" in the light of postcolonial theory.

on the Brazilian sociologist Gilberto Freyre (1900-1987). It is my goal to demonstrate how Freyre applied Nietzschean ideas to his interpretation of Brazilian society in an attempt to concretize the prophecy of the \u201cnew man\u201d in the shape of the multiracial \u201cmesti\u00e7o.\u201d By Nietzschean ideas I mean ideas indebted to Nietzsche directly or indirectly and reflected in the rhetorical, stylistic and argumentative strategies used by Freyre. It is not my intention to discuss whether Freyre interpreted Nietzsche\u2019s ideas correctly; rather, I wish to highlight parallels to Nietzschean concepts and to indicate how the eclectic, even opportunistic, use of Nietzsche\u2019s work allowed Freyre to move the discussion on Brazilian identity in a new direction. \r\n\r\nCasa-grande & Senzala (1933), a obra secular de Gilberto Freyre, foi traditionalmente interpretado de um ponto de vista soci\u00f3logo e hist\u00f3rico. Esta interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o deixou duas quest\u00f5es essenciais em aberto: 1) Como se pode explicar que Freyre interpretou a no\u00e7\u00e3o de miscegena\u00e7\u00e3o de uma forma (muito) mais positiva do que soci\u00f3logos anteriores e 2) Como se pode explicar as tend\u00eancias elitistas e aristocr\u00e1ticas na sua obra? Este artigo explore estas duas perguntas analisando a influ\u00eancia em Freyre da filosofia de Friedrich Nietzsche atrav\u00e9s da interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o de Henry L. Mencken. Argumenta que a influ\u00eancia de Mencken foi maior do que tradicionalmente tem sido admitido e que na obra de Mencken sobre Nietzsche se pode encontrar a mesma interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o de miscigena\u00e7\u00e3o que Freyre mais tarde explorou em Casa-grande & Senzala. Argumenta tamb\u00e9m que Mencken profundamente influenciou Freyre com as suas ideias aristocr\u00e1ticas e elitistas.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56259029, "asset_id": 7641742,

tourism culture as it operates where commercial hospitality is on offer, especially at hotels and resorts in developing countries.  It is suggested that three quite distinct perspectives can assist in helping us understand this aspect of tourism culture, which emerges where worker and tourist roles inevitably converge and interact.  In themselves, such perspectives are not new, but they rarely seem to have been applied in the context of hotels and resorts.  The first perspective, derived from the work of Homi Bhabha, conceives of tourism culture as hybrid in nature, operating in a \u2018third space\u2019 between tourist and \u2018host,\u2019 and directs attention to the uncertain and negotiated aspects of tourism culture.  In the second, that of the socio-technical system, tourism culture is seen as an interface between, on the one hand, the formal operational rules and procedures designed to deliver an organisation\u2019s mission and, on the other hand, the on-going and lived-in cultures brought into the  \u2018system\u2019 by tourists and the hospitality providers.  The third perspective, that of the total institution, derived from Goffman, focuses to the social and physical boundaries that separate the hotel or resort from the outside world and on the cultural practices that serve to further differentiate it and its population from the outside.  It is suggested that use of these perspectives can further our understanding of the nature of tourism at different destinations and the ways hotels and similar institutions impact on both staff members and holidaymakers.  As a consequence, they are theoretically, empirically relevant and politically important.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32807017, "asset_id": 5786809, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81170, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Lugosi", "domain_name": "oxfordbrookes", "page_name": "PeterLugosi", "display_name": "Peter Lugosi", "profile_url": "https://oxfordbrookes.academia.edu/PeterLugosi?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81170/96350/110062/s65_peter.lugosi.jpg"}, {"id": 2795816, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Harrison", "domain_name": "usp-fj", "page_name": "DavidHarrison", "display_name": "David Harrison", "profile_url": "https://usp-fj.academia.edu/DavidHarrison?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2795816/915712/1144416/s65_david.harrison.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 909, "name": "Tourism Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 943, "name": "Tourism Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism_Management?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2729, "name": "Hospitality Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hospitality_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2919, "name": "Organizational Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organizational_Culture?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3956, "name": "Hospitality Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hospitality_Management?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7125, "name": "Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 8356, "name": "Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 15603, "name": "Sustainability in Hotels & Resorts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainability_in_Hotels_and_Resorts?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 15604, "name": "Hotel Operations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hotel_Operations?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 22656, "name": "Hospitality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hospitality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 30045, "name": "Homi Bhabha (Cultural Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homi_Bhabha_Cultural_Theory_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 34302, "name": "Tourism and Culture (Anthropology of Tourism)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism_and_Culture_Anthropology_of_Tourism_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 39359, "name": "Erving Goffman", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Erving_Goffman?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 43883, "name": "Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 53034, "name": "Cultural hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 81104, "name": "Tourism and Hotel Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism_and_Hotel_Management?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 91377, "name": "Human Resources in Tourism and Hospitality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Resources_in_Tourism_and_Hospitality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 91380, "name": "Hotel Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hotel_Management?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 91512, "name": "Resort Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Resort_Management?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 126213, "name": "Hotels", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hotels?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 180905, "name": "Total Institutions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Total_Institutions?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 4769913, "title": "\"Hybridity\" -

It can be argued that the Javanese descendant\u2019s communities in Malaysia are too complex to define in terms of identity and self-images. For example, while our respondents in this research persistently maintain their Javanese identity and customs, they also strongly embrace the local Malay conformity. Based on the preliminary findings, this research reveals that the female Javanese descendants in Malaysia engage with devotional and democratic viewing to produce the sense of reflexive identity and interpretive identity practices in relation to their hybrid identity construction. Growing up as Javanese, Malay and Malaysians, their identity formation contribute to the Southeast Asian literatures of ethnic identity debate and television culture in the transnational contexts.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31593245, "asset_id": 4061228, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 261622, "first_name": "MD", "last_name": "Azalanshah", "domain_name": "malaya", "page_name": "MDAzalanshah", "display_name": "MD Azalanshah", "profile_url": "https://malaya.academia.edu/MDAzalanshah?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/261622/64412/71034/s65_md.azalanshah.jpg"}, {"id": 5624387, "first_name": "Lily", "last_name": "Rofil", "domain_name": "myum", "page_name": "LilyRofil", "display_name": "Lily E F Rofil", "profile_url": "https://myum.academia.edu/LilyRofil?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5624387/2899969/3387819/s65_lily.el.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2858, "name": "Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Culture?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5583, "name": "Audience and Reception Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Audience_and_Reception_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 110697, "name": "Transformational Identities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transformational_Identities?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 970033, "name": "Multiplicity In Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiplicity_In_Identity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 970037, "name": "Social Constructs of Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Constructs_of_Identity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 977410, "name": "Malaysian Modernity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Modernity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1007067, "name": "Women and Modernity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_Modernity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1007073, "name": "Television In Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Television_In_Malaysia?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 3052465, "title": "\u201cBeyond Creolization and Hybridity: Entangled and Transcultural Identities in Philistia,\u201d ", "created_at": "2013-03-18T12:26:06.733-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3052465/_Beyond_Creolization_and_Hybridity_Entangled_and_Transcultural_Identities_in_Philistia_?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_3052465", "summary": "The appearance, definition and transformation of the Philistine culture of the Iron Age Southern Levant has been seen as part of the so-called \u201cSea Peoples\u201d phenomenon of the transition between the Late Bronze and Iron Ages. In the past, most interpretative frameworks understood this culture as being a largely intrusive, migratory phenomenon, which when arriving, forcibly took over from the Canaanite culture which had been dominant in the region beforehand, and replaced it with a largely Aegean-oriented culture. According to this view, with time, the Philistine culture was more and more influenced by local Levantine cultural norms, ultimately leading to the later Iron Age Philistine culture becoming a much less foreign oriented culture. This latter process has by and large been interpreted either as processes of assimilation, acculturation, or creolization.\r\nRecent finds and new perspectives warrant a new understanding of the underlying mechanisms and processes relating to the Philistine culture \u2013 from its appearance in the 12th cent BCE until its ultimate demise in the late Iron Age, in the 7th cent. BCE. While it is evident that a major component of the Philistine culture is foreign, it is clear that these foreign facets are of a mixed nature \u2013 including features from the Aegean, Cyprus, Anatolia, SE Europe and beyond. Likewise, it is now clear that the Philistines did not capture and destroy the Late Bronze Age sites of the Canaanites, at most destroying elite zones in some of the sites. On the contrary it appears that from the very beginning of the Iron Age, the foreign components became entangled with local Canaanite elements. Thus, from the very early stages of its appearance, the Philistine culture was characterized by an ongoing negotiation between various cultural groups of local and foreign origin.\r\nAs a result of such entanglements, the process of change of the Philistine culture should not be viewed through the lens of a simplistic process of cultural change. Here as well, multivalent patterns of identity negotiation can be seen between the various groups within Philistia (as evidenced in distinct material culture patterns at different sites within Philistia), and between these groups and surrounding polities and ethnicities, with influences going in both directions. While the Philistine culture did change drastically throughout the Iron Age, shedding many of their earlier, non-local attributes, other attributes which clearly were of importance in their ongoing group definition and identity continued to be used throughout the Iron Age.\r\nThus, we suggest that a more complex, multivalent and multi-directional framework is needed for a more robust understanding of these processes. In our paper we will argue for a transcultural, entangled perspective \u2013 which we believe can provide a more nuanced framework for understanding the formation and transformation of Philistine identity. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30982509, "asset_id": 3052465, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 445947, "first_name": "Louise", "last_name": "Hitchcock", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "LouiseHitchcock", "display_name": "Louise Hitchcock", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/LouiseHitchcock?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/445947/144237/1083068/s65_louise.hitchcock.jpg"}, {"id": 1581801, "first_name": "Aren", "last_name": "Maeir", "domain_name": "biu", "page_name": "AMaeir", "display_name": "Aren M .

After describing the diverse meanings of anthropophagy, I outline three important moments in Brazilian history where the concept has been central to understanding intercultural mixture. First, anthropophagy was an important\ncomponent of indigenous reactions to intercultural contact, providing a ritual mechanism by which to negotiate identity. This identity crafting mechanism became revived in the 20th century modernist and tropicalist periods, where it took on symbolic functions in positioning modern Brazilian identity with respect to both European and indigenous roots. More recently, anthropophagy has entered the organizational literature, providing novel ways to make sense of key concepts in the discipline. I discuss three central issues around which anthropophagy contributes to contemporary theory, those of otherness, authenticity, and corporality.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30616924,

It has been observed that in adopting nation-building as the main path towards liberation, political class in the post-colonies created new minorities, marginalized non-dominant social groups, and further entrenched the political order of the nation-state throughout the world. Moreover, with capitalist mode of production now assuming a truly global dominance, there is not yet any commensurate political and legal institution to contain the economic consequences. Hence, thinking and acting beyond nationalism, whether in forms of regionalism, cosmopolitanism, or internationalism, has been central to postcolonial studies. This chapter offers an overview of the debate on nationalism in postcolonial studies. It suggests that the common practice of pitting nationalism against cosmopolitanism obscures the humanist vision implied in both concepts and there is a need to refocus public discourse on the thematic of humanism. Finally, the chapter makes a case for promoting hybridity to change the political status quo and suggests that we see hybridity not as exclusively a postmodern condition but as coextensive with nationalism in modernity and construct a robust counterculture around it.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8417032, "first_name": "Nick", "last_name": "Lu", "domain_name": "selu", "page_name": "NickLu", "display_name": "Nick T .

If in the past hybrid carried with it negative connotations due to the presence of heterogeneous elements considered ill-matched and lacking in harmony, today hybrid has taken on a neutral value and indicates the existence of two or more models that intersect, contaminating and appropriating different discourses and levels of writing, reworking them. Each element, be it a complete text or a fragment of language, must be considered in its capacity to entertain relations with other elements: Bakhtin reminds us that literary language is a linguistic hybrid (cf. Aesthetics and the Novel, 1975). The question of heterogeneity is thus read in terms of a creation on multiple levels that requires a multidisciplinary vision, and that crosses genres that are different from each other: literature hybridises with cinema and vice versa, painting contaminates music... Hybridity removes the barriers between genres; time and space become porous elements that intersect, and this process of hybridisation gives rise to new products capable of incorporating different techniques, contents and styles-hybrids! In the television sector, these hybrids can be seen more strongly, such as docufiction, infotainment, but also narrative reportage, with its hybrids between literature and journalistic reporting (from Goethe to Truman Capote to Tiziano Terzani). There are also less apparent hybrids, such as the one proposed in the 1930s by Massimo Bontempelli, whose 522. Romanzo di una giornata (1932) is an example of hybridisation between literature and advertising. The technology push seems to have accelerated the possibilities of hybridisation, and the very concept of hybridisation is becoming a key to examining objects and practices and reflecting on the principles of categorisation (cf. Jean-Jacques W\u00fcnenberger, \"Pratiques artistiques post-modernes et hybridit\u00e9\" in L. Gwiazdzinski, L'hybridation des mondes.

The theme of 'hybridity' tackles questions of cultural identity and identity politics, particularly when the musical performances in diaspora and imposed self-exile voice political struggles in the homeland, and manifest the musicians' national consciousness. Highlighting political aesthetics and ideologies of transnationalism, the present research examines the musical performances of two Arab bands in Western diaspora. The first is '47Soul', a London-based band of Palestinian origins that fuses the music folklore of the Levant, with electronic sonic systems, in musical hybrids negotiating the Palestinian musical identity. The second is 'Nas Jota,' a Sudanese music group and production platform based in the United States of America. Nas Jota produces Arabic hip-hop performances, mixed with African reggae, employing heteroglossic linguistic variations, to articulate political protest against the autocracy of Sudan's former regime. The paper aims to illustrate the transcultural exchange of musical and lyrical features reflective of the musical hybrids and hybrid identities emerging in light of the diasporic and exilic experiences. The paper places the musical hybrids in the cultural and political contexts of their composition and reception. Offering an interdisciplinary approach, the paper argues that the hybrid identities of these young Arab musicians is represented in the hybridity of the musical fusions. In addition, the engagement of the musical hybrids with national popular struggles in the homeland sheds light on national identity ties.\n\nhttps://journals.ekb.eg/article_160208.html", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 77878504, "asset_id": 61243575, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4098709, "first_name": "Rowa", "last_name": "Nabil", "domain_name": "cairo", "page_name": "RowaNabil", "display_name": "Rowa Nabil", "profile_url": "https://cairo.academia.edu/RowaNabil?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4098709/1580969/36350732/s65_rowa.nabil.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1631, "name": "Popular Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Music?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2858, "name": "Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Culture?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5815, "name": "Identity politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_politics?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 12788, "name": "Political aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_aesthetics?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 101917, "name": "Popular Music and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Music_and_Culture?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 150094, "name": "Fusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fusion?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 163928, "name": "Musical Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Musical_Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 257799, "name": "Artivism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Artivism?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 59324494, "title": "A Revolution in Fragments: Traversing Scales of Justice, Ideology, and Practice in Bolivia by Mark Goodale (review)", "created_at": "2021-10-21T08:57:44.068-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/59324494/A_Revolution_in_Fragments_Traversing_Scales_of_Justice_Ideology_and_Practice_in_Bolivia_by_Mark_Goodale_review_?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_59324494", "summary": "A Revolution in Fragments offers a rich and detailed political and legal history of revolution by constitution, and the juridification of a pro-indigenous reform agenda through creative practices of legal reasoning and bureaucratic refashioning. In illuminating growing disaffection with Morales by some of his earliest and strongest supporters, the book also supplies a retrospective account of the drawn-out fall from grace of Morales\u2019 nationalist decolonial project. Beyond this institutional history, however, the book also offers a touching portrait of the ethical uncertainties of juridification as a technology for political change. Recalling Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui\u2019s (2012) discussion of decolonial sensibilities that are irreducible to revivalist terms, the book raises the crucial question of the continued vitality of decolonial projects that are, and never were, contained fully within Morales\u2019 program. This question bears restating given President Luis Arce\u2019s election in 2020. It suggests an alternative to the idea that in its hegemonic refashioning, indigeneity gets subsumed into coloniality (Burman 2020). In Bolivia as elsewhere, revolution\u2014as an orientation to history and as a set of multi-faceted political projects\u2014never belongs to the state alone.

The reality is that partnerships across racial, cultural or religious lines have historically been problematized around the world. Laws prohibiting mixed unions were present in countless nations until very recently. This preoccupation with intermarriage is why it has been a leitmotiv in literature over the centuries and later on in cinema, from Shakespeare\u2019s Othello and Romeo and Juliet, to Stanley Kramer\u2019s Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner. This chapter will provide a historical and anthropological analysis of state control over partnership formation, offering a number of cases around the world where nations have implemented anti-mixing laws. In these contexts, miscegenation (the mixing of people through marriage who were considered to be of different racial groups) was abhorred and treated as a deviance, as devoid of love, and, above all, as a threat to national integrity and the status quo. This exploration can help us to better understand the social, cultural, and political contexts in which restrictive views of coupling, family, and love have emerged, and to critically reflect on continued prejudices towards mixed unions that still exist in current times.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65230815, "asset_id": 44744274, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 67225514, "asset_id": 44744274, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 249183, "first_name": "Dan", "last_name": "Rodr\u00edguez-Garc\u00eda", "domain_name": "uab", "page_name": "DanRodriguezGarcia", "display_name": "Dan Rodr\u00edguez-Garc\u00eda", "profile_url": "https://uab.academia.edu/DanRodriguezGarcia?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/249183/354638/424959/s65_dan.rodr_guez-garc_a.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6245, "name": "Stereotypes and Prejudice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stereotypes_and_Prejudice?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6942, "name": "Discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Discrimination?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10006, "name": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_and_Racial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10187, "name": "Love", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Love?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 27879, "name": "Racial and ethnic discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_and_ethnic_discrimination?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 59958, "name": "Intermarriages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intermarriages?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 72563, "name": "Miscegenation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Miscegenation?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 135047, "name": "Social Exclusion and Inclusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Exclusion_and_Inclusion?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 167746, "name": "Cultural and Social Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_and_Social_Anthropology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 291481, "name": "Anthropology of Love", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Love?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 876551, "name": "Social Exclusion and Social Inequalities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Exclusion_and_Social_Inequalities?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1421381, "name": "Historical Antropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Antropology?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 44737671, "title": "The Images of 'In-between' in Derek Walcott's Poetry", "created_at": "2020-12-19T05:53:34.150-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44737671/The_Images_of_In_between_in_Derek_Walcotts_Poetry?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_44737671", "summary": "Derek Walcott, by using in-between images like 'twilight', and 'beach' in his poetry, establishes his position as 'something besides,' which is more than his hybrid position of 'neither the one nor the other,' to locate his split state of being.

The second part explores ways that the logic and aesthetics of the grotesque body and other carnivalesque modes such as ambivalent laughter and practice utopias extend beyond Carnival to shape the broader politics of Catalan civic life.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64230310, "asset_id": 43906372, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 158614, "first_name": "Brad", "last_name": "Erickson", "domain_name": "sfsu", "page_name": "BradErickson", "display_name": "Brad Erickson", "profile_url": "https://sfsu.academia.edu/BradErickson?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/158614/40850/3685707/s65_brad.erickson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7220, "name": "The Grotesque Body", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Grotesque_Body?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14157, "name": "The Carnivalesque", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Carnivalesque?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50019, "name": "Mikhail Bakhtin", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mikhail_Bakhtin?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 50982, "name": "Conviviality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conviviality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 149466, "name": "Visuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visuality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1226885, "name": "Critical Utopia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Utopia?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 43676766, "title": "Flamenco as Palimpsest: Reading through Hybridity", "created_at": "2020-07-21T01:56:52.147-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43676766/Flamenco_as_Palimpsest_Reading_through_Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_43676766", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63979075, "asset_id": 43676766, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 516010, "first_name": "Samuel", "last_name": "Llano", "domain_name": "manchester", "page_name": "SamuelLlano", "display_name": "Samuel Llano", "profile_url": "https://manchester.academia.edu/SamuelLlano?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/516010/180562/14887246/s65_samuel.llano.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 136, "name": "Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1631, "name": "Popular Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Music?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 6880, "name": "Spanish History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spanish_History?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 10871, "name": "Regionalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Regionalism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 47389, "name": "Flamenco", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Flamenco?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 80173, "name": "Spanish Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spanish_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 41290403, "title": "DOMINASI, HIBRIDITAS, DAN RESISTENSI  DALAM TRILOGI GADIS TANGSI KARYA SUPARTO BRATA (PRESPEKTIF POSKOLONIAL)", "created_at": "2019-12-13T16:02:35.765-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41290403/DOMINASI_HIBRIDITAS_DAN_RESISTENSI_DALAM_TRILOGI_GADIS_TANGSI_KARYA_SUPARTO_BRATA_PRESPEKTIF_POSKOLONIAL_?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_41290403", "summary": "Trilogi Gadis Tangsi karya Suparto Brata mengandung sisi kesejarahan yang unik, karena berada pada setting masa akhir pemerintahan kolonial Belanda, masuknya penjajah Jepang, serta saat mulai tumbuhnya semangat nasionalisme pribumi. Saat-saat tersebut adalah keadaan masyarakat terjajah sudah mengalami masa ketertindasan yang lama. Budaya penjajah telah lebih dari 300 tahun bergesekan dengan budaya lokal. Dominasi kuasa Belanda telah sangat kuat, dan masuk dalam berbagai lini kehidupan masyarakat Jawa. Rekaman sejarah yang terkandung dalam novel ini menyuguhkan berbagai probelmatika sosial budaya antara terjajah dan penjajah.\nMengacu pada masalah dominasi ideologis penjajahan, serta bentukan kondisi poskolonial yang dialami masyarakat terjajah, penelitian ini berfokus pada dekonstruksi diskursus kolonialisme pada masyarakat poskolonial, melalui kritik karya sastra. Fokus utamanya adalah menguraikan bentuk dominasi, hibriditas, dan resistensi yang ada dalam novel.\nTujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengkaji bentukan ideologi kolonialisme yang terbangun dalam novel. Analisis mendalam pada bentuk dominasi penjajah akan dapat mengungkapkan unsur ideologi orientalisme pada pola-pola dominasi penjajah. Kondisi ambivalen masyarakat Jawa antara memilih budaya sendiri atau budaya penjajah dapat diuraikan dengan mendalam melalui analisis hibriditas. Respon masyarakat terjajah pada dominasi penjajah, dapat dijelaskan secara mendalam melalui analisis bentuk resistensi mereka. \nJenis penelitian yang digunakan adalah penelitian kualitatif dengan melakukan analisis isi pada trilogi GT. Analisis isi bertujuan untuk membongkar dan mengkonfigurasi data-data yang ada dalam novel, serta melakukan kritik poskolonial terhadap data-data yang dihasilkan. Dengan usaha tersebut, bentuk dominasi ideologi kolonialisme terhadap terjajah, hibriditas gaya hidup terjajah, serta bentuk resistensi terkoloni, dapat diungkapkan dengan baik. \nHasil penelitian dari analisis data menunjukkan bahwa bentuk dominasi penjajah kepada terjajah muncul dalam berbagai praktik; 1) Stereotype kepada terjajah. 2) Menganggap terjajah sebagai the other. 3) Menganggap terjajah adalah masyarakat subaltern. 4) Penjajah tampil secara superior dalam bidang; a) ilmu pengetahuan, b) kesusastraan, c) kewibawaan. 5) Penjajah melakukan agitasi pada wilayah terjajah. 6) Penjajah memberikan previlese ekonomi pada non pribumi, 7) Secara sosial, posisi wong cilik berada pada level paling bawah. Mereka absah untuk diperlakukan secara diskriminatif oleh penjajah. 8) Dominasi juga berdampak pada masalah psikologis yang meliputi; a) syndrome inferiority complex, b) keterpesonaan pada penjajah, c) kecemburuan pada kekayaan penjajah, dan, d) gangguan jiwa karena represifitas penjajah. Bentuk hibriditas dalam trilogi GT meliputi dua hal yakni; 1) Penggunaan bahasa penjajah sebagai simbol prestise dan peningkatan kelas. 2) Penggunaan mode pakaian penjajah sebagai simbol prestise dan peningkatan kelas masyarakat Eropa (Europese Enclave). Bentuk resistensi dalam trilogi GT terlihat dalam hal berikut; 1) Tetap menggunakan atribut Jawa dalam konteks budaya Eropa. 2) Budaya dan pendidikan penjajah digunakan sebagai alat untuk memahami kedirian bangsa dan memupuk nasionalisme.\n\nKata kunci: \tposkolonialisme, orientalisme, kolonialisme, dominasi, hibriditas, mimikri, resistensi, representasi", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61508013, "asset_id": 41290403, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3538244, "first_name": "Hizbulloh", "last_name": "Huda", "domain_name": "unesa", "page_name": "HizbullohHuda", "display_name": "Hizbulloh  Huda", "profile_url": "https://unesa.academia.edu/HizbullohHuda?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3538244/2550104/2960577/s65_hizbulloh.huda.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10444, "name": "Postmodernism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postmodernism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 41289895, "title": "Hybridit\u00e9 artistique et hybridit\u00e9 identitaire dans Tels des astres \u00e9teints (2008) de L\u00e9onora Miano", "created_at": "2019-12-13T15:10:16.127-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41289895/Hybridit%C3%A9_artistique_et_hybridit%C3%A9_identitaire_dans_Tels_des_astres_%C3%A9teints_2008_de_L%C3%A9onora_Miano?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_41289895", "summary": "If there is an aesthetic that characterizes the novel Tels des astres \u00e9teints writing by Leonora Miano, it is the combination of literary art and the art of music.

In the modern world the transformation of multiculturalism and globalism towards transculture is an inevitable consequence of the complicated processes of cultural interaction in all countries of the world. Transculturalism is an alternative to multiculturalism as a product of globalism and has different rhetoric of the Other. \r\nThe transcultural concept, put forward by F. Ortiz as an alternative to the asymmetric concept of acculturation in the area of cultural contacts, provided opportunities for describing the complex processes of cultural interaction in the era of globalization. Transculture is based on the cultural polyphony, in which there should not be a complete synthesis, where the cultures retain some opacity. The concept of transculturality can be used as a basis for a modern comparative analysis of literature. \r\nAt the same time, key issues of interaction of cultures in post-Soviet discourse are not solved. Therefore, the study of methodologies of post-Soviet studies is important not only as theoretical problem, but also as a problem of general cultural significance. Therefore, the Caribbean philosophy, which is being built as a significant element of contemporary comparativism in the field of interaction between cultures, directly concerns the problems of choosing ways of further postcolonial development of post-Soviet cultures. Transculturalism proposes the principle of hybridity instead of the archaic principle of the purity of national culture, declaring the change in attitude to national languages, cultural traditions and the very concept of nation-state, giving way to the processes of transnationalization and polyglossia associated with the principle of  the networked cosmopolitanism. This is a new relationship between languages and cultures. Ultimately, this new andmagological interaction between the Own and the Other. It is a search for a new unity of the various Others. \r\nKey words: comparative literature, postcolonial studies, transculturalism, hybridization, multiculturalism, globalism, post-Soviet studies, cultural identity.\r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61388236, "asset_id": 41140492, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10373781,

By looking closely at these phenomena of hybridization, which challenge traditional, art-historical labeling, such as \u201cByzantine\u201d versus \u201cGothic\u201d, \u201cEastern\u201d versus \u201cWestern\u201d, or \u201cOrthodox\u201d versus \u201cCatholic\u201d, the present paper seeks to illustrate the fluctuation of confessional and artistic borders in the field of religious art in Transylvania.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the southern and south-western areas of the Voivodat of Transylvania and Kingdom of Hungary, respectively, represented a border region where several ethnic and confessional groups coexisted, each of them bringing into play its own cultural and religious tradition. Under Latin/Catholic rule, Orthodox Romanians (Vlachs) lived together with Catholic Hungarians, Szeklers, and Saxons, their long-lasting conviventia generating frequent encounters with the culture of the Other, which left deep traces in the religious art of both confessional groups. \nGiven the multicultural and bi-confessional specificity of the region, it is not surprising that one can find a significant number of cases when painters of Byzantine tradition worked for Catholic commissioners. Except for their occasional preference for painters displaying Byzantinizing features in their manner (e.g., mural ensembles such as those in Bune\u015fti or \u015ei\u015fterea), Catholic patrons entrusted sometimes painters of Byzantine tradition with the decoration of their Gothic churches (e.g., the workshop active in D\u00e2rlos and \u015emig; another workshop commissioned to work in T\u00e2rgu Mure\u015f and Valea Lung\u0103; or the atelier active in S\u00e2nt\u0103m\u0103ria-Orlea). Whenever painters of Byzantine tradition worked for Catholic commissioners, the artists had to permanently adapt their iconographic and stylistic vocabulary, in order to respond to the requirements of the particular worship space they decorated or to their commissioners\u2019 devotional sensibility and demands. \nThese artists proved to be highly receptive to themes and motifs typical for Western/Catholic art and tended either to imitate the Western iconographic solutions or to develop Catholic-like iconographies on the basis of familiar Orthodox iconographic schemes. A striking illustration of the first strategy is the isolated scene of the Finding of the Holy Cross by St. Helena inserted in the Catholic church in S\u00e2nt\u0103m\u0103ria-Orlea into an ensemble consisting of themes otherwise usual for Byzantine iconography. This episode which itself appears very rarely in Byzantine art, but is popular in Western iconography, seems to be fully influenced by Catholic devotional norms, as the depiction of the Holy Empress\u2019 figure next to the oversized relics of the Cross replaces here the usual Orthodox Exaltation of the Holy Cross.\nThe second adaptation pattern can be illustrated by the iconographic program of the sanctuary in D\u00e2rlos which is composite in its nature and neither entirely Byzantine, nor entirely Catholic. Relying on the customary compositional patterns and devices, the workshop\u2019s two painters were faced with the double challenge posed by the specific demands of their Catholic commissioners and by the architectural peculiarities of the Gothic polygonal sanctuary. Consequently, they developed an iconographic program consisting of the Last Judgment, St. Catherine\u2019s life cycle, parables, and isolated figures of saints, which turned the sanctuary murals into a curious hybrid (both in its style and iconography), which is atypical for both Orthodox and Catholic traditions.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58851221, "asset_id": 38762682, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 725693, "first_name": "Dragos Gh.", "last_name": "Nastasoiu", "domain_name": "nec-ro", "page_name": "DragosGhNastasoiu", "display_name": "Dragos Gh.

The Analysis is focused on the report of John Floyer, an English physician and writer, (1699) that contains a summary of views on essence of monstrosity and causes of monstrous births featuring the learned and popular circles of that time. Floyer\u2019s convictions and line of reasoning are considered in the context of biological discov-eries in the later part of the 17th c., natural philosophic theories connected with them, and tenets of the Renaissance monstrology. It allows of exposing innovative as well as traditional aspects proper to Floyer\u2019s set of ideas and the discussed situation on the whole. It is found out that the innovative moment comprised explanation of monstrosity in embryogenetic terms and incremental discrediting of a notion that sexual intercourse between humans and animals can bring about hybrid creatures.

The novel, season of migration to the north, is the most famous postcolonial Arabic novel which has caught the attention of so many literary critics including Edward Sa\u2019eed, the Palestinian-American literary theoretician, and even in 2001, the academy of Arabic literature in Damascus named it as the best Arabic novel in the twentieth century. \nA noticeable part of this research has been allocated to analysis of postcolonial concepts of the novel such as ego/other (core/periphery), hybridity, eurocentrism, and gender. It is worth noting that analysis of ego/other (core/periphery), in addition to text of the novel, includes some paratext elements like title and cover design.  The primary outcome achieved from this composition is that the novel Season of Migration to the North, projecting a vivid objective image of economical and sociological position of Sudan and its intellectuals\u2019 crisis in postcolonial period gained an elevated status among other similar Arabic novels.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57901901, "asset_id": 37893301, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 96738087, "first_name": "Journal of", "last_name": "Arabic Literature", "domain_name": "tehran", "page_name": "JournalofArabicLiterature", "display_name": "Journal of Arabic Literature", "profile_url": "https://tehran.academia.edu/JournalofArabicLiterature?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/96738087/21177846/20633583/s65_journal_of.arabic_literatur.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 59796, "name": "Postcolonial Criticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Criticism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 595472, "name": "Season of Migration to the North", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Season_of_Migration_to_the_North?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3073894, "name": "\u0627\u0631\u0648\u067e\u0627 \u0645\u062d\u0648\u0631\u06cc\t", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%BE%D8%A7_%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%B1%DB%8C?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3073895, "name": "\u062f\u0648\u0631\u06af\u0647 \u200c\u0628\u0648\u062f\u06af\u06cc", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%B1%DA%AF%D9%87_%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%AF%DA%AF%DB%8C?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3073896, "name": "\u0646\u0642\u062f \u067e\u0633\u0627\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0631\u06cc", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/%D9%86%D9%82%D8%AF_%D9%BE%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3073897, "name": " \u0645\u0648\u0633\u0645 \u0647\u062c\u0631\u062a \u0628\u0647 \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644 (\u0645\u0648\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u062c\u0631\u0647 \u0625\u0644\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%85_%D9%87%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%AA_%D8%A8%D9%87_%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84_%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%85_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87%D8%AC%D8%B1%D9%87_%D8%A5%D9%84%DB%8C_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3073898, "name": "\u0645\u0646/ \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631\u06cc", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/%D9%85%D9%86_%D8%AF%DB%8C%DA%AF%D8%B1%DB%8C?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 3073899, "name": "ego/other (core/periphery)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ego_other_core_periphery_?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 37863395, "title": "Grace Aguilar on the Law of the Jealous Man (Numbers 5:11-31): A Nineteenth-Century Engagement with England's 'Others'", "created_at": "2018-11-27T12:58:38.377-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37863395/Grace_Aguilar_on_the_Law_of_the_Jealous_Man_Numbers_5_11_31_A_Nineteenth_Century_Engagement_with_Englands_Others?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_37863395", "summary": "This paper was delivered in the Recovering Female Interpreters of the Bible Section at the 2018 national meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature/American Academy of Religion in Denver, Colorado, USA.\n\nThe paper reads Grace Aguilar\u2019s exposition of the law of the jealous man in Numbers 5:11-31in her 1851 biography of biblical women, The Women of Israel against the backdrop of Anglo-imperialism\u2019s nineteenth-century constructions of the \u2018other.\u2019 It argues that the author\u2019s view to the ancient Israelites, despite being a defense of Israelite jurisprudence, accords with the hegemonic norms of the time in finding an essential(ized) difference between East and West. The disagreeable bits to the law are the traces of Israel\u2019s backward Near Eastern heritage. In this way, the interpretation of the law charts a progressive path to English cultural, moral, and aesthetic supremacy in its mapping of the ancient Mediterranean mind. yet, Aguilar is ambivalent in this project. As a member of the Sephardic Jewish minority on the fringes of English society, she cannot embrace completely Anglo-imperialism\u2019s norms for engaging the \u2018other.\u2019 In pressing for a reading of the rule as a reasonable and compassionate containment of Eastern \u2018passion\u2019 with its violent proclivities, Aguilar shuttles between sympathy for Israel and distance as an occidental observer and critic.

In the southeastern Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, persistent droughts punctuated by devastating floods have already wrecked local agricultural economies, pushed thousands of rural residents towards the cities, and devastated numerous ecosystems. For government environmental analysts struggling to set climate change on the state\u2019s list of priorities, disaster management has been one of the most successful means of grabbing attention. In particular, the framework of Ecosystem-Based Disaster Risk Reduction, or Eco-DRR, the use of \u201cnatural\u201d ecological processes to prevent, mitigate, and repair damage, has allowed environmental agencies to make their concerns a priority.\n\nBuilding on ethnographic fieldwork in Minas Gerais with state environmental analysts developing Eco-DRR projects, this presentation explores the conceptual and rhetorical deployment of Eco-DRR and the stakes of framing climate change disasters. How does posing climate change as a punctuated period of natural disasters that must be addressed through Eco-DRR rework thinking about ecological processes and the rhythm of environmental politics? While treating Eco-DRR as a hybrid of nature and culture could demonstrate that \u201cnatural\u201d disasters are rarely, if ever, wholly \u201cnatural\u201d and that Eco-DRR is yet another blurred boundary, this presentation will attempt to make Eco-DRR \u201cvisible as a singularity.\u201d (Foucault 2000, 226). That is, how does Eco-DRR offer new glimpses into forms of government and nature emerging today?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57761653, "asset_id": 37766082, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2781364, "first_name": "Jonathan", "last_name": "Wald", "domain_name": "mcgill", "page_name": "JonathanWald", "display_name": "Jonathan Wald", "profile_url": "https://mcgill.academia.edu/JonathanWald?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2781364/907893/23408846/s65_jonathan.wald.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1512, "name": "Climate Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9787, "name": "Environmental Policy and Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Policy_and_Governance?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9821, "name": "Brazil", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brazil?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 31018, "name": "Institutional Ethnography (Research Methodology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Institutional_Ethnography_Research_Methodology_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 42234, "name": "Natural Disasters", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Natural_Disasters?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 78388, "name": "Bureaucracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bureaucracy?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 81856, "name": "Ecosystem Restoration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecosystem_Restoration?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 124602, "name": "Minas Gerais", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minas_Gerais?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1383418, "name": "Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecosystem-based_Disaster_Risk_Reduction?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1744493, "name": "Science and Technology Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_and_Technology_Studies?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 37461899, "title": "\u011f Queer Forms Migrate", "created_at": "2018-09-23T00:17:04.547-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37461899/%C4%9F_Queer_Forms_Migrate?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_37461899", "summary": "Schwules Museum Berlin hosted a group exhibition called \u011f -

By studying the changing relationship between the neighborhood\u2019s built environment, the racialization of Tunisian migrants and the town\u2019s transitioning economy, it analyzes transformations of the Casbah from a working-class Sicilian neighborhood, to an \u2018insanitary\u2019 Tunisian ghetto, to a showcase of the town\u2019s Mediterranean multiculturalism. Through this analysis, the article makes three arguments. Firstly, by showing that \u2018ethnic packaging\u2019 does not always lead to gentrification but may engender other types of conflict, it argues that the \u2018marketization\u2019 of urban diversity has a variety of consequences tied to cities\u2019 positions in broader geographies of uneven development. Secondly, by showing that the changing racialization of Tunisian migrants was produced both through changes to Mazara\u2019s built environment and through shifting territorial relations within Italy and across the Mediterranean, it develops a multi-scalar analysis of racialization. Thirdly, by showing that Sicilian depictions of Tunisian migrants changed according to shifting understandings of Sicilian modernity vis-\u00e0-vis the north of Italy, it argues that Italian immigration discourses develop in relation to internal forms of \u2018othering\u2019 of southern Italians.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56543321, "asset_id": 34968461, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1760959, "first_name": "Ilaria", "last_name": "Giglioli", "domain_name": "usfca", "page_name": "IlariaGiglioli", "display_name": "Ilaria Giglioli", "profile_url": "https://usfca.academia.edu/IlariaGiglioli?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1760959/3014129/20026609/s65_ilaria.giglioli.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 383, "name": "European Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/European_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7455, "name": "Gentrification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gentrification?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 12047, "name": "Regional development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Regional_development?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 45213, "name": "Italy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Italy?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 75837, "name": "Tunisia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tunisia?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 249304, "name": "Borders and Borderlands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borders_and_Borderlands?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 36848419, "title": "FPGA IMPLEMENTATION OF SOFT OUTPUT VITERBI ALGORITHM USING MEMORYLESS HYBRID REGISTER EXCHANGE METHOD", "created_at": "2018-06-15T04:07:29.692-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36848419/FPGA_IMPLEMENTATION_OF_SOFT_OUTPUT_VITERBI_ALGORITHM_USING_MEMORYLESS_HYBRID_REGISTER_EXCHANGE_METHOD?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_36848419", "summary": "The importance of convolutional codes is well established.

Both introduced and extinct: The fallow deer of Roman Mallorca. Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports 9, 168-177.\r\n\r\nThe archaeological record concerning the distribution and timing of fallow deer translocation across the Mediter-ranean has been growing in the last years. This knowledge has provided important insights into the movement, trade patterns and ideology of past societies. Unfortunately, the dispersal of fallow deer to the western part of the Mediterranean is insufficiently understood. To fill this gap, this article presents the results of a multidisciplinary investigation (combining the zooarchaeological evidence with AMS radiocarbon dating, isotope analyses and preliminary aDNA results) from a set of remains recovered from archaeological sites on Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Western Mediterranean). The purpose is to explore the timing, circumstances and meaning of the fallow deer's introduction to this island, as well as their subsequent management and extirpation. The results of these proxies confirm the arrival of the fallow deer during the Roman period and, after a short expansion with the establishment of vivaria, its disappearance after the Byzantine period.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54399631, "asset_id": 34533539, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 649778, "first_name": "Richard", "last_name": "Madgwick", "domain_name": "cardiff", "page_name": "RichardMadgwick", "display_name": "Richard Madgwick", "profile_url": "https://cardiff.academia.edu/RichardMadgwick?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/649778/224538/262676/s65_richard.madgwick.jpg"}, {"id": 82618, "first_name": "Karis", "last_name": "Baker", "domain_name": "durham", "page_name": "karisbaker", "display_name": "Karis Baker", "profile_url": "https://durham.academia.edu/karisbaker?f_ri=4138", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 484130, "first_name": "Jane", "last_name": "Evans", "domain_name": "bgs", "page_name": "JaneEvans", "display_name": "Jane Evans", "profile_url": "https://bgs.academia.edu/JaneEvans?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/484130/188005/219140/s65_jane.evans.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 393, "name": "Classical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Classical_Archaeology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1624, "name": "Zooarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zooarchaeology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1703, "name": "Stable Isotope Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stable_Isotope_Analysis?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7941, "name": "Stable Isotopes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stable_Isotopes?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 21967, "name": "Ancient DNA (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_DNA_Archaeology_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 25382, "name": "Baleares /Balearic Islands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Baleares_Balearic_Islands?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 25712, "name": "Ancient DNA Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_DNA_Research?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 31729, "name": "Ritual Zooarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ritual_Zooarchaeology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 32780, "name": "Mediterranean archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mediterranean_archaeology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 34480, "name": "14C dating (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/14C_dating_Archaeology_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 47094, "name": "Faunal Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Faunal_Analysis?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 64938, "name": "Fallow deer", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fallow_deer?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 77544, "name": "Cervidae", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cervidae?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 452785, "name": "Balearic Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Balearic_Archaeology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 634974, "name": "Roman Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Roman_Archaeology?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 34371078, "title": "\u201e\u00dajrasz\u00fclt\u00e9k a Megv\u00e1lt\u00f3t\" \u2013 A Messi\u00e1s-mot\u00edvum mint kultur\u00e1lis hibridit\u00e1s Borb\u00e9ly Szil\u00e1rd m\u0171veiben", "created_at": "2017-08-27T12:58:41.462-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34371078/_%C3%9Ajrasz%C3%BClt%C3%A9k_a_Megv%C3%A1lt%C3%B3t_A_Messi%C3%A1s_mot%C3%ADvum_mint_kultur%C3%A1lis_hibridit%C3%A1s_Borb%C3%A9ly_Szil%C3%A1rd_m%C5%B1veiben?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_34371078", "summary": "Sz\u00e1z P\u00e1l kurzusa a Pesti B\u00f6lcs\u00e9sz Akad\u00e9mi\u00e1n:\n \nKult\u00farak\u00f6zis\u00e9g \u00e9s hibridit\u00e1s Borb\u00e9ly Szil\u00e1rd m\u0171veiben\n \nAz el\u0151ad\u00e1s-sorozat Borb\u00e9ly Szil\u00e1rd azon m\u0171veit vizsg\u00e1lja, melyekben a zsid\u00f3 \u00e9s kereszt\u00e9ny (sz\u00f6veg)hagyom\u00e1nyok elemei saj\u00e1tos m\u00f3don \u00f6tv\u00f6z\u0151dnek.

Each of EBBJ\u2019s threads is situated in relation to hybridity, intersectionality, bilingualism, translanguaging, transnationalism, and the border itself.

While outbound mobility programs can build students' intercultural competence, this does not happen just because they study abroad. This chapter presents a new border pedagogy based on the concept of hybridity that is being used to transform an Australian outbound mobility program. The new border pedagogy works by intentionally putting what is 'known' into crisis by constantly blurring and problematising boundaries, binaries and identities. Outbound mobility programs that leverage a new border pedagogy underpinned by hybridity can build students' intercultural competence by encouraging them to embrace potential miscommunication and intercultural conflict.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49021756, "asset_id": 28649787, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 170387, "first_name": "Chris", "last_name": "Walsh", "domain_name": "vu", "page_name": "ChrisWalsh", "display_name": "Chris Walsh", "profile_url": "https://vu.academia.edu/ChrisWalsh?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/170387/42849/18227853/s65_chris.walsh.jpg"}, {"id": 8406894, "first_name": "Louise", "last_name": "Townsin", "domain_name": "tua-au", "page_name": "LouiseTownsin", "display_name": "Louise  Townsin", "profile_url": "https://tua-au.academia.edu/LouiseTownsin?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8406894/5959243/6764290/s65_louise.townsin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3392, "name": "Critical Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Pedagogy?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3810, "name": "Mindfulness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mindfulness?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 9491, "name": "Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pedagogy?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 11313, "name": "Border Crossing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Border_Crossing?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 16997, "name": "Globalization And Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization_And_Higher_Education?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 23791, "name": "Third Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Third_Space?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 33323, "name": "Intercultural Competence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intercultural_Competence?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 46400, "name": "Student Mobility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_Mobility?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 59813, "name": "Coloniality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coloniality?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 73676, "name": "Cultural Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Globalization?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 76042, "name": "Mindfulness and well being", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mindfulness_and_well_being?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 106080, "name": "International student mobility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_student_mobility?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 110077, "name": "Mindfulness in Effective Teaching and Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mindfulness_in_Effective_Teaching_and_Learning?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 118391, "name": "Intercultral Communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intercultral_Communication?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 26992979, "title": "Frances Slaney and Anna Williams: Wild", "created_at": "2016-07-14T14:13:58.144-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26992979/Frances_Slaney_and_Anna_Williams_Wild?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_26992979", "summary": "This essay was written for an exhibition at RIA, Research in Art in Ottawa, which is a home-based contemporary art initiative. \n Ursa and Iris, the frolicking dogs in Frances Slaney\u2019s photo cut-outs and the She-Wolves in Anna Williams\u2019 sculptures and drawings of pairing female human/wolf creatures, are engaged in moments that appear fierce, even wild. \nIn this essay, I explore the idea of 'wild' with Thoreau, to indicate something that is within us, as it is within the world.

Confronting me with my animality, the creatures represented here provoke a deep sense of connection between human and non-human.

Teaching identities can be created from knowledge gained from university professors and from cooperating teachers in school. Therefore, it is very important to develop a program which can enhance teaching identities of student teachers. The purpose of this research was to develop a teaching practicum program for elementary education pre-service teachers based on hybridity theory and the third space concept. There were 10 student teachers majoring in elementary education in Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand, participating in this experiment. The sample group was selected using purposive sampling. Professors and cooperating teachers also participated in the training program developed based on the third space concept. Data were collected through participant observation and evaluated by the researcher, professors, and cooperating teachers. It is found that student teachers participated in this program created their teaching identities after all.

L1 writing teachers argue that writers need to be aware of the belief systems that guide their word choices. However, most writers' handbooks promote correct, clear, and cohesive prose over analogical comparisons. The increased conceptual capacity of bilinguals who experience a hybrid of two cultural and linguistic filters of life is shut out of L1-based writing curriculums that focus mainly on correctness and clarity. But how liberating can consciously chosen metaphorical blends be for multilingual writers? This case study compares one Vietnamese-American writer's unconscious application of conceptual metaphor with her consciously chosen metaphorical blend. This analysis finds that Violet's creative metaphoric blend portrayed a hybrid conceptual space in which traditional Vietnamese and mainstream American cultural values interacted, whereas the unconscious conceptual metaphors that she employed cast these value sets as irreconcilably separate. Violet's creative hybrid space allows her to imagine reconciliation and potential combinations of selected values rather than wholesale subscriptions to cultural norms.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45416518, "asset_id": 25094122, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3135193, "first_name": "Josephine", "last_name": "Kelso", "domain_name": "ohlone", "page_name": "JosephineKelso", "display_name": "Josephine Kelso", "profile_url": "https://ohlone.academia.edu/JosephineKelso?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3135193/1030596/1287736/s65_josephine.kelso.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 976, "name": "Composition and Rhetoric", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Composition_and_Rhetoric?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5460, "name": "Conceptual Metaphor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conceptual_Metaphor?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11712, "name": "Metaphor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Metaphor?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21934, "name": "Multilingual Writers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingual_Writers?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 766032, "name": "Symbolic Competence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Symbolic_Competence?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 14895908, "title": "The Lebanese Diaspora: The Arab Immigrant Experience in Montreal, New York and Paris", "created_at": "2015-08-13T04:25:24.780-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14895908/The_Lebanese_Diaspora_The_Arab_Immigrant_Experience_in_Montreal_New_York_and_Paris?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_14895908", "summary": "The Lebanese are the largest group of Middle Eastern immigrants in the United States, and Lebanese immigrants are also prominent across Europe and the Americas. Based on over eighty interviews with first-generation Lebanese immigrants in the global cities of New York, Montreal and Paris, this book shows that the Lebanese diaspora \u2013 like all diasporas \u2013 constructs global relations connecting and transforming their new societies, previous homeland and world-wide communities. Taking Lebanese immigrants\u2019 forms of identification, community attachments and cultural expression as manifestations of diaspora experiences, Dalia Abdelhady delves into the ways members of Lebanese diasporic communities move beyond nationality, ethnicity and religion, giving rise to global solidarities and negotiating their social and cultural spaces.\n\nThe Lebanese Diaspora explores new forms of identities, alliances and cultural expressions, elucidating the daily experiences of Lebanese immigrants and exploring new ways of thinking about immigration, ethnic identity, community, and culture in a global world. By criticizing and challenging our understandings of nationality, ethnicity and assimilation, Abdelhady shows that global immigrants are giving rise to new forms of cosmopolitan citizenship.",

"summary": "Postcolonial, gender and science studies have long been neglected in German sociology and kept separate in special discourses with regard to their different studied phenomena. Nevertheless are their heuristics very similar: They discuss the differentiation of nature and culture, decentralize the >classical< concept of the subject and criticize the > Western< project of modernity. This convergence of postcolonial, gender and science studies will be developed systematically in this article with reference to their central concepts. Furthermore it will be asked which blind spots of sociology it can illuminate and where the limits of their renewal of social theory are.\n\nPostcolonial, gender und science studies wurden aufgrund ihrer unterschiedlichen Ph\u00e4nomenologie h\u00e4ufig als Spezialdiskurse in separaten Bindestrich-Soziologien behandelt. Dabei ist ihre Heuristik \u00e4hnlich: Sie problematisieren die Unterscheidung von Natur und Kultur, sie dezentrieren das >klassische< Subjektmodell und kritisieren das > westliche< Projekt der Moderne. In dem Beitrag werden diese Konvergenzen zwischen postcolonial, gender und science studies anhand zentraler Konzepte systematisch herausgearbeitet, um daran anschlie\u00dfend zu fragen, auf welche >blinden Flecken< und Probleme sie die Soziologie aufmerksam machen und wo die Grenzen ihrer Erneuerung der Sozialtheorie liegen.

The comparative corpus draws on three highly illustrative essays from English, French and Italian literature at the turn of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century: Oscar Wilde\u2019s \"The Critic as Artist\" (1890), Marcel Proust\u2019s \"Sentiments filiaux d\u2019un parricide\" (1907), and Renato Serra\u2019s \"Ringraziamento a una ballata di Paul Fort\" (1914). My thesis is that these hybrid essays represent a new intellectual critique of bourgeois individualism during the crisis of modern Europe from the Great Depression of 1873-1896 up to the First World War. Nevertheless, their narrative frames do not lay the groundwork for a new literary genre, oriented either philosophically or narratively. Rather, the introduction of a narrative framework within the essay aims at protecting the essayist and the individual from a collapse into the external narrative of history.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 41221715, "asset_id": 14532272, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4261026, "first_name": "Guido Mattia", "last_name": "Gallerani", "domain_name": "unibo", "page_name": "GuidoMattiaGallerani", "display_name": "Guido Mattia Gallerani", "profile_url": "https://unibo.academia.edu/GuidoMattiaGallerani?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4261026/1690731/33651419/s65_guido_mattia.gallerani.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2, "name": "Creative Nonfiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creative_Nonfiction?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 659, "name": "Comparative Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Literature?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8536, "name": "Hybridization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridization?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19362, "name": "Marcel Proust", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marcel_Proust?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 21514, "name": "Oscar Wilde", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oscar_Wilde?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 23534, "name": "Individualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Individualism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 33162, "name": "Essay (Genre Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Essay_Genre_Theory_?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 59462, "name": "Literary Genres", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_Genres?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 65130, "name": "Exempla", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exempla?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 90831, "name": "Essays", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Essays?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 105673, "name": "Essay", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Essay?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 355670, "name": "Renato Serra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Renato_Serra?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 11496504, "title": "The multicultural civil sphere and the universality of binary codes", "created_at": "2015-03-17T17:59:32.377-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11496504/The_multicultural_civil_sphere_and_the_universality_of_binary_codes?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_11496504", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37013685, "asset_id": 11496504, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3329441, "first_name": "Vince", "last_name": "Marotta", "domain_name": "deakin", "page_name": "VinceMarotta", "display_name": "Vince Marotta", "profile_url": "https://deakin.academia.edu/VinceMarotta?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3329441/1114810/31501499/s65_vince.marotta.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8617, "name": "Binary Code", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Binary_Code?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9650, "name": "Cultural Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Identity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43017, "name": "Civil Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Civil_Society?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 567821, "name": "The Stranger", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Stranger?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 11259444, "title": "L'Italie du Nord pr\u00e9romaine : multi-ethnicit\u00e9, m\u00e9tissages ou transferts culturels ?, in S.

Secondly, it will analyze two case studies to provide a vivid picture of consumer video activism (CVA), disentangling its hybrid dynamics in the complex interaction between consumers, businesses, We-media, mainstream media and the public.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 71762745, "asset_id": 56319407, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 115809990, "first_name": "Zizheng", "last_name": "Yu", "domain_name": "gre", "page_name": "ZizhengYu", "display_name": "Zizheng Yu", "profile_url": "https://gre.academia.edu/ZizhengYu?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/115809990/29375364/79034265/s65_zizheng.yu.jpg"}, {"id": 708981, "first_name": "Emiliano", "last_name": "Trer\u00e9", "domain_name": "cardiff", "page_name": "EmilianoTrer\u00e9", "display_name": "Emiliano  Trer\u00e9", "profile_url": "https://cardiff.academia.edu/EmilianoTrer%C3%A9?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/708981/239742/20934051/s65_emiliano.trer_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12108, "name": "China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 72959, "name": "Hybrid Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybrid_Media?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 600361, "name": "Consumer Activism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Consumer_Activism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3030607, "name": "Short Video", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Short_Video?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 45220852, "title": "Uncensored Visions: Beyond the Barbed Wire with Technology, Anti-Colonialism, and Relationships", "created_at": "2021-02-26T21:45:29.718-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45220852/Uncensored_Visions_Beyond_the_Barbed_Wire_with_Technology_Anti_Colonialism_and_Relationships?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_45220852", "summary": "Photography and technology have always played a role in my exploration of cultural identity and heritage, especially in understanding the generations of my family who arrived to the United States by ship in the late 1880s.

I can see they were committed to representing themselves as Americans, as there is no traditional or formal Japanese attire in sight. The photo displaying the military uniform, the western suits, the dresses, and my family with multiple generations was taken with the purpose to send a print back to Japan, to communicate to my ancestors back in their homeland that they were doing well and were prosperous in the United States.

Living all in close proximity and under Latin rule in a sort of conviventia, these ethnic and confessional groups often interacted and engaged in cross-cultural exchanges that left meaningful traces in their religious art.\nDiscussed equally in Hungarian-, German-, and Romanian-speaking scholarship, this medieval cultural heritage was approached until recently within the framework of each \u2018national\u2019 or \u2018linguistic\u2019 School of Art History, being understood as monolithic blocks that were distinct from and did not communicate with each other. Whereas Hungarian- and German-speaking scholarship remained interested mainly in the art produced by the respective ethnic and confessional groups, Romanian-speaking art historians paid attention to both Western (Catholic) and Eastern (Orthodox) art. In all approaches, however, the ethnic and confessional character of an art produced by a given group was emphasized, transforming thus medieval religious art into a marker of cultural identity that distinguished \u2013 and often opposed \u2013 various ethnic and confessional categories. Nevertheless, such assumptions seem to be contradicted by the complex and dynamic reality of religious art in 14th- and 15th-century Transylvania.\nSubsequently, the present paper aims at identifying and discussing a number of paradigmatic cases for which dichotomous interpretative models used traditionally by Medieval Art Historiography (such as Western vs. Eastern, Catholic vs. Orthodox, or Gothic vs. Byzantine) are not entirely applicable. These instances of mixed art include: painters of Byzantine tradition working for Catholic patrons; Western painters working for Orthodox commissioners; coexistence of Byzantine and Gothic styles within the same church; presence of bilingualism (i.e., Latin and Old Church Slavonic) in church inscriptions; shared devotion of Catholic saints by Eastern-rite Christians; cross-credal artistic patronage; or adoption of Western iconographic models by the Orthodox. These complex questions cannot be answered to only in traditional art-historical terms that would acknowledge stylistic and iconographic differences and would interpret them in terms of artistic influence. They should be situated within the wider methodological framework of Contact Zones Theory (L. M. Pratt) which sees artistic hybridity and eclecticism as meaningful consequences of cultural encounters.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64795029, "asset_id": 44389984, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 725693, "first_name": "Dragos Gh.", "last_name": "Nastasoiu", "domain_name": "nec-ro", "page_name": "DragosGhNastasoiu", "display_name": "Dragos Gh.

Stevenson\u2019s late novella entitled The Beach of Fales\u00e1, how the insular space allows for multiple forms of confluences, and to determine how subversive these confluences are, as well as how this spatial phenomenon affects the text and is conducive to the creation of a highly modern form of adventure. It first examines, at the diegetic level, the cultural, religious and linguistic confluences that are characteristic of the island, and how they potentially question the imperialistic ideal. Then, the article highlights the spatio-temporal duality of the island by highlighting its liminality, and the generic hybridity it leads to, as the novella oscillates between realism, romance and the fantastic, among others. Finally, it studies how this diversity affects the narrative itself, which is indeed highly polyphonic, underlining the extreme formal modernity of a text that stands at the crossroads of voices, languages and points of view.

Helder Arag\u00e3o) arises during the manguebeat movement in the 1990s, in Recife, the capital of Pernambuco state, in northeastern Brazil. In addition to working with multimedia production, in music his work consists of experimental albums of electronic music and also soundtracks for films, theatre play and dance performances. This article analyzes the cultural diversity and mixtures organized by the DJ, which shift the boundaries of hegemonic musical genres articulated by the phonographic industry. Rather, Dolores values underground texts in the memory of media pop music, such as regional traditions rhythms (embola-da, coco, maracatu and frevo). As of the hybridisms present on the albums Contradit\u00f3rio? (2002) and Frevotron (2015), respectively first and last discs, otherness and difference policies are identified on the musical language as well as cultural texts and memory, the symbiosis between, on one hand, DJ and technology, and, on the other, tradition and acoustic instrumentation. On the first album, Dolores plays with the Orchestra Santa Massa, which brings together instruments such as rabeca, percussion, wind instruments, electric guitar and the Isaar Fran\u00e7a's voice. On the last one, the DJ plays with Maestro Spok, frevo saxophonist, one percussionist and a guitarist. Resumo A trajet\u00f3ria art\u00edstica do DJ Dolores (codinome de H\u00e9lder Arag\u00e3o) ganhou for\u00e7a durante o movimento manguebeat, na d\u00e9cada de 1990, no Recife, capital do estado de Pernambuco, no nordeste do Brasil. Al\u00e9m de trabalhar com produ\u00e7\u00e3o multim\u00eddia, na m\u00fasica sua obra \u00e9 composta por \u00e1lbuns experimentais de m\u00fasica eletr\u00f4nica e tamb\u00e9m trilhas sonoras para filmes, pe\u00e7as de teatro e espet\u00e1culos de dan\u00e7a. Este artigo analisa a diversidade cultural e as misturas organi-zadas pelo DJ que deslocam as fronteiras dos g\u00eaneros musicais hegem\u00f4nicos articulados pela ind\u00fastria fonogr\u00e1fica. Ao contr\u00e1rio, Dolores valoriza textos subterr\u00e2neos na mem\u00f3ria da m\u00fasica pop das m\u00eddias, como ritmos de tradi\u00e7\u00f5es regionais (embolada, coco, maracatu e frevo). A partir dos hibridismos presentes nos \u00e1lbuns Contradit\u00f3rio? (2002) e Frevotron (2015), respectivamente primeiro e \u00faltimo disco, s\u00e3o identificadas pol\u00edticas de alteridade e diferen\u00e7a na linguagem, assim como textos culturais e mem\u00f3ria, na simbiose entre, de um lado, DJ e tecnologia, e de outro, tra-di\u00e7\u00e3o e instrumenta\u00e7\u00e3o ac\u00fastica. No primeiro disco, Dolores toca com a Orchestra Santa Massa, que congrega instrumentos como rabeca, percuss\u00f5es, sopros, guitarra e a voz de Isaar Fran\u00e7a.

However, this path dependency often leads to performative, rather than substantive, implementation of reforms and new policies and practices, as well as fatigue and resistance built up by the empty promises and adverse effects that have accompanied capitalist development in the post-independence period.

Far from rationalization and homogenization, the language of mestizaje offers a critique of dominant cultures within a third space which problematizes assimilation and does not aim to reestablish the stability behind monolingualism, which makes acceptable the system of inequalities and exclusions. Such authors as Gloria Anzald\u00faa, Richard Rodr\u00edguez, Guillermo G\u00f3mez-Pe\u00f1a, Ana Lydia Vega, Tato Laviera, \u00c1ngela de Hoyos, Abelardo Delgado, or Nash Candelaria, to name but a few, write their texts in the language of the atravesados, a dialogical language, a syncretic, transmigrated tongue composed of both Spanish and English; a mestizaje discourse that transcends the sum of its parts. They write neither in International English nor in Spanish but appropriate both by \u201ctropicalizing\u201d (Frances Aparicio) the language with new, politicized, transgressive and transcreative meanings. In these cases, the transmigration of languages goes far beyond simplistic binary conceptualizations thus resisting, opposing, rewriting and subverting stereotypes. In the cosmopolitan world (as described by Gerard Delanty, Ulrich Beck or Zygmunt Bauman) figured by the brown (Richard Rodr\u00edguez), language is a blend. Codes are not separate but intrinsically fused. These authors are willing to occupy an interstitial dislocation in order to be recalcitrant to representation either side of the borderline. Latino identity is here mediated and constructed through the struggle over language, a language that textualizes their multiple cultural and hybrid subjectivities.\nTaking Cherr\u00ede Moraga\u2019s Loving in the War Years: lo que nunca pas\u00f3 por sus labios as a case example, I will argue, following Derrida, that monolingualism does not exist and that translation is a trope that may force the master to admit that my language is the language of the Other. By refusing to be simply bilingual, Moraga finds through translation a mestizaje voice. Far from denying the contradictions between worlds she rather uses them productively. Translation is for her the primary metaphor for moving beyond binary oppositions and finally meshing both English and Spanish, the colonizers\u2019 languages, so that a new voice emerges. I see translation as a trope, as the means to tell how words and worlds intersect, clash and are remade into a new language that can no longer be viewed as a source or a target but as both at the same time. Moraga highlights the ambiguity at the heart of this brown language and shows how translation generates a new language that exceeds both English and Spanish and creates a dialogic concept not only of language but also of identity. Like other Latino writers, she does not want to be assimilated but asimilao.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60226873, "asset_id": 36128706, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4822851, "first_name": "M\u00aa del Carmen \u00c1frica", "last_name": "Vidal Claramonte", "domain_name": "usal", "page_name": "\u00c1fricaVidalClaramonte", "display_name": "M\u00aa del Carmen \u00c1frica  Vidal Claramonte", "profile_url": "https://usal.academia.edu/%C3%81fricaVidalClaramonte?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4822851/2075192/15516454/s65_m_del_carmen_frica.vidal_claramonte.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1186, "name": "Translation Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50804, "name": "Literary translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_translation?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35841769, "title": "Feeding a Crowd: Hybridity and the Social Infrastructure behind Street Food Creation in Bandung, Indonesia", "created_at": "2018-02-05T05:41:17.742-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35841769/Feeding_a_Crowd_Hybridity_and_the_Social_Infrastructure_behind_Street_Food_Creation_in_Bandung_Indonesia?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_35841769", "summary": "Based on ethnographic research on street vendors\u2019 activities in Bandung city, this article attempts to uncover the production process of street food. Drawing on Simone\u2019s (2004) idea of people as infrastructure, the research focuses on street vending activities as a conjunction of heterogeneous activities and modes of produc- tion that becomes a platform to support the vendors\u2019 livelihood: for example, the ways in which vendors achieve efficiency in street food production. We need to consider, however, the roles of various actors surrounding the street vending activ- ities that directly or indirectly contribute to the production process of street food, as well as the large network that is created as social infrastructure. This network is an outcome of the ability of vendors, for example, to engage in convivial interac- tions with customers, to create an intimate relationship with food suppliers, and to engage in \u201ca form of labor exchange\u201d with their neighbors. This article argues that such hybrid contributions on the part of street vendors are their efforts to stabilize the network in a fluid and adaptable way that makes a social infrastructure possible.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55720101, "asset_id": 35841769, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4705058, "first_name": "Prananda", "last_name": "Malasan", "domain_name": "itb", "page_name": "PranandaMalasan", "display_name": "Prananda L Malasan", "profile_url": "https://itb.academia.edu/PranandaMalasan?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4705058/1985107/10906467/s65_prananda.malasan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1233, "name": "Social Networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Networks?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 73757, "name": "Informal Sector", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Informal_Sector?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 76635, "name": "Street Food Vendors", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Street_Food_Vendors?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 77342, "name": "Infrastructure", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Infrastructure?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 34509817, "title": "Workshop: varietas / poikilia \u2013 Auf den Spuren einer bunten Philologie", "created_at": "2017-09-07T23:18:17.959-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34509817/Workshop_varietas_poikilia_Auf_den_Spuren_einer_bunten_Philologie?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_34509817", "summary": "Doktorierenden-Workshop der Universit\u00e4ten Basel, Bern und Z\u00fcrich (Basel 26.\u201328.10.2017)", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54374522, "asset_id": 34509817, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 39887307, "first_name": "Sina", "last_name": "Dell'Anno", "domain_name": "unibasel", "page_name": "SInaDellAnno", "display_name": "Sina Dell'Anno", "profile_url": "https://unibasel.academia.edu/SInaDellAnno?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/39887307/13809444/15465414/s65_sina.dell_anno.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 97, "name": "Philology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 816, "name": "Classics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Classics?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 173677, "name": "Grotesque", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Grotesque?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 249220, "name": "Variety", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Variety?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1519043, "name": "Narrative Digression", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative_Digression?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 34265141, "title": "Hibridni \u017eanri: \u0160tudije o kri\u017eancih izkustva, mi\u0161ljenja in literature (Hybrid Genres: Crossing Literature with Thinking and Experience).

Postcolonial theorists recognized hybridity as a useful tool that helped them respond to global and local forms of exploitation by recasting them in terms of identity politics and cultural struggles for recognition. In contrast to postcolonial versions of hybridity, which have dominated literary studies in recent decades, the volume Hybrid Genres consciously limits its scope to the kinds of modern European writing in which literature constitutively blends with discourses of thinking and experience. Following Bakhtin\u2019s idea, the author of Hybrid Genres does not neglect the socio-ideological implications of genre hybridity that emerge at the boundaries of literature. He focuses on metapoetry, the essay, and autobiography as prime examples of hybrid genres in which literary singularity interdiscursively mixes with various kinds of conceptual thinking (philosophy, theory, and the sciences) as well as with nonfiction genres that record the fluidity of experience (from journalism to life writing). In Hybrid Genres, the author further discusses Romantic and Modernist literary devices that create the impression as though literary texts were produced beyond thinking\u2014that is, through hybridization of self-conscious creativity with ecstatic openness to the sublime working of language. In his conclusion, the author tackles the question of how nineteenth-century and contemporary genre theory hybridizes the humanities with concepts borrowed from the natural sciences. Such a tendency is interpreted as a symptom of the humanities\u2019 survival struggle in the conditions of the commodification of knowledge. The thread of the argument of Hybrid Genres lies in the analysis of modern metamorphoses of knowledge systems and changes in the literary field, especially the value of creative work.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54174074, "asset_id": 34265141, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10340509, "first_name": "Marko", "last_name": "Juvan", "domain_name": "zrc-sazu", "page_name": "MarkoJuvan", "display_name": "Marko Juvan", "profile_url": "https://zrc-sazu.academia.edu/MarkoJuvan?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10340509/3155932/20708766/s65_marko.juvan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1258, "name": "Romanticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Romanticism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2206, "name": "Genre studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genre_studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7297, "name": "Autobiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Autobiography?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7888, "name": "Literary Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 19820, "name": "Literature and Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature_and_Philosophy-20?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 20154, "name": "Metafiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Metafiction?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 23457, "name": "Darwinism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Darwinism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 105673, "name": "Essay", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Essay?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 34243861, "title": "For the Machine", "created_at": "2017-08-16T09:00:00.024-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34243861/For_the_Machine?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_34243861", "summary": "A response to Debbora Battaglia's \"Aeroponic Gardens and their Magic: Plants/ Persons/Ethics in Suspension,\" History and Anthropology 2017VOL. 28, NO. 3, 263\u2013292.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54156703, "asset_id": 34243861, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3245029, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Valentine", "domain_name": "umn", "page_name": "DavidValentine", "display_name": "David Valentine", "profile_url": "https://umn.academia.edu/DavidValentine?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3245029/5502327/6270384/s65_david.valentine.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 805, "name": "Ontology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ontology?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1032, "name": "Cyborg Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyborg_Theory?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7944, "name": "Personhood", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Personhood?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13320, "name": "Mars", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mars?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 34792, "name": "Cyborg Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyborg_Anthropology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 347666, "name": "Outer Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Outer_Space?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1237306, "name": "Interspecies Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interspecies_Ethics?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 34080249, "title": "CfP: \"Ibridit\u00e0 e norma \u2013 Norm und Hybridit\u00e4t\" Convegno Associazione Italianisti Germanofoni - Deutscher Italianistentag (Sezione di Scienze della Cultura / Sektion Kulturwissenschaft), Magonza, 1-3 marzo 2018  -  Mainz, 1.\u20133.

to the problem of Orientalism that develops when the West creates a fictitious imagined version of Eastern religion and culture. Said\u2019s notion of Orientalism focuses on the general distorted representation of Eastern religion and culture by the West. Homi Bhabha extends Said\u2019s notion of Orientalism to reveal the tension of the inevitable hybridity between the East and the West. Here, cultural practices develop in the space of hybridity with the intention to promote a feeling of coherence as opposed to with the objective to deform or distort religion and culture. Thus, the intention in a space of hybridity is often not to engage in Orientalism. Instead, the goal is to develop something new in a hybrid form. An opportunity arises in philosophy of education to adequately confront the problem of Orientalism that may develop in a space of hybridity. The author proposes a philosophical postcolonial framework that engages in a creative process that does not further Orientalism but rather develops something new with an ethic of hybrid responsibility for religion and culture. To illustrate this, the author uses Kuchipudi Indian Classical Hindu dance as an example.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53670124, "asset_id": 33662674, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33707822, "first_name": "Dr. Sabrina", "last_name": "MisirHiralall", "domain_name": "montclair", "page_name": "SabrinaDMisirHiralall", "display_name": "Dr. Sabrina D MisirHiralall", "profile_url": "https://montclair.academia.edu/SabrinaDMisirHiralall?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33707822/12538383/14642439/s65_sabrina.misirhiralall_ed.d..png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 114, "name": "Hinduism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hinduism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1751, "name": "Creativity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creativity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13995, "name": "Postcolonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 29167, "name": "Dance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dance?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 51334, "name": "Orientalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Orientalism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 104265, "name": "Bharatanatyam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bharatanatyam?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 200040, "name": "Religion and Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Education?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 266984, "name": "Kuchipudi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kuchipudi?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 31047917, "title": "Plurilingual corpora and polylanguaging, where corpus linguistics meets contact linguistics (2016)", "created_at": "2017-01-23T06:33:59.020-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31047917/Plurilingual_corpora_and_polylanguaging_where_corpus_linguistics_meets_contact_linguistics_2016_?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_31047917", "summary": "Language contact and multilingualism issues are addressed by so diverse research traditions that we consider corpora and data exchange as good ways to make these traditions discuss.

Bots become agents by harnessing profile settings, popularity measures, and automated conversation tools, along with vast amounts of user data that social media platforms make available. This article develops an ecological approach to thinking about bots that focuses on how social media environments propel bots into agency. This habitat-based model uses bots to expose ripe targets of intervention and innovation at the level of interface design. It also situates bots in the context of platform providers with a vested interest in interface design, revealing a range of new political problems.

Drawing on narratives from 58 immigrants of seven different origin countries residing in Catalonia, Spain, who are in romantic partnerships with Spanish-born people, we focus on preferences and prejudices related to mixing. We find that the members of exogamous couples both suffer social discrimination regarding the crossing of ethnocultural borders, particularly from their respective family members \u2013 a rejection that is based on negative stereotypes and preconceptions linked to the partner's origin, phenotype or ethnocultural characteristics, such as religion, in intersection with gender. More significantly, we also find that ethno-racial prejudices (particularly when referring to marriage preferences for the respondents and their children) and discriminatory attitudes (towards one's own and other immigrant minority groups) also exist among intermarried couples themselves. In sum, we question the role of mixed unions as a diluter of differences and an accelerator of integration.\n\nPublished First Online (March 28, 2016):

\u2018CNN effect\u2019 concept was coined two decades ago, it quickly became a popular shorthand to understand media-conflict interactions. Although the connection has probably always been more complex than what was captured in the concept, research needs to be updated in order to better\nunderstand the multifaceted contemporary environments of both media and conflict. There are growing numbers and types of media sources, and multiple interactions between media and conflict actors, policymakers and engaged publics from the local to the global and back. We argue that understanding the impact of media reporting on conflict requires a new framework that captures the multilevel and hybrid media environments of contemporary conflicts. This study provides a roadmap of how to systematically unpack this environment. It describes and explains how different levels, interactions, and forms of news reporting shape conflicts and peacebuilding in local, national and regional contexts, and how international responses interact with multiple media narratives. With these tools, comprehensive understandings of contemporary local to global media interactions can be incorporated into new research on media and conflict.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43347043, "asset_id": 22793976, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 932687, "first_name": "Jason", "last_name": "Miklian", "domain_name": "uio", "page_name": "JasonMiklian", "display_name": "Jason Miklian", "profile_url": "https://uio.academia.edu/JasonMiklian?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/932687/4495175/5206464/s65_jason.miklian.ashx"}, {"id": 238918, "first_name": "Maria", "last_name": "Gabrielsen Jumbert", "domain_name": "prio", "page_name": "MariaGabrielsenJumbert", "display_name": "Maria Gabrielsen Jumbert", "profile_url": "https://prio.academia.edu/MariaGabrielsenJumbert?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/238918/3434336/4104291/s65_maria.gabrielsen_jumbert.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 859, "name": "Communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communication?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 928, "name": "Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 933, "name": "New Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Media?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2869, "name": "Digital Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Media?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 7369, "name": "Political communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_communication?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 9246, "name": "Social Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13872, "name": "Facebook", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Facebook?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13873, "name": "Twitter", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Twitter?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 24048, "name": "Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_Studies?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 45578, "name": "Peacebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peacebuilding?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 87805, "name": "Newspapers and online journalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Newspapers_and_online_journalism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 393534, "name": "CNN effect", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/CNN_effect?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 601581, "name": "News Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/News_Analysis?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 9773802, "title": "Despre datarea picturilor murale ale bisericii Sf.

This article draws upon a political ecology of education framework to analyze how schools advance alternative land management strategies and forms of environmental knowledge. Schools catering to grassroots movements can actualize their emancipatory objectives by institutionalizing hybridized conceptions of educational space-time. This article focuses on a vocational high school in a settlement of the Brazilian Landless Workers' Movement. It analyzes a document known as a 'political pedagogical project' (PPP) which details the identity of the school and how it sees itself as a tool for social and environmental justice. Through an analysis of this PPP, my article explores how the school seeks to educate students to critically reflect upon the relationships between political economic processes and landscape change. The PPP also encourages students to be active participants in the development of a regional agroecological science, and cooperative material relations. From a political ecology of education perspective, activist schools are important sites for the co-production of environmental knowledge and material relations. They have the potential to help students learn critically about the linkages between power, political economy, and land management.\n\nComment l'\u00e9ducation peut servir de m\u00e9diateur de la relation entre la co-production de connaissances sur l'environnement, et de la reproduction sociale d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 alternative?

Of restricted dimensions, they have, as a rule, been considered as non-functional artifacts, yet a number of them may show uncommon features, in particular a strikingly large size and unusual, possibly functional characteristics. Besides, in some of these cases, the identification of the represented being or the recognition of some of its traits may be difficult. Whether we call such qualities species ambiguity, liminality between the real and non-rational, or deceit towards the non-initiated, the fact remains that some figurines reflect, if not an imaginary world, at least a world we cannot identify, and may create effects, convey meanings and permit uses dissenting them from those of usual figurine \"norms\". As we often lack contextual information about such materials, we can only speculate about the reasons and objectives of these aspects of prehistoric imagery.

What remains highly questionable, however, is how \"Soviet\" those templates actually are and whether modern writers of Soviet history actually employ them.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 76912006, "asset_id": 65213034, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4124614, "first_name": "Nikolai", "last_name": "Krementsov", "domain_name": "utoronto", "page_name": "NikolaiKrementsov", "display_name": "Nikolai Krementsov", "profile_url": "https://utoronto.academia.edu/NikolaiKrementsov?f_ri=4138", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1567, "name": "Soviet History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soviet_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3723, "name": "History of Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Science?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8265, "name": "Biography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biography?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12396, "name": "Post-Soviet Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Soviet_Studies?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 65040755, "title": "Hybridity in Peacebuilding and Development: A Critical Interrogation", "created_at": "2021-12-18T18:23:56.881-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/65040755/Hybridity_in_Peacebuilding_and_Development_A_Critical_Interrogation?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_65040755", "summary": "This In Brief introduces the malleable and contested concept of \u2018hybridity\u2019 with a view to establishing its heuristic value for academics and practitioners working in the fields of peacebuilding and development.

There are many contemporary words to theorize artistic mixture, from those that are trained on how different elements mix\u2014including bricolage, assemblage, and pastiche\u2014to those like hybridity, mestizaje, and creolization, which powerfully address cultural mixture within the asymmetrical power dynamics of colonialism.

To do so, I attend to eclecticism\u2019s history in Europe and at the Maratha court in western India, align it with other terms for artistic selection and fusion in South Asia\u2014such as the process of \u201cpatching\u201d arts together in an album, or muraqqa\u02bf\u2014and contend with eclecticism\u2019s relationship to empire.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2649750, "first_name": "Holly", "last_name": "Shaffer", "domain_name": "brown", "page_name": "HollyShaffer", "display_name": "Holly Shaffer", "profile_url": "https://brown.academia.edu/HollyShaffer?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2649750/844962/3002180/s65_holly.shaffer.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1186, "name": "Translation Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 50410822, "title": "A haszidizmus recepci\u00f3ja Borb\u00e9ly Szil\u00e1rd m\u0171veiben", "created_at": "2021-07-30T14:18:29.503-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/50410822/A_haszidizmus_recepci%C3%B3ja_Borb%C3%A9ly_Szil%C3%A1rd_m%C5%B1veiben?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_50410822", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68409501, "asset_id": 50410822, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 53072779, "first_name": "Sz\u00e1z", "last_name": "P\u00e1l", "domain_name": "comeniusuniversity", "page_name": "Sz\u00e1zP\u00e1l", "display_name": "Sz\u00e1z P\u00e1l", "profile_url": "https://comeniusuniversity.academia.edu/Sz%C3%A1zP%C3%A1l?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/53072779/14392861/15309923/s65_sz_z.p_l.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11452, "name": "Memory Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_Studies?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26467, "name": "Hasidism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hasidism?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 907613, "name": "Magyar nyelv \u00e9s irodalom", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Magyar_nyelv_es_irodalom?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922189, "name": "Hasidic Tales", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hasidic_Tales?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1218008, "name": "Neo Hasidism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neo_Hasidism?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 2555984, "name": "Borb\u00e9ly Szil\u00e1rd", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borb%C3%A9ly_Szil%C3%A1rd?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 47468319, "title": "Beyond the Boundaries of Realism: Monstrous Islands and Literary Hybrids at the Fin de Si\u00e8cle in Conan Doyle\u2019s, R.L.

Pony Bravo draws on a variety of music traditions, connecting the sound and rhythm of the various marginalized \u00absouths\u00bb: U.S. southern roots rock and blues, Andalusian rock, flamenco, African and Jamaican rhythms, etc. As they play with these traditions, the group uses their platform to fight for the right to do so: to borrow, to sample, to quote, to remix, to collage, to recycle the rhythms, melodies, harmonies, lyrics, ideas, and images of those creators and tricksters that came before them. With help from Walter Benjamin\u00b4s dichotomy between auratic and nonauratic artforms, this article explores the inflation of subcultural capital in indie music (through fan assimilation of nonauratic knowledge) and the elevation of the auratic live artifact as a reaction by those who would keep that currency in check. Daniel Alonso elevates the auratic moment captured as content within the nonauratic form of the archived online promotional poster. He simultaneously champions the demise of all forms of the nonauratic in his embrace of a sort of cultural capital socialism vis-\u00e0-vis creative commons (instead of intellectual property) licensing and his antagonistic stance toward the institutions (the SGAE) and legislation (la ley Sinde) that fight for the protection of national and international artists\u00b4 IP rights. \r\n\r\nResumen \r\n\r\nEste art\u00edculo investiga la econom\u00eda cultural de la escena indie internacional con un enfoque especial en la banda de neoflamenco indie con base en Sevilla llamada Pony Bravo y, espec\u00edficamente, en Daniel Alonso Mall\u00e9n, cantante de la banda y visionario prol\u00edfico del montaje gr\u00e1fico y sonoro. Pony Bravo se basa en una variedad de tradiciones musicales, conectando el sonido y el ritmo de los distintos \u00absures\u00bb marginados: El blues y el rock de sure\u00f1o de Estados Unidos, el rock andaluz, el flamenco, los ritmos africano y jamaicano, etc. Mientras juegan con estas tradiciones, el grupo utiliza su plataforma para luchar por el derecho a hacerlo: tomar prestado, samplear, citar, remezclar, collagear, reciclar los ritmos, melod\u00edas, armon\u00edas, letras, ideas e im\u00e1genes de los creadores y embaucadores que los precedieron. Con la ayuda de la dicotom\u00eda de Walter Benjamin entre formas de arte aur\u00e1ticas y no aur\u00e1ticas, este art\u00edculo explora la inflaci\u00f3n del capital subcultural en la m\u00fasica indie (a trav\u00e9s de la asimilaci\u00f3n de los conocimientos no aur\u00e1ticos) y la elevaci\u00f3n del artefacto aur\u00e1tico (el concierto en vivo) como una reacci\u00f3n de quienes querr\u00edan controlar esa inflaci\u00f3n. Daniel Alonso eleva el momento aur\u00e1tico capturado como contenido dentro de la forma no aur\u00e1tico del cartel promocional archivado en l\u00ednea. Simult\u00e1neamente, aboga por la aniquilaci\u00f3n de todas las formas de lo no aur\u00e1tico en su abrazo de una especie de socialismo con respecto al capital cultural a trav\u00e9s de las licencias Creative Commons en vez de la propiedad intelectual y su postura antag\u00f3nica hacia las instituciones (SGAE) y la legislaci\u00f3n (la ley Sinde) que luchan por la protecci\u00f3n de los derechos de propiedad intelectual de artistas nacionales e internacionales.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61723182, "asset_id": 41468875, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 291663, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Arnold", "domain_name": "umn", "page_name": "MichaelArnold", "display_name": "Michael Arnold", "profile_url": "https://umn.academia.edu/MichaelArnold?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/291663/59133/11265662/s65_michael.arnold.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 967, "name": "Intellectual Property", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intellectual_Property?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5579, "name": "Authenticity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Authenticity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6442, "name": "Creative Commons", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creative_Commons?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 8330, "name": "Walter Benjamin", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Walter_Benjamin?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 8811, "name": "Cultural Economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Economics?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 13339, "name": "Cultural Capital", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Capital?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 16898, "name": "Blues", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Blues?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 47389, "name": "Flamenco", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Flamenco?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 58166, "name": "Indie Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indie_Music?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 77267, "name": "Remix", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Remix?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 83703, "name": "Audiovisual", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Audiovisual?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 174941, "name": "Rock Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rock_Music?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 192978, "name": "Andalusian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Andalusian_Studies?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 41048929, "title": "Music & Sound-tracks of our everyday lives: Music & Sound-making, Meaning-making, Self-making", "created_at": "2019-11-24T16:32:06.387-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41048929/Music_and_Sound_tracks_of_our_everyday_lives_Music_and_Sound_making_Meaning_making_Self_making?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_41048929", "summary": "The aim of this professional Doctor of Creative Industries (DCI) Research Project was to investigate music-making practice and Self as a practitioner in the process of creating and producing a DIY music artifact. Specifically: to investigate why I as the practitioner felt a connection with one form of music-making (acoustic instrument-based), and not a connection with another form of music-making (digital virtual-based). As a phenomenologist, I situated Self into this auto-ethnographic study in the dual roles of researcher and practitioner; developing first-person narratives of my personal journey, critical reflection and reflexive practice. The holistic and multi-dimensional nature of this research has provided rich and nuanced data, illuminating the co-constituted nature of Self, interpreting meaning, and practice. In particular, the research study contextualises contemporary DIY creative practice relative to three interdependent tenets: music & sound-making practice, meaning-making and Self-making, where these tenets are understood in terms of hybridity, agency and subjectivity. \n\nCONCEPTS \u2022 Human-centred computing~User studies \u2022 Applied computing~Sound and music computing", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61321602, "asset_id": 41048929, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24732828, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Page", "domain_name": "qut", "page_name": "DavidLPage", "display_name": "David L Page", "profile_url": "https://qut.academia.edu/DavidLPage?f_ri=4138", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24732828/6690184/28819391/s65_david.page.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 972, "name": "Self and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_and_Identity?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2852, "name": "Narrative", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3022, "name": "Human Values", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Values?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3186, "name": "Sonic Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sonic_Art?f_ri=4138", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3188, "name": "Auto-ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Auto-ethnography?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5044, "name": "Embodiment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Embodiment?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5178, "name": "Phenomenology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 5579, "name": "Authenticity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Authenticity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 10320, "name": "Electroacoustic Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Electroacoustic_Music?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 35032, "name": "Music Production", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music_Production?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 36607, "name": "Practice-led art research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Practice-led_art_research?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 54659, "name": "Subjectivity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subjectivity?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 61922, "name": "Agency", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agency?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 67456, "name": "Dialogical Self Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dialogical_Self_Theory?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 226360, "name": "Soundscapes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soundscapes?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 231343, "name": "Voices", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Voices?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 559087, "name": "Arts Practice as Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arts_Practice_as_Research?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 920587, "name": "Self Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_Leadership?f_ri=4138"}, {"id": 1672764, "name": "Sountracks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sountracks?f_ri=4138"}]}, {"id": 40994074, "title": "Ambivalence towards the Religious Other: Depicting St. Francis of Assisi and Franciscans in the Orthodox Churches of Venetian-ruled Crete", "created_at": "2019-11-20T01:34:30.622-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40994074/Ambivalence_towards_the_Religious_Other_Depicting_St_Francis_of_Assisi_and_Franciscans_in_the_Orthodox_Churches_of_Venetian_ruled_Crete?f_ri=4138", "dom_id": "work_40994074", "summary": "Saint Francis of Assisi (1181/2 \u2013 3 October 1226) was an Italian Catholic friar, deacon, and preacher, who founded the male Order of Friars Minor, the female Order of Saint Clare, the secular Third Order, and the Custody of the Holy Land. His imitatio Christi made manifest through the receiving of the stigmata during an apparition of Seraphic angels in religious ecstasy (1224), as well as the model of conduct based on poverty and apostolic life that he instituted among his followers have made him one of the most venerated saints of the Roman Catholic Church during the Late Middle Ages. His immense popularity transgressed confessional borders, the Poverello of Assisi having been venerated occasionally also by the Orthodox living in cultural contact zones such as Southern Italy or Venetian-ruled Crete.\n\nThe present paper addresses the ambivalent attitude of the Orthodox towards Saint Francis and Franciscans, as it appears in the 14th- and 15th-century mural decoration of several Orthodox churches on Venetian-ruled Crete. On the one hand, Saint Francis\u2019 veneration by the Orthodox is clearly attested by the inclusion of his image as a stigmatized saint in the iconographic program of several churches: Panagia Kera in Kritsa (14th century); Zoodochos Pege in Sambas (late-14th \u2013 early-15th century); Holy Archangel Michael in Kato Astrakon (15th century); and Presentation of the Holy Virgin in Sklaverohori (mid-15th century). On the other hand, the hostility and resentment of the Orthodox towards Latin rule and Catholic confession became explicit in the representation of Franciscan monks among the sinners and heretics of the Last Judgment: the Churches of St. John the Baptist in Deliana (late-13th \u2013 early-14th century) and Kritsa (second half of the 14th century). By contextualizing a range of images and texts, the present paper seeks to understand on which occasions was the religious other regarded either as positive or negative, and how was this ambivalent perception and expression of the Catholic other reconciled among the non-Catholics (Orthodox) of medieval Crete.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61275797, "asset_id": 40994074, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 725693, "first_name": "Dragos Gh.", "last_name": "Nastasoiu", "domain_name": "nec-ro", "page_name": "DragosGhNastasoiu", "display_name": "Dragos Gh.

This essay describes an individual experience with listening (and nonlistening) during one health care event, using that narrative to explicate how listening intersects with identity creation and interpretation in medical contexts. Recognizing our complex hybrid identities in racial, ethnic, and disability frames can create new insights for listening. In this brief reflection, I consider how hybrid disability and Asian American identities impact how we may listen to each other. Identities, my own included, evolve as people interact physically and psychologically with personal illnesses that change their abilities. Listening to individual agency and changing identities is crucial in medical contexts, and any context, where hybridity prompts different social and individual privileges and expectations.
