How to make sense of the shadow-play as a form of world-making? In Tall Tree, Nest of the Wind, Bernard Arps explores this question by considering an all-night performance of Dewa Ruci, a key play in the repertoire. Thrilling and profound, Dewa Ruci describes the mighty Bratasena\u2019s quest for the ultimate mystical insight.\n     The book presents  Dewa Ruci as rendered by the distinguished master puppeteer Ki Anom Soeroto in Amsterdam in 1987. The book\u2019s unusual design presents the performance texts together with descriptions of the sounds and images that would remain obscure in conventional formats of presentation. Copious annotations probe beneath the surface and provide an understanding of the performance's cultural complexity. These annotations explain the meanings of puppet action, music, and shifts in language; how the puppeteer wove together into the drama the circumstances of the performance in Amsterdam, Islamic and other religious ideas, and references to contemporary Indonesian political ideology. Also revealed is the performance\u2019s historical multilayering and the picture it paints of the Javanese past.\n     Tall Tree, Nest of the Wind not only presents an unrivalled insight into the artistic depth of wayang kulit, it exemplifies a new field of study, the philology of performance.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45693702, "asset_id": 22488991, "asset_type": "Work",

unpacks the significance of the \u201cworlds\u201d that narrative films create, offering an innovative perspective on cinema as art. Drawing on aesthetics and the philosophy of art in both the continental and analytic traditions, as well as modern and contemporary film theory, it weaves together multiple strands of thought and analysis to provide new understandings of filmic representation, fictionality, expression, self-reflexivity, style, and the full range of cinema\u2019s affective and symbolic dimensions.\r\n\r\nAlways more than \u201cfictional worlds\u201d and \u201cstoryworlds\u201d on account of cinema\u2019s full perceptual, cognitive, and affective nature, film worlds are theorized as immersive and transformative artistic realities. As such, they are capable of fostering novel ways of seeing, feeling, and understanding experience. Engaging with the writings of Jean Mitry, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Christian Metz, David Bordwell, Gilles Deleuze, and Hans-Georg Gadamer, among other thinkers, Film Worlds extends Nelson Goodman\u2019s analytic account of symbolic and artistic \u201cworldmaking\u201d to cinema, expands on French philosopher Mikel Dufrenne\u2019s phenomenology of aesthetic experience in relation to films and their worlds, and addresses the hermeneutic dimensions of cinematic art. It emphasizes what both celluloid and digital filmmaking and viewing share with the creation and experience of all art, while at the same time recognizing what is unique to the moving image in aesthetic terms. The resulting framework reconciles central aspects of realist and formalist/neo-formalist positions in film theory while also moving beyond them and seeks to open new avenues of exploration in film studies and the philosophy of film.\r\n\r\nENDORSEMENTS\r\n\r\n\"A half-century after Jean Mitry's magisterial integration of classical film theory, Daniel Yacavone has done the same for its modern counterpart, managing not just to reconcile, but to recruit the extremes of cognitivism and of phenomenology for his prodigious satellite mapping of the terrae incognitae he rightly calls \"Film Worlds.\" Without hyperbole or histrionics, Yacavone delivers a stable and progressive suite of concepts that address films as texts and as embodied affect, he has culled these from a balanced review of an impressive roster of film theorists as well as of the 20th century thinkers many of them have drawn on, some of whom, notably Nelson Goodman and Ernst Cassirer, have been waiting in the wing to contribute to a compelling vision like Yacavone's. That vision not only illuminates how films work but how they work on us, and even work for us.\"\r\n-Dudley Andrew, Professor of Film and Comparative Literature, Yale University\r\n\r\n\"Yacavone's Film Worlds is a major reconsideration of the nature of aesthetic experience through the medium of cinema. Film Worlds offers new insights into the hermeneutical and phenomenological perspectives of Hans-Georg Gadamer and Mikel Dufrenne, as well as Nelson Goodman's concept of world-making. The book also presents a significant revision of our understanding of modern and contemporary film theory from Mitry and Metz to Bordwell and Deleuze. This brilliant and original work will be of interest to philosophers and film scholars alike.\"\r\n-D. N. Rodowick, Glen A. Lloyd Distinguished Service Professor in the Division of the Humanities at the University of Chicago\r\n\r\n\"Yacavone articulates an approach to cinema that incorporates elements of various tendencies in current film theory -- including, chiefly, those of a broadly sociocultural bent, those focused on empirical studies and cognitive science, and those stressing the phenomenological dimension of spectatorship -- and to unite them via the concept of cinematic \"worlds.\" His command of the theoretical literature is impressive, and his references to analytic and continental philosophy and film theory are wide-ranging and inclusive of most of the approaches adopted over the last century.\"\r\n-Ronald Bogue, Distinguished Research Professor, Josiah Meigs Distinguished

identified as \"Javanese\" or \"from Java\" in traditional Malay literature and performance \u2014 settings, characters, objects, idioms, stories, texts, even entire genres like the renditions of Mahabharata story-matter \u2014 has mostly been ascribed to the putative prestige of the historical civilization of Java. Here I explore another point of view. Focusing on religiosity and ethics in a hikayat with Mahabharata stories, I propose the notion of javanaiserie, the creation of texts, performances, and other cultural artefacts designed to be considered Javanese. Javanaiserie has proven alluring in Malay contexts. Rather than as a matter of influence I suggest regarding javanaiserie as an active process of worldmaking, the creation of a reality that is culturally at once close to and distinct from an audience's everyday lifeworld, a reality that can be both elegant and evil, appealing as well as appalling.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55151128, "asset_id": 35290664, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 819221, "first_name": "Bernard", "last_name": "Arps", "domain_name": "leidenuniv", "page_name": "BernardArps", "display_name": "Bernard Arps", "profile_url": "https://leidenuniv.academia.edu/BernardArps?f_ri=434939", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/819221/284134/336041/s65_bernard.arps.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 97, "name": "Philology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philology?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 122, "name": "Comparative Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Religion?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 123, "name": "Mythology And Folklore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mythology_And_Folklore?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8150, "name": "Anthropology Of Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_Of_Literature?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 48550, "name": "Religious Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Studies?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 58909, "name": "Mahabharata", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mahabharata?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 60818, "name": "Classical Malay Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Classical_Malay_Literature?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 98424, "name": "Asian Theatre and Performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Theatre_and_Performance?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 107947, "name": "Anthropology of Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Islam?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 164084, "name": "Wayang", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wayang?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 166284, "name": "Batavia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Batavia?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 243982, "name": "Javanese studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Javanese_studies?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 244916, "name": "Malay Language and Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Language_and_Literature?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 267435, "name": "Balinese and Old Javanese Manuscripts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Balinese_and_Old_Javanese_Manuscripts?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 384865, "name": "Diegesis, diegetic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diegesis_diegetic?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 427470, "name": "Wayang kulit", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wayang_kulit?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 434939, "name": "Worldmaking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Worldmaking?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 483761, "name": "Ethnicity in Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity_in_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 576036, "name": "Quest Narratives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Quest_Narratives?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 576037, "name": "Javanese literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Javanese_literature?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 576038, "name": "Old Javanese literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Old_Javanese_literature?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 586820, "name": "Malay Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Culture?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 619396, "name": "Anthropology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Religion?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 634898, "name": "Ethnicity In Malaysia and Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity_In_Malaysia_and_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 800885, "name": "Dewa Ruci", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dewa_Ruci?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 1115209, "name": "Jawi Manuscripts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jawi_Manuscripts?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 1800591, "name": "Betawi Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Betawi_Culture?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 2476675, "name": "Philology of performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philology_of_performance?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 2832338, "name": "javanaiserie", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/javanaiserie?f_ri=434939"}]}, {"id": 1255948, "title": "Wolfgang Iser.

The present work remedies that problem by analysing Iser\u2019s German and English writings in detail. Apart from being the first comprehensive account of his work, this study also modifies the established view of Iser\u2019s theory. In contrast to the idea that his only contribution to literary studies is the reception theory of the 1970s, this account demonstrates the importance of Iser\u2019s work on history and anthropology from the 1950s and 1990s. Instead of exclusively focusing on familiar terms such as \u2018indeterminacy\u2019, this analysis also discusses Iser\u2019s view of modernity, fiction and culture. As this discussion shows, his writings develop a consistent theory of the novel and the way in which it allows its readers to articulate new views of reality. To situate this theory, Iser\u2019s institutional and intellectual background is described as well, paying special attention to the Poetik und Hermeneutik-circle and thinkers like Blumenberg and Kermode. The continued relevance of his theory is demonstrated via comparisons with recent research on the novel and memory as well as examples from contemporary novelists like Juli Zeh and Hilary Mantel.",

Those who lived through the Revolutionary era perceived their age as one of form failure, and the grotesque was the exceptionally supple, pliable medium through which these anxieties could be expressed.

An expert way of apprehending space requires seeing beyond the screen, puppets, and silhouettes, or even looking away from them.

It was presented to the Bodleian Library, Oxford, in 1629. Its text-titled Stories of Amir (Caritanira Amir)-sheds new light on the literary and cultural history of Java and the wider Java Sea world. Probably composed in the 1500s, possibly in Banten, the text contains part of an adaptation of the Malay Hikayat Amir Hamzah, itself a rendition of an eleventh-century text in Persian. The protagonist Hamza was an uncle of the Prophet Muhammad. His epic story used to be told across Islamic Asia in a range of literary and performance genres.

Since the growing uncertainty of living in a world in crisis seems to continuously threaten the possibility of the future, this project seeks to contribute to the growing scholarship on this topic from the perspective of Latin American contemporary art. We hope that by providing a take on the future, the initial artistic and curatorial imaginaries gathered here can help counter the defuturing narratives that stagnate our mobilizing potential for constructing other ways of being and existing in the world. \n\nIn the face of generalized pessimism, it is essential to remember that recent uprisings and social movements have opened the door to alternative imaginaries for thriving amid end-of-the-world scenarios. Especially as these imaginaries underscore the fact that looking back in time constitutes a powerful form of anti-colonial resistance. This proposal for engaging in an assemblage against extinction, however, prompts two different albeit related questions namely: where is the future? And whose world are we to imagine? We invited an array of collaborators from Latin America to provide a multiplicity of answers so that together we can foster the beginning of what could be a collective imaginary for Horizon-tality. \n\nIn the next few entries readers will find a variety of provocations: some propose other ways of telling time (past, present, future); others may incite us to follow new directions or assume new orientations; may offer imaginaries for what an indigenous, Black, queer, or feminist proposition for Horizon-tality would look like; additional ones may help us to think about what an interspecies Horizon-tality could entail, and lastly, they may altogether offer us an (aesth)et(h)ics for collaged and stitched-together assemblages for being and existing in the world outside of the modern-colonial world system. \n\nSee the entire project at https://www.coleccioncisneros.org/editorial/featured/notes-horizon-tality ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64607924, "asset_id": 44237471, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 27541714, "first_name": "Sara", "last_name": "Garz\u00f3n", "domain_name": "cornell", "page_name": "SaraGarzon", "display_name": "Sara Garz\u00f3n", "profile_url": "https://cornell.academia.edu/SaraGarzon?f_ri=434939", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/27541714/36982743/35836804/s65_sara.garz_n.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8694, "name": "Science Fiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_Fiction?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 124380, "name": "Worlding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Worlding?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 297566, "name": "Modern & Contemporary Latin American Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_and_Contemporary_Latin_American_Art?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 434939, "name": "Worldmaking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Worldmaking?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1277570, "name": "Indigenous Futurism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Futurism?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 3496600, "name": "Latin American Futurism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Futurism?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 3779146, "name": "The Pluriverse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Pluriverse?f_ri=434939"}]}, {"id": 40315494, "title": "The ethnolinguistic listener: narrativity and ideologies of local language in urban Banyuwangi [2019]", "created_at": "2019-09-11T02:31:57.782-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40315494/The_ethnolinguistic_listener_narrativity_and_ideologies_of_local_language_in_urban_Banyuwangi_2019_?f_ri=434939", "dom_id": "work_40315494", "summary": "About urban Banyuwangi (East Java) as a contact zone between languages, ethnicities, and religions, focusing on models of communication in academic linguistics and in local ideologies of language and ethnicity.

Core to these analogous developments is the mythologization of the figure of the \u201cband\u201d as a creative agent and \u201cworld-maker.\u201d These shared absorptive capacities in art and music bring us the question at the heart of this essay: What does a rock band have in common with a work of contemporary art? Although this might initially appear to be a rather odd line of enquiry, we found this question sufficiently intriguing to actually \u201cform\u201d a band\u2014named the Ghosts of Nothing\u2014to perform an artist function within the \u201cartworld.\u201d  And it is with this particular collaborative mutation of the artistic function in mind that we will attempt to tease out the slippery notion of \u201cbandness.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough the ontology of music\u2014including popular and rock music\u2014has, in general terms, been the focus of much scholarly activity in recent decades, the ontology of bandness as a specific topic within this expansive field has received surprisingly little attention.  As John Andrew Fisher observes, there is an ontological complexity to rock music\u2014which he distinguishes from both popular and classical music\u2014that arises from \u201cwhole domains of aesthetic interest\u201d that are not necessarily as evident in other musical genres.  Fisher, Gracyk, and others have identified the centrality of recordings to any proper account of the ontology of rock music.  We suggest that the elusive quality of bandness also features prominently in this ontological landscape and is important for both rock and other forms of popular music. Our aim, in what follows, is not to develop a systematic account of all the relevant issues, but rather to offer a preliminary sketch of the implications of pursuing one particular line of thought in what turns out to be an intriguingly multi-faceted problem. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 90486114, "asset_id": 62741497, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13358745, "first_name": "Sean", "last_name": "Lowry", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "SeanLowry", "display_name": "Sean  Lowry", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/SeanLowry?f_ri=434939", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13358745/3831522/16578120/s65_sean.lowry.jpg"}, {"id": 176131506, "first_name": "Ilmar", "last_name": "Taimre", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "IlmarTaimre", "display_name": "Ilmar Taimre", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/IlmarTaimre?f_ri=434939", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/176131506/82709808/71319614/s65_ilmar.taimre.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 671, "name": "Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 35511, "name": "Conceptual and post-conceptual art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conceptual_and_post-conceptual_art?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 257479, "name": "Art Rock", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_Rock?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 434939, "name": "Worldmaking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Worldmaking?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 833616, "name": "Conceptual Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conceptual_Music?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 846801, "name": "Bands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bands?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 872730, "name": "Postconceptual Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postconceptual_Art?f_ri=434939"}]}, {"id": 74717895, "title": "Glocality, Reflexivity, Interculturality, and Worldmaking: A Framework for Critical Global Teaching", "created_at": "2022-03-27T12:48:25.796-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/74717895/Glocality_Reflexivity_Interculturality_and_Worldmaking_A_Framework_for_Critical_Global_Teaching?f_ri=434939", "dom_id": "work_74717895", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82767081, "asset_id": 74717895, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 100285762, "first_name": "Sandi", "last_name": "Schneider", "domain_name": "radford", "page_name": "SandiSchneider", "display_name": "Sandi Schneider", "profile_url": "https://radford.academia.edu/SandiSchneider?f_ri=434939", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/100285762/28504315/26652136/s65_sandi.schneider.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3200, "name": "Praxis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Praxis?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5276, "name": "Reflexivity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reflexivity?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 77281, "name": "Decolonization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonization?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 106306, "name": "Interculturality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interculturality?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 213475, "name": "Crtitical Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Crtitical_Pedagogy?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 434939, "name": "Worldmaking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Worldmaking?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 446119, "name": "Childhood Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Childhood_Education?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 508371, "name": "Curriculum and Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curriculum_and_Pedagogy?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 713829, "name": "GLocality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/GLocality?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 2800707, "name": "Global Teacher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Teacher_Education?f_ri=434939"}]}, {"id": 31332916, "title": "Ca\u00efra O.

Late decades have brought the rise of a new generation of scholars who work through &quot;resistance politics&quot; approaches in pursuit of, for instance, social justice causes or posthumanist convictions. The purpose of this article (and its two companion articles in later issues of Tourism, Culture &amp;amp; Communication) is to capture the possibilities and the tensions in the development and cultivation of such &quot;disruptive&quot; or &quot;promiscuous&quot; research acts, and to conceptually situate them within Tourism Studies\u2014the domain that covers the &quot;worldmaking&quot;/&quot;declarative power&quot; of tourism to interpret and inscribe the peoples, places, pasts, and presents across the globe. In principally mining the neoteric and landmark text Disruptive Qualitative Inquiry (Brown, Carducci, and Kuby), an attempt is made to locate the interruptive craft of such unfolding disruptive thinking of and about tourism as rising numbers of Tourism Studies researchers themselves seek to decolonize their methodologies from the stranglehold of Western Modern Science and reverberate more positively with populations that have been subjugated or suppressed through tourism. In building up to the provision of a 30-term glossary (cumulatively provided across the said three companion articles) delineating the fresh thinking that is involved in such disruptive inquiry, this first article targets approaches that beckon forms of interpretive plural knowability, which demand the fluid acumen to map the less-fixed/fast-changeable populations of our time, and which are thereby decent yet rigorous in their critical multilogicality ; hence, this first article glossary covers terms such as &quot;reversing the binaries,&quot; &quot;promiscuous methodologies,&quot; and &quot;working the hyphens.&quot; In this innovative light, the second companion article glossary identifies conceptualizations such as &quot;guided wandering,&quot; &quot;postqualitative research,&quot; and &quot;survivance&quot; in order to expand the ontology and epistemology of Tourism Studies, while the glossary in the third article offers conceptualizations such as &quot;uncrossable methodolodies,&quot; &quot;helicopter research,&quot; and &quot;stuckness,&quot; which\u2014in their different ways\u2014speak to the transformative rhetorics of futurity for tourism and the peoples and places of the world.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 77964705, "asset_id": 66808487, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24232884, "first_name": "KEITH", "last_name": "HOLLINSHEAD", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "KEITHHOLLINSHEAD", "display_name": "KEITH HOLLINSHEAD", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/KEITHHOLLINSHEAD?f_ri=434939", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 909, "name": "Tourism Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism_Studies?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3115, "name": "Posthumanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Posthumanism?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7860, "name": "Cultural Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Tourism?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19197, "name": "Decolonialization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonialization?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 276111, "name": "Critical Tourism Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Tourism_Studies?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 394528, "name": "Disruption", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disruption?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 434939, "name": "Worldmaking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Worldmaking?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 707703, "name": "Politics of tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_tourism?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 852190, "name": "Unsettlement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Unsettlement?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 1709139, "name": "Postdisciplinarity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postdisciplinarity?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 4073262, "name": "Advanced Qualitative Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Advanced_Qualitative_Research?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 4073263, "name": "Dethinking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dethinking?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 4073264, "name": "Post Qualitative Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post_Qualitative_Research?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 4073265, "name": "Promiscuous Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Promiscuous_Research?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 4073266, "name": "Western Modern Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Western_Modern_Science?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 4073267, "name": "Deleuzian Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deleuzian_Thought?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 4073268, "name": "Plural Knowability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Plural_Knowability?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 4073269, "name": "Fluid Acumen", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fluid_Acumen?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 4073270, "name": "Critical Multilogicality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Multilogicality?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 4073271, "name": "New Sense", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Sense?f_ri=434939"}]}, {"id": 44818152, "title": "Kepekaan filologis untuk pengkajian budaya (Arps 2020)", "created_at": "2021-01-02T03:34:10.429-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44818152/Kepekaan_filologis_untuk_pengkajian_budaya_Arps_2020_?f_ri=434939", "dom_id": "work_44818152", "summary": "The author argues for the importance of a scholarly attitude and competence he terms philological sensitivity. Philology is usually associated with the study of manuscripts, where it is a sophisticated approach for making sense of texts. It entails a specific focus and mode of understanding. But the significance and utility of philology are not restricted to texts or manuscripts. Its scope is wider. Its approach is grounded in a cultural tendency that lives in society, namely the tendency to experience and try to understand five aspects of a cultural process or object: its artefactuality, apprehensibility, compositionality, contextuality, and historicity. If cultivated to meet the requirements of academic scholarship, this philological sensibility may form a perspective for understanding other kinds of artefacts too-especially if selectively enriched with elements from philological traditions worldwide. The author discusses examples from his own research: a manuscript with the narrative of Amir Hamza in Javanese, religious sermons in Osing on Youtube, and oral critique regarding shadow puppetry. \n\nAbstrak: Penulis mengemukakan pentingnya sebuah sikap dan keterampilan ilmiah yang disebutnya kepekaan filologis. Filologi lazim dihubungkan dengan studi naskah tulisan tangan, di mana filologi merupakan pendekatan canggih untuk mengapresiasi teks. Pendekatan tersebut membawa fokus dan cara pemahaman yang khas. Tetapi makna dan guna filologi tidak terbatas pada teks, apalagi naskah. Jangkauannya lebih luas. Pendekatan yang telah dikembangkan dalam rangka filologi teks itu berdasarkan kecenderungan kultural yang hidup di masyarakat, yaitu kecenderungan untuk menghayati dan memahami lima aspek dari sebuah proses atau benda budaya: keterbuatan, ketercerapan, ketersusunan, kontekstualitas dan kesejarahannya. Jika dipupuk sehingga memenuhi syarat ilmu pengetahuan, sensibilitas filologis tersebut bisa menjadi wawasan yang andal untuk pemahaman artefak budaya lain pula-apalagi kalau wawasan tersebut diperkaya dengan menyerap unsur-unsur terpilih dari tradisi filologi seantero dunia. Penulis mengutip contoh dari penelitiannya sendiri: naskah berisi ceritera Amir Hamzah berbahasa Jawa, ceramah agama Islam berbahasa Osing di Youtube, dan kritik lisan atas pertunjukan wayang..

G. Wells\u2019s semi-autobiographical novel, Tono-Bungay (1909), he recounts playing with the eighteenth-century dolls house at Uppark, a country estate in West Sussex where his mother was the housekeeper. Drawing on Nelson Goodman\u2019s Ways of Worldmaking (1978), I argue that Wells remakes his fictional worlds in Tono-Bungay and The Time Machine (1895) from the Uppark dolls house. To unpack the function and symbolism of the dolls house within Wells\u2019s texts, I refer to work by dolls house experts, cultural historians, and Wells scholars. When read together, Tono-Bungay and The Time Machine reveal the material dimensions and history of the dolls house that are at work in both novels. As a small-scale country house, the Uppark dolls house puts into perspective the antiquated paradigms that continue to exert control over the physical, social, and cultural landscapes of England. This is most clear when we consider the dolls house as an off-shoot of the curiosity cabinet, which evolves into the public museum \u2013 an evolution reflected in both novels. The dolls house, curiosity cabinet, and country house relate to the potent yet obsolete ideology of the microcosm, which Wells critiques explicitly in Tono- Bungay and implicitly in The Time Machine. The concept of play and the miniature are serious matters for Wells, who knows that small-scale objects can exert great influence on the \u2018real\u2019 world, clarifying and amplifying the material conditions that they model. Miniaturization is a high-stakes game \u2013 giving us the ability to control, comprehend, and remake our world into a rational paradigm.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63475288, "asset_id": 43206453, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17112823, "first_name": "Teresa", "last_name": "Trout", "domain_name": "harvard", "page_name": "TeresaTrout", "display_name": "Teresa Trout", "profile_url": "https://harvard.academia.edu/TeresaTrout?f_ri=434939", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/17112823/4706512/35113302/s65_teresa.trout.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 64740, "name": "The Time Machine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Time_Machine?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 64751, "name": "Tono-Bungay", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tono-Bungay?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 74897, "name": "Material Culture of the English Country House", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_of_the_English_Country_House?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 334855, "name": "History of Public Libraries and Museums", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Public_Libraries_and_Museums?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 399612, "name": "H.G.

Worldmakers poses an enormous question: How does the conception of the \" world \" change in early modernity? While the introduction and conclusion emphasize the ways rethinking that shift gives us new resources for thinking about the world now\u2014par-ticularly imperialism and secularism\u2014the book's impressive payoff lies in its new and often thrilling readings of a wide range of well-loved and much-studied early modern texts. Attending to metaphysics rather than mechanics, Ramachandran argues that early moderns turned to the imagination to meet the challenge of conceiving the newly available world as a whole rather than a motley collection of parts. \" Worldmaking is possible, even necessary, because of the insurmountable gap between our fragmentary apprehension of the phenomenal world and our desire for complete knowledge of it \" (10).

In chapter 1, \" Mapping the Body, Mapping the World: Mercator's Atlas , \" we meet our first worldmaker. Gerardus Mercator's maps, Rama-chandran argues, did not aspire merely to imitate the world but rather to explain it. Because visually representing the world on a map demanded a concurrent theoretical reevaluation of the structure of that world, Mercator's project was more cosmography than geography, metaphysical than practical. Furthermore, Mercator's desire to make sense of not just the world but also man's place in it brought his mapmaking into conversation with Vesalian anatomy: \" The redefinition of the world as a concep", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51621912, "asset_id": 31204900, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 858165, "first_name": "Jessie", "last_name": "Hock", "domain_name": "vanderbilt", "page_name": "JessieHock", "display_name": "Jessie  Hock", "profile_url": "https://vanderbilt.academia.edu/JessieHock?f_ri=434939", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/858165/306266/4895131/s65_jessie.hock.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2987, "name": "Renaissance Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Renaissance_Studies?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3581, "name": "Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poetry?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10474, "name": "Ren\u00e9 Descartes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11791, "name": "Early Modern Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Literature?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12762, "name": "Michel de Montaigne", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Michel_de_Montaigne?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 19253, "name": "John Milton", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/John_Milton?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 20058, "name": "Epic poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Epic_poetry?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 24322, "name": "Edmund Spenser", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Edmund_Spenser?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 26126, "name": "Montaigne", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Montaigne?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 28344, "name": "Lucretius", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lucretius?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 31353, "name": "Descartes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Descartes?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 35438, "name": "Cam\u00f5es", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Camoes?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 39312, "name": "Michel de Montaigne (Philosophy)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Michel_de_Montaigne_Philosophy_?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 434934, "name": "Luis Vaz de Cam\u00f5es", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Luis_Vaz_de_Camoes?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 434939, "name": "Worldmaking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Worldmaking?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 1736390, "name": "Gerardus Mercator", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gerardus_Mercator?f_ri=434939"}]}, {"id": 77228550, "title": "Scaling Down: H.

quasi-interchangeability of the words \u00bbculture\u00ab and \u00bbworld\u00ab (or \u00bbworldview\u00ab, \u00bbspiritual world\u00ab, etc.) in German philosophy of culture at the beginning of the 20th century has frequently been stressed. Can we infer from that the idea that this philosophy of culture could be described as a type of cosmology? This article argues for such an interpretation, reflecting on Georg Simmel's work, particularly his little known concept of \u00bbideal world\u00ab. Following this path, Simmel\u2019s relation to Kant and the Southwest School of Neo-Kantianism is analyzed.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43678725, "asset_id": 23190166, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 44979586, "first_name": "Matthieu", "last_name": "Amat", "domain_name": "unil", "page_name": "MatthieuAmat", "display_name": "Matthieu  Amat", "profile_url": "https://unil.academia.edu/MatthieuAmat?f_ri=434939", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/44979586/11947135/20913147/s65_matthieu.amat.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3497, "name": "Cosmology (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmology_Anthropology_?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14167, "name": "Philosophy of Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_Culture?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16031, "name": "Immanuel Kant", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immanuel_Kant?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27258, "name": "Georg Simmel", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Georg_Simmel?f_ri=434939", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65495, "name": "Kulturphilosophie", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kulturphilosophie?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 287683, "name": "Neokantianism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neokantianism?f_ri=434939"}, {"id": 434939, "name": "Worldmaking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Worldmaking?f_ri=434939"}]}]
