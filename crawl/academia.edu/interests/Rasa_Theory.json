After a detailed survey of the parts about rasas, sth\u0101yibh\u0101vas and abhinayas for head, eyes and neck it was possible to observe that the relationship is not as linear as it has been traditionally passed on.

However, Bhavabh\u016bti, bound by the laws of the dramatic genre, introduced such plot twists that the play ends happily with R\u0101ma and S\u012bt\u0101\u2019s reunion. Feller is concerned with the way in which Bhavabh\u016bti \u2018feminizes\u2019 the story, introducing a large number of female characters (some of them play very little or no role at all in the V\u0101lm\u012bki R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a), and with the reasons for this narrative strategy of \u2018feminization\u2019. Feller also observes that Bhavabh\u016bti was especially interested in the aesthetic experience, and promoting karu\u1e47a, the primary rasa in his play, was crucial to this work. He achieves this end thanks to the many female voices that not only allow themselves to manifest grief (\u015boka), but also because they allow the emergence of grief in the male characters, including R\u0101ma himself.\r\nhttps://crossasia-books.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/xasia/reader/download/530/530-43-88452-2-10-20200407.pdf", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65430418, "asset_id": 43253960, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4423818, "first_name": "Danielle", "last_name": "Feller", "domain_name": "unil", "page_name": "DanielleFeller", "display_name": "Danielle Feller", "profile_url": "https://unil.academia.edu/DanielleFeller?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4423818/15502606/16109151/s65_danielle.feller.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5076, "name": "Sanskrit language and literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sanskrit_language_and_literature?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 95666, "name": "Ramayana", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ramayana?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1212744, "name": "Theater", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theater-21?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 2512337, "name": "Bhavabhuti", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bhavabhuti?f_ri=763489"}]}, {"id": 14000089, "title": "Dimitrova, Zornitsa. 2015. \"Aesthetic Codification of the Unsavoury from Natyashastra and the Poetics to Postdramatic Theatre.\" NTQ 31 (4): 299-311.", "created_at": "2015-07-13T11:29:03.538-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14000089/Dimitrova_Zornitsa_2015_Aesthetic_Codification_of_the_Unsavoury_from_Natyashastra_and_the_Poetics_to_Postdramatic_Theatre_NTQ_31_4_299_311?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_14000089", "summary": "In examining the notion of entelechy \u2013 defined by Aristotle as the \u2018final cause\u2019 in drama \u2013 Zornitsa Dimitrova shows that depictions of \u2018unsavoury\u2019 content are only justified insofar as they are part of larger networks of aesthetic codification.

Yatra translates from Hindi as \"procession,\" and is used to refer to both religious and political variants, while shobha commonly translates as \"grace.\" The two terms together highlight the religious aspects of the procession and its place in the ritual calendar. The first public shobha yatra in Hyderabad occurred in 2010. Previously, it was a more relaxed affair that was celebrated in private. This change occurred in response to the Milad-un-Nabi celebrations of the Hyderabadi Muslim community becoming public for the first time in 2010, just a few weeks before that year's Ram Navami. 2 The last yatra I have information about is 2018.

Bharata(trans.1995) in Natyasastra has strongly argued that the ultimate sensation depends upon the emotion felt by the audience (as guided by the actors performance). Bharata believes that the relevant representation of the durable psychological states acts a stimulus in evoking in the spectator a verisimilitude of other psychological states that is then known as a Sentiment or Rasa. The role of the eight rasas is quite central to Indian cinema and its structure. It not only works to drive the plot and accentuate the behaviour of the characters, its function is deeply engraved in the basic storyline. Taking up the example of Bollywood, in this paper I would try to argue that every aspect Indian cinema comprising the performance of the actors, the technique of acting, the music, sangeet, background score and even the emotions produced by the audience, is based on Rasa and the aesthetic principles of Natyasastra.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36895734, "asset_id": 11323531, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4443238, "first_name": "International Journal of English Language", "last_name": "and Translation Studies", "domain_name": "eltsjournal", "page_name": "InternationalJournalofEnglishLanguageandTranslationStudies", "display_name": "International Journal of English Language  and Translation Studies", "profile_url": "https://eltsjournal.academia.edu/InternationalJournalofEnglishLanguageandTranslationStudies?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4443238/1814454/9010746/s65_international_journal_of_english_language.and_translation_studies.jpg"}, {"id": 4004026, "first_name": "Alisha", "last_name": "Ibkar", "domain_name": "amu-in", "page_name": "AlishaIbkar", "display_name": "Alisha Ibkar", "profile_url": "https://amu-in.academia.edu/AlishaIbkar?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4004026/1516999/8748400/s65_alisha.ibkar.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 928, "name": "Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Studies?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 934, "name": "Media and Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1555, "name": "Film Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Studies?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1568, "name": "Film Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Theory?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 3301, "name": "Film Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Analysis?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 3399, "name": "Documentary (Film Studies)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Documentary_Film_Studies_?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 6152, "name": "Applied Drama/Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Drama_Theatre?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 6222, "name": "Drama", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Drama?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 6223, "name": "English", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 7709, "name": "Applied Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Linguistics?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 13353, "name": "Indian English Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_English_Literature?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 25107, "name": "Film Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Aesthetics?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 41435, "name": "Indian Writing in English", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Writing_in_English?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 42298, "name": "Film and Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_and_Media_Studies?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 43776, "name": "Movies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Movies?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 89886, "name": "Natyasastra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Natyasastra?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 122013, "name": "Asthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asthetics?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 170908, "name": "Indian Cinema, Bollywood, Film Studies, South Asia, Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Cinema_Bollywood_Film_Studies_South_Asia_Media?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489"}]}, {"id": 42626041, "title": "Idealised Sexualities in Rajput Miniature Paintings of Rasikapriya", "created_at": "2020-04-05T04:07:11.967-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42626041/Idealised_Sexualities_in_Rajput_Miniature_Paintings_of_Rasikapriya?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_42626041", "summary": "Idealized sexuality is a prominent theme in the poetry and paintings of Rasikapriy\u0101.  It\u2019s author Ke\u015bavad\u0101sa uses this subject as means for illuminating his theory on the concept of love underlined with the religious philosophy of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avism. Ke\u015bavad\u0101sa emphasizes on \u015b\u1e5b\u1e45g\u0101ra rasa, the erotic sentiment based on the emotion of love, as the prime rasa of Rasikapriy\u0101. Through the aid of theory of \u015b\u1e5b\u1e45g\u0101ra rasa he brings to forefront discussions on sexuality. He identifies K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the romantic hero, the n\u0101yaka \u2013 the god who is also a lover. And he builds an index of three hundred and sixty n\u0101yik\u0101s, representing female sexuality in almost all its aspects. \r\n\r\nThe concept of love in Rasikapriy\u0101 can be understood in three categories \u2013 firstly as the poetic theory of \u015b\u1e5b\u1e45g\u0101ra rasa, which is an aesthetic experience; secondly as kama\u015b\u0101stra i.e. the knowledge of the arts of lovemaking; and thirdly as devotional bhakti philosophy, which is a spiritual experience. Ke\u015bavad\u0101sa blends these three aspects of love into a beautiful rendition in his poetry. Through these aspects Ke\u015bavad\u0101sa provides a symbolic expression to an idealized realm of a loving relationship between the idealized n\u0101yaka and n\u0101yik\u0101. Ke\u015bavad\u0101sa portrays them not only as youthful, handsome and renouncing, but more importantly adept in the arts of lovemaking, emphasizing their sexuality.\r\n\r\nWhat Rasikapriy\u0101 represents has the vividness or convincing quality of appearing to belong to reality, though not imitatively reproducing the actual world of experience or theory. This symbolism when translated into the R\u0101jput miniature paintings, presents a plethora of images with a vivid visual portrayal of love and sexuality. They render the poetry of Rasikapriy\u0101 into a visual medium, which transform nature into an ideal imaginary world expressing a deep-rooted philosophy of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avism. Their art metaphorically renders the ideas of bhakti, which stresses upon the realization of the pure element of consciousness i.e. the self in a man. This process is about experiencing human-life in its fullest extent and engaging in a passionate and ceaseless love for the Lord, which is as pure and obsessive as natural love between two humans. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 69682252, "asset_id": 42626041, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 48744558, "first_name": "Chetan", "last_name": "Chhiller", "domain_name": "auckland", "page_name": "ChetanChhiller", "display_name": "Chetan Chhiller", "profile_url": "https://auckland.academia.edu/ChetanChhiller?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/48744558/19772309/34073082/s65_chetan.chhiller.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3369, "name": "Religion and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Sexuality?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10934, "name": "Vaishnavism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vaishnavism?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14998, "name": "Gender and Sexuality Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality_Studies?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21003, "name": "Sexuality And Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexuality_And_Culture?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 24047, "name": "Indian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Art?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 49663, "name": "Women and Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_Gender_Studies?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 93708, "name": "Persian and Indian Miniature Painting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persian_and_Indian_Miniature_Painting?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 110012, "name": "Indian Archaeology and History of Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Archaeology_and_History_of_Art?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 131427, "name": "Krishna", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Krishna?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 198052, "name": "Rasa and bhakti", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_and_bhakti?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 231392, "name": "Poetry and Painting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poetry_and_Painting?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 779328, "name": "Indian Painting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Painting?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 851166, "name": "Rajput painting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rajput_painting?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 851168, "name": "Mewar painting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mewar_painting?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 980696, "name": "Dhvani and Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dhvani_and_Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 2216469, "name": "Keshavdas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Keshavdas?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 3610880, "name": "rasikapriya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/rasikapriya?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 3610881, "name": "nayika bheda", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/nayika_bheda?f_ri=763489"}]}, {"id": 41292790, "title": "ESTETIKA SENI INDIA", "created_at": "2019-12-13T20:05:35.588-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41292790/ESTETIKA_SENI_INDIA?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_41292790", "summary": "India merupakan salah satu Negara yang terkenal dengan kebudayaannya yang unik dan berbeda dengan bangsa lainya.

be it performance or static art.  Rasa, in Indian context, applied to both the performer and the audience is considered an alaukika (other worldly) experience.  An integral part of aesthetics both Indian and Greek (although European performing arts moved away from the original concept of Greek aesthetics) is improvisation on the rules that are suggested for a clear structure, which by definition is fluid and allows room for \u2018newness. Using Bharat Gupt\u2019s study of the poetics and Natyashastra, this paper will focus on similarities in both Indian and Greek aesthetics, also highlighting when and why contemporary notion of aesthetics in European theatre moved away from the Greek, which was more similar to the Indian sensibility.  There will also be a focus on the concept of hieropraxis (art as worship, pleasing both people and Gods), which was common, both to Indian and Greek art forms.  Finally, the paper will illustrate through examples of Bollywood and interviews with BharatNatyam teachers (in Sweden) how improvisation, and newness is brought into various aspects of performance arts, thereby challenging Sheldon Pollock\u2019s reading of the Natyashastra, as being rigid and frozen in time and devoid of bringing novelty, making them irrelevant to our times.  \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58948935, "asset_id": 38852171, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6511255, "first_name": "Charu", "last_name": "Uppal", "domain_name": "gu-se", "page_name": "CharuUppal", "display_name": "Charu Uppal", "profile_url": "https://gu-se.academia.edu/CharuUppal?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6511255/13083500/14410845/s65_charu.uppal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 19739, "name": "Bollywood (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bollywood_Anthropology_?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 94916, "name": "Indology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indology?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 303463, "name": "Bharata Natyashastra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bharata_Natyashastra?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 373350, "name": "Sheldon Pollock", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sheldon_Pollock?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 3205009, "name": "Swadeshi Indology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Swadeshi_Indology?f_ri=763489"}]}, {"id": 36377218, "title": "NARRATIVE THEORY  full text temporarily available", "created_at": "2018-04-10T09:23:58.255-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36377218/NARRATIVE_THEORY_full_text_temporarily_available?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_36377218", "summary": "The narrative mode of world-representation and world-building is omnipresent and far exceeds the domain of literature. Since literature is not necessarily narrative and narrative not necessarily literary, the study of narrative in a literary context must confront narrative and literature in a dual way: How does the presence of narrative affect literature? And how does literariness affect narrative? The basic terminology needs to be clarified by comparing English with the vocabulary of other natural languages. No consensus has been reached, even in the West, on the nature of narrative discourse. The entire history of poetics shows that, before the middle of the 20th century, little attention was paid to the narrative components of literary texts qua narrative\u2014that is, insofar as the same narrative elements could equally be found in non-aestheticized uses of verbal and non-verbal languages. Aristotelian poetics, based on the mimesis of human action, keeps its grip on narrative theory. The post-Aristotelian triad separated more sharply the lyric from the epic and dramatic genres, but modern narrative theories, mostly based on the study of folk tales and the novel, have still failed to unify the field of literary narrative, or have done it artificially, dissolving narrative discourse into the undifferentiated experience of human life in linear time. The Western \" rise of the novel, \" in Ian Watt's sense, and its worldwide expansion, turned the question of fiction, not that of narrativity, into the main focus of narrative studies. Later, the emergence of formalism and semiotics and the \" linguistic turn \" of the social sciences pushed the narrative analysis of literary texts in the opposite direction, with all of its efforts bearing on minimal, supposedly deeper units and simple concatenations. The permanent, unresolved conflict between an analytical and constructivist view grounded in individual events and a holistic view concerned with story-worlds and storytelling leaves mostly unattended such fundamental questions as how narrative is used by literature and literature by narrative for their own ends.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56286974, "asset_id": 36377218, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 196955, "first_name": "Didier", "last_name": "COSTE", "domain_name": "u-bordeaux3", "page_name": "DidierCOSTE", "display_name": "Didier COSTE", "profile_url": "https://u-bordeaux3.academia.edu/DidierCOSTE?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/196955/90989/98965/s65_didier.coste.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2852, "name": "Narrative", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4490, "name": "Cognitive Narratology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cognitive_Narratology?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5513, "name": "Narratology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narratology?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18880, "name": "Narrative Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative_Analysis?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19818, "name": "Narrative Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative_Theory?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 23505, "name": "Visual Narratology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Narratology?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 34169, "name": "Narrative Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative_Art?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 48173, "name": "Narrativity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrativity?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 51014, "name": "Genres of discourse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genres_of_discourse?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 78334, "name": "Narratolog\u00eda", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narratolog%C3%ADa?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 95451, "name": "Indian Literary Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Literary_Theory?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 175109, "name": "Literary Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_Aesthetics?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 209618, "name": "Narratologie", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narratologie?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 380796, "name": "Aesthetics, Literary Theory and Narratology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aesthetics_Literary_Theory_and_Narratology?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 1185647, "name": "Fludernik's Natural Narratology and Cognitive Parameters", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fluderniks_Natural_Narratology_and_Cognitive_Parameters?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 1216460, "name": "Narrativit\u00e9", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrativite?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 2277930, "name": "Th\u00e9ories Du R\u00e9cit", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Th%C3%A9ories_Du_R%C3%A9cit?f_ri=763489"}]}, {"id": 45580673, "title": "Rasa - The Aesthetics of Sentiments", "created_at": "2021-03-19T05:28:14.614-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45580673/Rasa_The_Aesthetics_of_Sentiments?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_45580673", "summary": "Rasa plays a very prominent role in performing arts.

"work_66692688", "summary": "This is a brief review of the Rasa theory of Indian aesthetics and the works I have done on the same. A major source of the Indian system of classification of emotional states comes from the \u2018Natyasastra\u2019, the ancient Indian treatise on the performing arts, which dates back to the 2nd Century AD (or much earlier, pg. LXXXVI:  Natyasastra, Ghosh, 1951). The \u2018Natyasastra\u2019 speaks about \u2018sentiments\u2019 or \u2018Rasas\u2019 (pg.102:  Natyasastra, Ghosh, 1951) which are produced when certain \u2018dominant states\u2019 (sthayi Bhava), \u2018transitory states\u2019 (vyabhicari Bhava) and \u2018temperamental states\u2019 (sattvika Bhava) of emotions come together (pgs.102, 105:  Natyasastra, Ghosh, 1951).  This Rasa theory, which is still widely followed in classical Indian performing arts, classifies eight Rasas or sentiments which are: Sringara (erotic), Hasya (comic), Karuna (pathetic), Raudra (furious), Vira (heroic), Bhayanaka (terrible), Bibhatsa (odious) and Adbhuta (marvellous). There was a later addition of the ninth sentiment or Rasa called Santa (peace) in later Sanskrit poetics (pg.102:  Natyasastra, Ghosh, 1951). According to ancient Indian aesthetics (especially in the context of Bharatas\u2019 \u2018Natyasastra\u2019, Anandavardhana\u2019s \u2018Dhvanyaloka\u2019 and Abhinavagupta\u2019s \u2018Abhinavabharati\u2019), \u2018Rasa\u2019 is the relishable state of elemental human emotions called \u2018Bhavas\u2019. Bharata\u2019s \u2018Natyasastra\u2019 originally spoke of eight Rasas. The concept of the 9th Rasa was a later interpolation by the Kashmiri Shaivist Abhinavagupta (10th Century AD) and also his predecessor Anandavardhana (9th Century AD). Abhinavagupta extends the eight Rasas by adding the concept of the Santa Rasa which he regards as the essence of all Rasas. It is this 9th Rasa which according to Abhinavagupta lets the Rasika attain the aesthetic detachment and savour the essences of all other Rasas and therefore the true aesthetic delight. The introduction of 9th Rasa integrates the concepts of Bharata\u2019s Rasasutra and Patanjali\u2019s Yoga theory \u2013 the detachment necessary to introspect inwards into the inherent state of freedom and bliss (aesthetic consciousness).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 92649472, "asset_id": 66692688, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4856183, "first_name": "Dyutiman", "last_name": "Mukhopadhyay", "domain_name": "manipal", "page_name": "DrDyutimanMukhopadhyayPhDMScAdvDipFA", "display_name": "Dyutiman Mukhopadhyay", "profile_url": "https://manipal.academia.edu/DrDyutimanMukhopadhyayPhDMScAdvDipFA?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4856183/2081014/82339430/s65_dr._dyutiman.mukhopadhyay_phd_msc_advdipfa.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 49411, "name": "Indian Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Aesthetics?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 89886, "name": "Natyasastra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Natyasastra?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 45572938, "title": "Therapeutic Healing through Dance", "created_at": "2021-03-18T01:05:38.819-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45572938/Therapeutic_Healing_through_Dance?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_45572938", "summary": "The purpose of the paper is to emphasize Dance as a mode of healing. Since ages, Dance has been helpful to us in various capacities.   Since ancient times it is used as a medium of communication, entertainment, spirituality \u2013 as an offering to Gods and so on. Dance, since its origin has undergone many developments and today, its knowledge is imparted in academics at various levels ranging from Certificate programmees to PhD programmee.   Individuals are opting and practicing Dance either as profession or as a hobby and various other options. Today, in the contemporary era, Dance is viewed and treated differently as it has various other benefits. One among them is the healing capabilities. With the ingenious thoughts of Marian Chace \u2013 The grand Dame of Dance Therapy, Dance is witnessed as a medium of Therapy besides communication and entertainment. Me, being an Indian origin, and practicing Dance since more than 3 decades, would like to correlate the origin of Dance in general to the origin of Dance Therapy in particular, according to Indian mythology. According to Hindu mythology, Dance has been created by Lord Brahma to heal the illness (bad deeds, misery, jealousy, exploitation etc) of the humans on the earth and bring them back to a systematic life. Hence, I feel the reason for the origin of Dance itself is with a therapeutic motive. It clearly justifies that practicing and implementing Dance has various other benefits besides entertainment. Dance has always been as a means of communication and entertainment till nineteenth century. Subsequently, Dance is being perceived and viewed into various other means and approaches to spread its wings and branches. Dance is analysed, substantiated and proved into various disciplines and forms to manifest its efficiency besides entertainment. In this context, Dance is witnessed as a mode of Therapy from 1920 onwards by Marian Chace, the lady behind the concept of Dance Therapy. The present paper is a modest attempt to highlight the importance of Dance; and to bring in and establish the concept of Dance Therapy, its origin and evolution, while enlightening its significance.

This conventional interpretation of an aesthetic theory first articulated in the Natyashastra suggests the actor does not experience pleasure or rasa, and by implication, the actor's craft is primarily in the service of the audience's pleasure. If, on the other hand, the actor does taste rasa, as evidenced by Pollock (2016) through Krishnamoorthy's (1979) interpretation of the Natyashastra, then, contrary to the conventional understanding, a transfer of this ability from guru or master practitioner to learner, is at the heart of its actor training pedagogy. To transfer this very specific skill full ability, the master practitioner's actions need to be imitated precisely and not interpreted. The dominant western academic narrative of Kathakali's imitative pedagogy represents it as \"mimicking\", a quality for low, and specially not of the high arts. A renegotiating of the idea of mimicry with a more complex and nuanced \"mirroring,\" offers up fertile conceptual ground for an investigation into its offerings of rasa. Practice-led research conducted by the practitioner researcher as part of his doctoral thesis exploring the teaching of Kathakali in Australia, offers original theoretical and practical insights into a transfer of rasa from master practitioner to learner, at the site of intercultural actor training.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59108698, "asset_id": 39001238, "asset_type": "Work",

indologico\nTESI DI DIPLOMA ACCADEMICO DI II LIVELLO\nRelatore: Chiar.mo Prof. Roberto PERINU\nCandidato: Paolo FALLILONE (matricola n\u00b0 4174)\n\nMentre, in Occidente, i grandi filosofi greci dell'epoca classica ragionavano sul senso del bello nell'arte, in India, nello stesso periodo, si andava sviluppando quello che, in seguito, sarebbe divenuto il maggior contributo dei pensatori ind\u00f9 nel campo dell'estetica: la teoria del rasa. Tale teoria, che appare all'interno del N\u0101\u1e6dya\u015b\u0101stra di Bharata Muni, il testo fondamentale sull'arte del teatro risalente ai primi secoli dell'era cristiana, si fonda sull\u2019attribuzione di un\u2019importanza basilare al responso emotivo dello spettatore di una rappresentazione artistica. In tal modo, il fine dell'opera non diventa la pura e semplice rappresentazione del bello o l'esaltazione della perfezione delle forme ma, viceversa, ha uno scopo di tipo etico. Il fruitore competente \u00e8 in grado, attraverso la gustazione estetica del rasa, di annullare la divisione tra soggetto e oggetto della percezione, e di identificarsi nell'Assoluto, il Brahman, liberandosi, anche solo per un fugace istante, dalla consapevolezza dell'ineluttabilit\u00e0 del sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, l'inarrestabile ciclo delle morti e rinascite. La musica indiana, attraverso il sembiante del r\u0101ga, l'archetipo sonoro sul quale si fonda la teoria classica, non si sottrae al compito che la tradizione ha assegnato all'arte. Grazie a un corpus di regole vasto e raffinato, i teorici indiani della musica hanno strutturato il loro pensare entro una dimensione prettamente emozionale e lo hanno condensato nell'esperienza trascendente che hanno definito rasa.\n\nWhile, in the West, the great Greek philosophers of the Classical Age were thinking about the sense of beauty in art, in India, in the same period, what would have later become the greatest contribution made by the Hindu thinkers in the aesthetics field was developing: the rasa theory.\nSuch theory, that can be found in the N\u0101\u1e6dya\u015b\u0101stra by Bharata Muni, the fundamental text as far as the art of drama is concerned, dating back to the first centuries of the Christian Age, is based on the attribution of a basic importance to the emotional response of the audience during an\nartistic performance. In so doing, the aim of the work is not the pure and simple representation of beauty or the glorification of perfect forms, but, on the contrary, it has a specific ethical purpose. The most cultured of audiences, through the aesthetic tasting of the rasa, are able to\nannul the division between the subject and the object of the perception, and to identify themselves with the Absolute, the Brahman, freeing themselves, even if only for a transient moment, from the awareness of the ineluctability of the sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, the ever lasting cycle of death\nand rebirth. Indian music, by means of the semblance of r\u0101ga, the sonorous archetype on which the classic theory is founded, does not back out of the task the tradition has assigned to art.\nThanks to a wide and refined corpus of rules, the Indian music theorists have structured their thought within a purely emotional dimension and have condensed it in the transcendent experience they have called rasa.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63264407, "asset_id": 43001191, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 131551332, "first_name": "Paolo", "last_name": "Fallilone", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "PaoloFallilone", "display_name": "Paolo Fallilone", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/PaoloFallilone?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/131551332/44150898/34852167/s65_paolo.fallilone.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 66376, "name": "Indian Classical Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Classical_Music?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 89886, "name": "Natyasastra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Natyasastra?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1197760, "name": "MUSICA INDIANA", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/MUSICA_INDIANA?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44109654, "title": "BHAKTI IN THE J\u012aVA: INHERENT OR INHERITED?

Abhinaya evokes pleasure and sensuality in multiple, ambiguous ways towards the goal of evoking rasa, ideally the audience\u2019s experience of emotional-spiritual transcendence.\nWe investigate tactical cross-overs between the strategies of autobiography and abhinaya in D\u2019Lo\u2019s and Post Natyam\u2019s work: how do they interact, where might they exclude each other, and what kind of performance of queerness emerges through their interplay?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36925735, "asset_id": 11354227, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3847404, "first_name": "Cynthia Ling", "last_name": "Lee", "domain_name": "ucsc", "page_name": "CynthiaLingLee", "display_name": "Cynthia Ling  Lee", "profile_url": "https://ucsc.academia.edu/CynthiaLingLee?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3847404/1410683/17569569/s65_cynthia_ling.lee.jpg"}, {"id": 267916, "first_name": "Sandra", "last_name": "Chatterjee", "domain_name": "independentresearcher", "page_name": "SandraChatterjee", "display_name": "Sandra Chatterjee", "profile_url": "https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/SandraChatterjee?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/267916/65831/72460/s65_sandra.chatterjee.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 699, "name": "Queer Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Studies?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1556, "name": "Dance Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dance_Studies?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2337, "name": "Performance Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance_Studies?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3114, "name": "Queer Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Theory?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 7297, "name": "Autobiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Autobiography?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 9043, "name": "Performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 29167, "name": "Dance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dance?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489"}]}, {"id": 79897455, "title": "[Concept Note] Musings: Why I study aesthetics: an unwritten essay.", "created_at": "2022-05-25T07:08:55.200-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/79897455/_Concept_Note_Musings_Why_I_study_aesthetics_an_unwritten_essay?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_79897455", "summary": "The musings are based upon Kashmiri Shaivist Abhinavagupta\u2019s concept of Santa Rasa (10th Century AD) and my Advait beliefs stemmed from the Upanishads.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 92784204, "asset_id": 79897455, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4856183, "first_name": "Dyutiman", "last_name": "Mukhopadhyay", "domain_name": "manipal", "page_name": "DrDyutimanMukhopadhyayPhDMScAdvDipFA", "display_name": "Dyutiman Mukhopadhyay", "profile_url": "https://manipal.academia.edu/DrDyutimanMukhopadhyayPhDMScAdvDipFA?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4856183/2081014/82339430/s65_dr._dyutiman.mukhopadhyay_phd_msc_advdipfa.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 25218, "name": "Advaita Vedanta", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Advaita_Vedanta?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 80556, "name": "Upanishads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Upanishads?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 148229, "name": "Religion and Art, Sanskrit Studies, Sanskrit Aesthetics, Indian Philosophy, Indian Music, Dance and Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Art_Sanskrit_Studies_Sanskrit_Aesthetics_Indian_Philosophy_Indian_Music_Dance_and_?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 729470, "name": "Kashmir Shaivism, Sanskrit language, Abhinavagupta", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kashmir_Shaivism_Sanskrit_language_Abhinavagupta?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 1823387, "name": "Santa Rasa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Santa_Rasa?f_ri=763489"}]}, {"id": 73698574, "title": "Aesthetic Affect of Anger: Omair Ahmad's Jimmy the Terrorist and the Possibilities in Raudra Rasa", "created_at": "2022-03-13T19:23:40.650-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/73698574/Aesthetic_Affect_of_Anger_Omair_Ahmads_Jimmy_the_Terrorist_and_the_Possibilities_in_Raudra_Rasa?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_73698574", "summary": "This paper aims to examine the dimensions of aesthetic affect of anger in the rasa framework in Indian aesthetics. In the postmodern times, as aesthetic emotions are formulated (packaged and predetermined) and with the digital accessibility of new media, the reader/viewer's engagement as proposed in rasa framework becomes relevant and helps to contextualize the debate on what is the nature of art and the aesthetic process itself. To expound on these concerns, this paper reads Omair Ahmad's novel Jimmy the Terrorist (2010) and a particular incident in the narrative to understand the emotion of krodha (anger) and the affective process leading to the protagonist's behavioural and active response. The aesthetic framework referred to is Bharata's treatise on dramaturgy The N\u0101\u1e6dya\u015b\u0101stra and the interpretations offered by Abhinavagupta with some references to \u015aankuka's views. In contemporary postmodern aesthetics, these concerns are important as they point to the need for contextualizing the psychological makeup of readers/ spectators which is an integral part of the aesthetic process itself.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82117804, "asset_id": 73698574, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 526555, "first_name": "Namrata", "last_name": "Chaturvedi", "domain_name": "zakirhusaindelhicollege", "page_name": "NamrataChaturvedi", "display_name": "Namrata Chaturvedi", "profile_url": "https://zakirhusaindelhicollege.academia.edu/NamrataChaturvedi?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/526555/16627843/77447709/s65_namrata.chaturvedi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 17330, "name": "Affect Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Theory?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 49411, "name": "Indian Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Aesthetics?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 38903530, "title": "\"From Rasa Seen to Rasa Heard\": A Criticism", "created_at": "2019-04-23T05:16:39.786-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38903530/_From_Rasa_Seen_to_Rasa_Heard_A_Criticism?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_38903530", "summary": "This is a critical take at Prof. Sheldon Pollock's paper \"From Rasa Seen to Rasa Heard\".

Performance of khay\u0101l provides scope to the vocalist to establish a mood centred on particular emotions through a r\u0101ga melody and a bandish. The audiences who partake in experiencing khay\u0101l performance feel the methodical application of different ingredients of r\u0101ga melody by vocalists, indulging in tasting the rasas evoked in the senses. Rigorous studies have been undertaken by musicians and scholars of classical music from the perspective of notational systems, empirical analysis of r\u0101gas and socio-cultural interpretation of the emergence of different genres but critical engagement in analysing aesthetics of North Indian music has been rare. This paper explores causes of arousal of rasa experiences in connoisseurs of khay\u0101l. The methodology is to understand the relation between r\u0101gas and rasas and the connection of bandishes of khay\u0101l with rasas. It attempts to understand the attributes of a rasika or a connoisseur under the framework of rasa theory by discussing a rasika\u2019s journey of assimilation into khay\u0101l\u2019s aesthetics.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 72330988, "asset_id": 57414369, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 71585034, "first_name": "Barnashree", "last_name": "Khasnobis", "domain_name": "kristujayanti", "page_name": "BarnashreeKhasnobis", "display_name": "Barnashree Khasnobis", "profile_url": "https://kristujayanti.academia.edu/BarnashreeKhasnobis?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/71585034/19749054/30928398/s65_barnashree.khasnobis.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 671, "name": "Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7125, "name": "Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9721, "name": "Music Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music_Aesthetics?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24057, "name": "Indian Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Culture?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 256667, "name": "Arts and Humanities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arts_and_Humanities?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 601031, "name": "Hindustani classical music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hindustani_classical_music?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 3618391, "name": "Bandish", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bandish?f_ri=763489"}]}, {"id": 45197861, "title": "MUSIC IN TEMPLES OF KHAJURAHO(WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO LAKSHMAN TEMPLE AT KHAJURAHO)", "created_at": "2021-02-25T22:31:41.165-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45197861/MUSIC_IN_TEMPLES_OF_KHAJURAHO_WITH_SPECIAL_REFERENCE_TO_LAKSHMAN_TEMPLE_AT_KHAJURAHO_?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_45197861", "summary": "Music is the most prominent way to express inner voice.

This reduces customer interaction time with websites, thereby valuing their time and improving their overall experience. As part of this project, we explored and attempted to create an intelligent chatbot that could extract relevant information, recognize various intents and execute the pre-mapped actions. To create a contextual assistant for the above purpose, we used the RASA framework. To train the model, we constructed a custom dataset that includes multiple intents and entities. Additionally, we provide some python scripts (RASA actions) that will be executed when some intents are detected. Our solution consisted of creating a pipeline having a chatbot and several actions triggered by the chatbot. These actions will connect with the database and then provide the required data or make changes according to the user's query and display the feedback back to the user via the chat widget.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 85453321, "asset_id": 78387286, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6079060, "first_name": "IJRASET", "last_name": "Publication", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "IJRASETPublication", "display_name": "IJRASET Publication", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/IJRASETPublication?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6079060/2549300/33111525/s65_ijraset.publication.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17832, "name": "Python", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Python?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 246160, "name": "Chatbot", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chatbot?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1172324, "name": "Smart Banking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Smart_Banking?f_ri=763489"}]}, {"id": 20146789, "title": "O Dharma Art\u00edstico como um Reatualizar da Cosmogonia: elementos da po\u00e9tica da tradi\u00e7\u00e3o de Bharatamuni", "created_at": "2016-01-10T16:28:16.080-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/20146789/O_Dharma_Art%C3%ADstico_como_um_Reatualizar_da_Cosmogonia_elementos_da_po%C3%A9tica_da_tradi%C3%A7%C3%A3o_de_Bharatamuni?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_20146789", "summary": "Abordo, no presente texto, algo j\u00e1 trabalhado antes, contudo incorporando novas quest\u00f5es advindas do trabalho de pesquisa, adaptando a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o para um contexto mais did\u00e1tico.

Readers of different countries, culture, religions, ideologies, passions and prejudices do appreciate and relish literature of altogether a different place as it provides aesthetic enjoyment to them. A close conspicuous analysis of the available literature may expound the fact that the most fascinating area of intersection between Indian and Western literature is to be found in the realm of poetics and aesthetics. James joyce\u2019s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man vis an example of German philosophy of Bildungsroman which deals with the formation of an artist, it traces the journey of Being, Becoming and Unbecoming of an individual, wherein an individual passes through the socio-pragmatic as well as aesthetico-spiritual realm of realities. In the conduit of aforementioned realities, an individual passes through a number of emotions, sentiments and feelings which in turn shape the epistemic texture of the character. The problem that confronts a critic is to find out how in a work of art, an emotion is depicted, suggested and how it is finally communicated to the reader. In the realm of Indian aesthetics, the key to any analysis of aesthetic transformation is the theory of Rasa. The Rasa Theory essentially deals with various kinds of emotions and how they are depicted, inferred and transmitted through a work of art. Thus, the present paper shall take into account philosophical underpinnings of Rasa Theory in order to analyze the given novel. \r\n\r\nKeywords: Indian aesthetics, Rasa theory, Bildungsroman.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 77645055, "asset_id": 46457105, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 76809345, "first_name": "Madhurantika", "last_name": "Sunil", "domain_name": "patnawomenscollege", "page_name": "MadhurantikaSunil", "display_name": "Madhurantika Sunil", "profile_url": "https://patnawomenscollege.academia.edu/MadhurantikaSunil?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/76809345/19142526/19764796/s65_madhurantika.sunil.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6223, "name": "English", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 49411, "name": "Indian Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Aesthetics?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 143019, "name": "Bildungsroman", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bildungsroman?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 42144868, "title": "Rasa-An Immanent Transcendence", "created_at": "2020-03-05T05:55:37.963-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42144868/Rasa_An_Immanent_Transcendence?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_42144868", "summary": "Sitting in his nightgown by his fire, contemplating what exactly it means to be a human being, Descartes developed an idea that has indelibly constructed the worldviews of all those steeped in the Western philosophical tradition and the cultures it has helped to form. Descartes understood himself dualistically, split between the disembodied mental substance doing the thinking and the bodied physical substance where all other aspects of human life were relegated. This split between the mental and physical aspects of personhood took on ontological meaning as Descartes located the essence of personhood in the disembodied mental substance. 2 The physical, bodied, was now merely \"worldly,\" that which would pass away; and to the disembodied mental substance, Descartes ascribed an eternal essence, giving it less a transcendence in relation to the physical world than a fundamentally distinct nature. 3 This split engendered a dualistic conception of the universe-a disembodied, spiritual, transcendent realm and a bodied, physical, inevitably decaying realm. And for those of us steeped in the patterns of thought that rise in his wake, our Cartesian inheritance has left us with a fundamental dualism between all matters spiritual and all matters physical. In Philosophy in the Flesh, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson reexamine Descartes' logic and, despite its considerable influence, find its foundations faulty. Instead, they build a philosophy based on a wholly bodied definition of personhood and situate the human experience entirely within the body and the body's interactions with the world.

Neither imitation nor art, performance is a dual experience between the performer and the spectator. Over time in India, differing interpretations of this dual performance experience came to be formulated by four major \"schools of thought.\" In her book, Dr. Parham Chin introduces the eleven structural parts of performance. She then explains the meaning of rasa as interpreted by the four major \"schools\" and offers her own interpretation of what she calls the \" performance experience \" (rasa.)

Numerous ancient Indian texts dwell on the complex sphere of human response to various revelations of beauty and divine presence in the world whether expressed in the material form, through sound, devotional poetry or realized on stage in theatrical performance. The arrangement of the ritual and the adoration of gods was itself deeply rooted in the field of emotional engagement and presupposed a very nuanced system of possible reactions and feelings of the devotees from a mere contemplation via an ecstatic state of rasa to the experience of supreme love towards a personal god (bhakti). This conference is the first attempt to analyze this complex way of human interaction with the divine in Hinduism based on various forms of emotional engagement, which is not limited to the contemporary and profane understanding of senses. The papers presented at the conference will cover a wide range of topics and approach the general theme of religious empathy from different perspectives: material culture, textual evidence, literature, ritual, sacred imagery, iconography, and theatrical performance.

The multi-layered nature of a socio-religious ritual performance lends itself to two main conceptual frameworks. The first is the aesthetic criterion of order and place that is embedded in the collective memory of the audience. The second is the experience of shared aesthetics among community members who are immersed in the performance. The theory of Rasa in Indian traditions of thought affords itself to the explanation of such a cognitive movement during ritual performance that is coconstituted by socio-religious symbolism as well as an aesthetic display.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 202203932, "first_name": "Meera", "last_name": "Baindur", "domain_name": "rvu", "page_name": "MBaindur", "display_name": "Meera Baindur", "profile_url": "https://rvu.academia.edu/MBaindur?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/202203932/63382359/51687611/s65_meera.baindur.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2858, "name": "Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Culture?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4058, "name": "Ritual", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ritual?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16827, "name": "Asian Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Theatre?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 152388, "name": "Art Theory and Criticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_Theory_and_Criticism?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 236505, "name": "Tulu Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tulu_Language?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 337387, "name": "Aestehtics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aestehtics?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 373163, "name": "Ritual Practices", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ritual_Practices?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489"}]}, {"id": 28237591, "title": "Call for Participation - Rasa Workshop (February 13-17, 2017)", "created_at": "2016-09-04T03:23:22.593-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28237591/Call_for_Participation_Rasa_Workshop_February_13_17_2017_?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_28237591", "summary": "There have been a number of attempts at editing and translating the text of the N\u0101\u1e6dya\u015b\u0101stra and Abhinavabh\u0101rat\u012b, including most recently Professor K.D. Tripathi\u2019s first volume of the N\u0101\u1e6dya\u015b\u0101stra (2015) and a selection of translations included in Professor S. Pollock\u2019s Rasa Reader (2016). Despite a relatively long history of scholarly engagement, however, much about this tradition remains poorly understood, and the texts themselves remain very difficult to establish conclusively: both texts are technical, and to add to this, the N\u0101\u1e6dya\u015b\u0101stra is available in widely-divergent forms in several families of manuscripts, while the Abhinavabh\u0101rat\u012b is available only in a highly corrupt form in a single family of manuscripts.\n\nThis workshop will principally include a close textual reading of selections from the Ras\u0101dhy\u0101ya (chapter 6) of the N\u0101\u1e6dya\u015b\u0101stra of Bharatamuni\u2014the celebrated work on Indian aesthetics\u2014together with the Abhinavabh\u0101rat\u012b commentary of Abhinavagupta. The discussion in the Abhinavabh\u0101rat\u012b includes a critical overview of the history of Indian aesthetics up to Abhinavagupta himself in the tenth century, including such thinkers as \u015ar\u012b \u015aa\u1e45kuka, Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da Lolla\u1e6da, Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da N\u0101yaka, etc. The aim of the workshop is not only to familiarize the participants with the principal questions and debates in Indian aesthetics, but also to discuss the philological challenges posed by these texts with experts in the field. We will therefore work with parallel texts and manuscripts in our readings of the Abhinavabh\u0101rat\u012b.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49650229, "asset_id": 28237591, "asset_type": "Work",

Abhinavagupta's works on aesthetics cover almost every aspect of the discipline. Above all, he created a coherent aesthetic system, which can be viewed as a continuation and an enhancement of the influential Rasa-bhava theory. The aim of this article is to provide a succinct description of Abhinavagupta's theory of aesthetics which encompasses his interpretation of the Rasa theory and his views on the nature of aesthetic and mystic experiences as closely related through s\u0301a\u0304ntarasa \u2013 a special kind of emotion described by Abhinava as a form of universal bliss of the Self (a\u0304tman).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33337919, "asset_id": 4714186, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6019714, "first_name": "Jaros\u0142aw", "last_name": "Zapart", "domain_name": "jagiellonian", "page_name": "JaroslawZapart", "display_name": "Jaros\u0142aw Zapart", "profile_url": "https://jagiellonian.academia.edu/JaroslawZapart?f_ri=763489", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6923, "name": "Sanskrit Poetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sanskrit_Poetics?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 49411, "name": "Indian Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Aesthetics?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 91963, "name": "Aesthetic Experience", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aesthetic_Experience?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 180247, "name": "Mystical experience", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mystical_experience?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 1143778, "name": "Abinavagupta", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Abinavagupta?f_ri=763489"}]}, {"id": 62689628, "title": "J\u0101m\u0101t\u1e5b Muni's Influence in \u1e6ch\u0101kura Bhaktivinoda and \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosw\u0101m\u012b (Part 6): The Case for Teleological Inherence", "created_at": "2021-11-29T02:37:59.722-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/62689628/J%C4%81m%C4%81t%E1%B9%9B_Munis_Influence_in_%E1%B9%ACh%C4%81kura_Bhaktivinoda_and_%C5%9Ar%C4%ABla_J%C4%ABva_Gosw%C4%81m%C4%AB_Part_6_The_Case_for_Teleological_Inherence?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_62689628", "summary": "Is bhakti inherent in the j\u012bva or not?

These strategies use different modes of identification and audience\u2013performer relationships. Autobiographical solo performance creates solidarity through shared identity or alliances between performer and audience. Abhinaya evokes pleasure and sensuality in multiple, ambiguous ways towards the goal of evoking rasa, ideally the audience\u2019s experience of emotional\u2013spiritual transcendence.

The multi-layered nature of a socio-religious ritual performance lends itself to two main conceptual frameworks. The first is the aesthetic criterion of order and place that is embedded in the collective memory of the audience. The second is the experience of shared aesthetics among community members who are immersed in the performance. The theory of Rasa in Indian traditions of thought affords itself to the explanation of such a cognitive movement during ritual performance that is coconstituted by socio-religious symbolism as well as an aesthetic display.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 237176, "first_name": "Meera", "last_name": "Baindur", "domain_name": "rvu", "page_name": "MeeraBaindur", "display_name": "Meera Baindur", "profile_url": "https://rvu.academia.edu/MeeraBaindur?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/237176/1390583/50181667/s65_meera.baindur.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2858, "name": "Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Culture?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4058, "name": "Ritual", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ritual?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16827, "name": "Asian Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Theatre?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 152388, "name": "Art Theory and Criticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_Theory_and_Criticism?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 236505, "name": "Tulu Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tulu_Language?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 337387, "name": "Aestehtics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aestehtics?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 373163, "name": "Ritual Practices", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ritual_Practices?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489"}]}, {"id": 68116312, "title": "Wretched and Blessed: Emotional Praise in a Sanskrit Hymn from Kashmir", "created_at": "2022-01-14T06:45:41.352-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/68116312/Wretched_and_Blessed_Emotional_Praise_in_a_Sanskrit_Hymn_from_Kashmir?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_68116312", "summary": "https://www.bloomsbury.com/ca/bloomsbury-research-handbook-of-emotions-in-classical-indian-philosophy-9781350167797/\n\nBook Description\n\nDrawing on a rich variety of premodern Indian texts across multiple traditions, genres, and languages, this collection explores how emotional experience is framed, evoked, and theorized in order to offer compelling insights into human subjectivity.\n\nRather than approaching emotion through the prism of Western theory, a team of leading scholars of Indian traditions showcases the literary texture, philosophical reflections, and theoretical paradigms that classical Indian sources provide in their own right. The focus is on how the texts themselves approach those dimensions of the human condition we may intuitively think of as being about emotion, without pre-judging what that might be. The result is a collection that reveals the range and diversity of phenomena that benefit from being gathered under the formal term \u201cemotion\u201d, but which in fact open up what such theorisation, representation, and expression might contribute to a cross-cultural understanding of this term. In doing so, these chapters contribute to a cosmopolitan, comparative, and pluralistic conception of human experience.\n\nAdopting a broad phenomenological methodology, this handbook reframes debates on emotion within classical Indian thought and is an invaluable resource for researchers and students seeking to understand the field beyond the Western tradition.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5193415, "first_name": "Hamsa", "last_name": "Stainton", "domain_name": "mcgill", "page_name": "HamsaStainton", "display_name": "Hamsa Stainton", "profile_url": "https://mcgill.academia.edu/HamsaStainton?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5193415/2683742/59559719/s65_hamsa.stainton.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5076, "name": "Sanskrit language and literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sanskrit_language_and_literature?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6921, "name": "Sanskrit", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sanskrit?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 55927, "name": "Kashmir", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kashmir?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 159405, "name": "Bhakti", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bhakti?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 274156, "name": "Bhakti Movement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bhakti_Movement?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489"}]}, {"id": 63316599, "title": "J\u0101m\u0101t\u1e5b Muni's Influence in \u1e6ch\u0101kura Bhaktivinoda and \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosw\u0101m\u012b (Part 7): Are \u015ar\u012b Bhaktivinoda and J\u012bva Gosw\u0101m\u012b Consistent in Stating that Bhakti Is Inherent?", "created_at": "2021-12-06T02:19:28.801-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/63316599/J%C4%81m%C4%81t%E1%B9%9B_Munis_Influence_in_%E1%B9%ACh%C4%81kura_Bhaktivinoda_and_%C5%9Ar%C4%ABla_J%C4%ABva_Gosw%C4%81m%C4%AB_Part_7_Are_%C5%9Ar%C4%AB_Bhaktivinoda_and_J%C4%ABva_Gosw%C4%81m%C4%AB_Consistent_in_Stating_that_Bhakti_Is_Inherent?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_63316599", "summary": "Is bhakti inherent in the j\u012bva or not?

CE), has influenced the idea of emotive suggestion (rasa dhvani) \u2013 one of the most prominent Indian aesthetic concepts, created by A\u0304nandavardhana (9th cent. CE). Firstly, the most important facets of Bhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s theory are presented, beginning with the essence of relation between spho\u1e6da \u2013 a singular and unchanging entity capable of conveying meaning \u2013 and its audible, differentiated, and temporal manifestation \u2013 dhvani. Next step lies in describing the theory of A\u0304nandavardhana, in which dhvani becomes a factor carrying the suggested meaning (vyan\u0303jana\u0304) of a single word and of a whole utterance; and eventually \u2013 a factor that can also convey the emotive suggestion of a literary work as a whole. It is proven that there exists a close relation between grasping the meaning of a statement through spho\u1e6da, and understanding the emotive overtone of a literary work through the power of suggestion (rasa dhvani).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36571642, "asset_id": 10640847, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6019714, "first_name": "Jaros\u0142aw", "last_name": "Zapart", "domain_name": "jagiellonian", "page_name": "JaroslawZapart", "display_name": "Jaros\u0142aw Zapart", "profile_url": "https://jagiellonian.academia.edu/JaroslawZapart?f_ri=763489", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 807, "name": "Philosophy Of Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_Of_Language?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 808, "name": "Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aesthetics?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5076, "name": "Sanskrit language and literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sanskrit_language_and_literature?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6504, "name": "Sphota", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sphota?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6922, "name": "Poetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poetics?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 6923, "name": "Sanskrit Poetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sanskrit_Poetics?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 49411, "name": "Indian Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Aesthetics?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 148229, "name": "Religion and Art, Sanskrit Studies, Sanskrit Aesthetics, Indian Philosophy, Indian Music, Dance and Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Art_Sanskrit_Studies_Sanskrit_Aesthetics_Indian_Philosophy_Indian_Music_Dance_and_?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 973510, "name": "Sanskrit Poetics (Particularly School of Dhvani", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sanskrit_Poetics_Particularly_School_of_Dhvani?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 973517, "name": "Anandavarddhan & Abhinavgupta)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anandavarddhan_and_Abhinavgupta_?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 980696, "name": "Dhvani and Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dhvani_and_Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489"}]}, {"id": 80343979, "title": "Bodily Engagements with Film, Image, and Technology: Somavision", "created_at": "2022-05-31T01:28:23.992-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/80343979/Bodily_Engagements_with_Film_Image_and_Technology_Somavision?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_80343979", "summary": "This book builds a new understanding of the body and its relationship to images and technology, using a framework where novel writings of pragmatist somaesthetics and phenomenology meet new research on bodily reactions.\n\nMax Ryyn\u00e4nen gives an overview of the topic by collecting the existing information of our bodies gazing at visual culture and the philosophies supporting these phenomena, and examines the way the gaze and the body come together in our relationship to culture. Themes covered include somatic film; the body in artistic documentation of activist art; body parts (and their mutilation or surgeries) in contemporary art and film; robot cars and our visual relationship to them; the usefulness of Indian rasa philosophy in explaining digital culture; and an examination of Mario Perniola\u2019s work about the idea that we, human beings, are increasingly experiencing ourselves to be simply \"things.\"\n\nThe book will be of interest to scholars working in art history, aesthetics, cultural philosophy, film studies, technology studies, media studies, cultural studies, and visual studies.\n\nTable of Contents\n1.

Kathakali performance, the speech of characters and the narrative are conveyed through multiple channels \u2013 verbal text is sung by onstage vocalists while the dancer interprets the story through hand gestures, body movements and facial expressions. Through engagement with the work of Gilles Deleuze and analysis of the play The Dumb Dancer by Asif Currimbhoy, the co-presence of vocal sense and nonsense on the Kathakali stage is investigated as a phenomenon by turns sensationalized and de-legitimized in a postcolonial context. Sneja Gunew\u2019s project of decolonizing affect theory, which raises the question of how to think meaningfully about affect beyond European concepts and terms, is taken up with regard to rasa theory, a key element of the performance aesthetics of Kathakali. Rather than viewing rasa as merely a prefiguration of Deleuzean (or post-Deleuzean) sensation or autonomic affect, a comparison between rasa and Deleuzean sense, defined as the evanescent boundary between propositions and things, is offered. Deleuzean sense presents an intriguing, albeit partial, analogue to rasa, a term that encompasses the process of tasting along with the essentially immanent nature of that which is tasted.\r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2421582, "first_name": "Seth", "last_name": "Powers", "domain_name": "gc-cuny", "page_name": "SethPowers", "display_name": "Seth Powers", "profile_url": "https://gc-cuny.academia.edu/SethPowers?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2421582/16756135/17024188/s65_seth.powers.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2337, "name": "Performance Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance_Studies?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8302, "name": "Gilles Deleuze", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gilles_Deleuze?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17330, "name": "Affect Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Theory?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21498, "name": "Affect/Emotion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Emotion?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 73401, "name": "INDIAN DRAMA & THEATRE", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/INDIAN_DRAMA_and_THEATRE?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 165437, "name": "Taste", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Taste?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 190116, "name": "Kathakali", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kathakali?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 359994, "name": "Aesthetics of Taste", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aesthetics_of_Taste?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 871738, "name": "Asif currimboy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asif_currimboy?f_ri=763489"}]}, {"id": 31380564, "title": "Review on Physico-Chemical Studies Done Related to the Mineral Formulations of Traditional Ayurvedic Rasaushadhie Preparations", "created_at": "2017-02-11T22:57:15.815-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31380564/Review_on_Physico_Chemical_Studies_Done_Related_to_the_Mineral_Formulations_of_Traditional_Ayurvedic_Rasaushadhie_Preparations?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_31380564", "summary": "\" Rasashastra \" is the branch of Ayurveda which deals with metals and minerals related pharmacology. The ayurvedic drugs affiliate with mineral, metallic preparations are called \" Rasaushadhies \". Due to innate qualities like quick action, lesser dose, tastelessness, prolonged shelf life, better palatability, the drugs derive from rasaushadhies i.e-\" bhasmas \" are becoming more popular. The traditional ayurvedic non-toxication process of these metals and minerals comprise of mainly 3 processes called Shodhana (bio purification), Jarana (roasting) and Marana (incineration/calcination), including Puta (heating) systems. During these processes toxic heavy metals and minerals subjected to changes in their particle size, structure and chemistry and further, toxicity decays. The minerals which are being used in these rasaushadhie preparations undergo many physical and chemical changes, during the preparation methods. Many researches have been conducted to study the changes happen in these mineral formulations. This paper reviews the general physico-chemical changes which occur during these rasaushadhie preparations. The studies were searched in the database of Directory of Open Access Journals, under the key words rasaushadhies, bhasma and physico-chemical studies. The studies which followed modern analytical procedures and techniques such as XRF, XRD, SEM, TGA, ICP-MS etc. were selected. In these studies, the transformations of minerals during the rasaushadhie preparations were clearly identified based on most common rasaushadhies like vanga, vaikrantha, yashada, naag, parada and sagandha bhasmas. The changes were identified in physico-chemical parameters like color, odor, weight change, particle size, chemical composition, crystal structure etc. The minerals undergo common physico-chemical changes while the preparations proceed, regardless of the type of mineral being used and the type of bhasma. Changes occur in between the procedures depend on the type of bhasma being prepared. Physical qualities of all the bhasmas are similar except in the color of Yashada bhasma. Identification of changes occurs in minerals and other constituents during these preparations is helpful in artificial synthesis of medicines of same functional capacity. And to use minerals in biological purposes by reducing their natural toxicity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51756462, "asset_id": 31380564, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24565291, "first_name": "Niroshan", "last_name": "Senavirathne", "domain_name": "uwu", "page_name": "NiroshanSenavirathne", "display_name": "Niroshan Senavirathne", "profile_url": "https://uwu.academia.edu/NiroshanSenavirathne?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24565291/6637812/10915091/s65_niroshan.senavirathne.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 140, "name": "Pharmacology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pharmacology?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 159, "name": "Microbiology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Microbiology?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 414, "name": "Mineralogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mineralogy?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 656, "name": "Pharmacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pharmacy?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2467, "name": "Conservation Biology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conservation_Biology?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 4072, "name": "Ayurvedic Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ayurvedic_Medicine?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 4553, "name": "Toxicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Toxicology?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 5077, "name": "Ayurveda (Sanskrit language and literature)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ayurveda_Sanskrit_language_and_literature_?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 9533, "name": "Minerals", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minerals?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 9862, "name": "Ayurveda", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ayurveda?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 14366, "name": "Mineral Processing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mineral_Processing?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 64405, "name": "Ayurveda, traditional medicine, ethnobotany", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ayurveda_traditional_medicine_ethnobotany?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 146671, "name": "Mineral Resources", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mineral_Resources?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 251531, "name": "Mineralogy Geology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mineralogy_Geology?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 347959, "name": "Mineral Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mineral_Nutrition?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 987807, "name": "Ayurvedic Pharmaceutics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ayurvedic_Pharmaceutics?f_ri=763489"}, {"id": 1008764, "name": "Rasa\u015b\u0101stra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasasastra?f_ri=763489"}]}, {"id": 16413058, "title": "Altering the Lenses: Reading Macbeth through Rasa Theory", "created_at": "2015-10-02T13:52:40.700-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/16413058/Altering_the_Lenses_Reading_Macbeth_through_Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489", "dom_id": "work_16413058", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11700505, "first_name": "Tanzia", "last_name": "Mobarak", "domain_name": "juniv", "page_name": "tanzia_monisha", "display_name": "Tanzia Mobarak", "profile_url": "https://juniv.academia.edu/tanzia_monisha?f_ri=763489", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11700505/4039181/32543405/s65_tanzia_mobarak.monisha.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3146, "name": "Shakespeare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shakespeare?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 57382, "name": "Macbeth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Macbeth?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 341904, "name": "Indian Poetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Poetics?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 763489, "name": "Rasa Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasa_Theory?f_ri=763489", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 13998542, "title": "\u201cParticipation without a Code.\u201d Play, Perform, Participate \u2013 Intermedial Intersections.

Both discuss the social significance of drama, the importance of plot and the insistence on its strict mechanics. Also, both texts approach the presence of unsavoury content \u2013 yet within the machinery of a codified framework that puts on display a participatory model of a \u2018redeeming\u2019 quality. In the case of the former, the cathartic quality of tragedy is distilled out of suffering (pathos) and put forward; the latter argues for the uplifting pleasure (ananda) of experiencing an aesthetic emotion (rasa). Both Aristotle and Bharata Muni see the drama as a narrative of becoming that is strictly purposive in character. Further still, both employ a calculated concoction of formal elements and, in the case of the Sanskrit drama, suggestive material (costume, gait), to instruct audiences about the nature of action and to glean insights about the causal network of probability and necessity. Because of their interactionist and actional focus, both the principles of anukara\u1e47a in the Sanskrit drama and mimesis in Greek tragedy tightly intertwine with drama\u2019s capacity to impart sentiment, an element non-representational and supra-narrational.*** In this sense, the inclusion of b\u012bbhatsa in N\u0101\u1e6dya\u015b\u0101stra, the odious sentiment or the aesthetic emotion imparting disgust and aversion, has a democratic edge to it. It is fully incorporated into the general theory of rasa and, although Bharata dedicates only two small passages to the aesthetic emotion of aversion, it is put on equal footing with the remaining seven types of sentiment. B\u012bbhatsa arises out of the same codified framework as the remaining rasa and is associated with a certain prescribed amalgamation of emotive elements such as gesture, gait and mimic set to impart a purely affective state. Once its recognisability is asserted in this way, b\u012bbhatsa becomes a fully fledged constituent of the theory of aesthetic emotion. It thus becomes equally capable of providing access to ananda, the impassive, non-purposive aesthetic pleasure that Abhinavagupta declared to be the aim of drama in Abhinavabharati. A similar purposiveness is observed in the treatment of the Greek pathos. Once the inclusion of unsavoury content loses its direct link to this network of aesthetic conventions, however, its status as a constituent of drama becomes contentious. Where plot and action gain new dimensions, this aesthetic mode no longer has a strictly ordained place. After a short theoretical exposition, I look at Sarah Kane\u2019s play Blasted and examples from the history of British censorship to show how the reception of the phenomenon of in-yer-face theatre becomes a telling example in this respect.
