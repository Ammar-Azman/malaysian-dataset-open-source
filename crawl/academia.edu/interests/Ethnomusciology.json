As West Africa\u2019s pioneer popular music and as a social construct, highlife is a socio-musical phenomenon with diverse interpretations and appropriations. Drawing on three decades of academic and professional engagements in Ghana and Nigeria, as well as the literature on gospel music by notable scholars, this article asks: What exactly is gospel highlife? How does the concept of gospel highlife fit into or challenge the idea of social stratification which characterised highlife at its inception? How does the concept of gospel highlife speak to issues of social identity and economic determinism in a postmodern and neoliberal age? Overall, this article interrogates the epistemological basis of the term \u2018gospel highlife\u2019 compared to what may be described, for want of a better term, as \u2018secular highlife\u2019, as well as narratives of its historical development. This article argues that the concept of gospel highlife goes beyond the mere idea of \u2018highlife without alcohol\u2019. Rather, the concept is nested in an interest-bound epistemological premise that reflects social, economic and gendered imperatives. We conclude that both gospel and secular highlife, just like the music minister- musician constructed binary, is a paradox of sameness and difference.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68786813, "asset_id": 50913259, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 47351579, "first_name": "Grace", "last_name": "Takyi", "domain_name": "ugh", "page_name": "GTakyi", "display_name": "Grace Takyi", "profile_url": "https://ugh.academia.edu/GTakyi?f_ri=355472", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/47351579/13348361/14587253/s65_grace.takyi.jpg"}, {"id": 5340461, "first_name": "Austin", "last_name": "Emielu", "domain_name": "ugh", "page_name": "ughacademiaeduAustinEmielu", "display_name": "Austin Emielu", "profile_url": "https://ugh.academia.edu/ughacademiaeduAustinEmielu?f_ri=355472", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5340461/2359942/49863709/s65_austin.emielu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=355472", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 379, "name": "African Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Studies?f_ri=355472", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6778, "name": "African Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Music?f_ri=355472", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7520, "name": "Popular Culture and Religious Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Culture_and_Religious_Studies?f_ri=355472", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28061, "name": "World music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_music?f_ri=355472"}, {"id": 38123, "name": "West African Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/West_African_Music?f_ri=355472"}, {"id": 101917, "name": "Popular Music and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Music_and_Culture?f_ri=355472"}, {"id": 355472, "name": "Ethnomusciology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnomusciology?f_ri=355472"}, {"id": 3868025, "name": "Ghanaian Comtemporary Music Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ghanaian_Comtemporary_Music_Studies?f_ri=355472"}]}, {"id": 48959039, "title": "\u201cO\u0323m\u00f2\u0323j\u00f3\u0323l\u00e1, Bod\u00e9. \u2014 Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 Music in the Twentieth Century: Identity, Agency and Performance Practice.

The repertoire of this music tradition, however, is composed of dance music. In Boston, there is a group of Irish dancers who attend music sessions, seeking out live music performance with which they can dance. In these live performances, musicians and dancers have the opportunity to create collaborative and mutually meaningful performances. In my research, I explore the nature of collaborative performance between musicians and dancers in Boston Irish music sessions through an investigation of social relationships, participatory expectations, and performance elements like tempo, instrumentation, rhythm and dance style. Dancers are performing an improvisatory genre of Irish dance known as sean-n\u00f3s as a method of achieving successful collaborative performances with live musicians. The success of a music session is measured by the musicians\u2019 likelihood and ability to experience groove. A successful collaboration between music and dancers is measured against this same experiential goal. In some circumstances, the experience of groove leads to the experience of flow.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63670307, "asset_id": 43377056, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 112449120, "first_name": "Samantha", "last_name": "Jones", "domain_name": "harvard", "page_name": "SamanthaJones", "display_name": "Samantha Jones", "profile_url": "https://harvard.academia.edu/SamanthaJones?f_ri=355472", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/112449120/30250197/34195271/s65_samantha.jones.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 78155, "name": "Traditional Irish Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Traditional_Irish_Music?f_ri=355472", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 190910, "name": "Groove", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Groove?f_ri=355472", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 355472, "name": "Ethnomusciology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnomusciology?f_ri=355472", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 419205, "name": "Irish Traditional Dance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish_Traditional_Dance?f_ri=355472", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1363659, "name": "Irish Step Dance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish_Step_Dance?f_ri=355472"}]}, {"id": 41648894, "title": "The Analysis of Musical Performance by the Lead Violin Player in Traditional String Bands in Slovakia: Preliminary Thoughts", "created_at": "2020-01-16T01:33:42.114-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41648894/The_Analysis_of_Musical_Performance_by_the_Lead_Violin_Player_in_Traditional_String_Bands_in_Slovakia_Preliminary_Thoughts?f_ri=355472", "dom_id": "work_41648894", "summary": "Traditional Music and Dance in Contemporary Culture(s).

Nevertheless, Hindu philosophy does promote string instruments through pictures and statues of gods and goddesses. It is interesting to look at how musical instruments were categorized in Hindu and Buddhist cultures of India and Sri Lanka throughout the history until today as the guiding role of educated clergymen decreased and the globalized Internet offers other musical instruments being used or modified for many previously unknown purposes. This research aims at a historical analysis of musical instruments used in Sri Lanka seen through different perspectives such as political, religious, or mythological views. The way how they are currently presented in mostly non-institutional internet sources is included. The value system that promotes string instruments as a sign of musical development forms the background of reflections in Internet applications dealing with musical instruments. One example is the promotion of the ravanhatta, a bowed spike fiddle, which is inaccurately presented as the \u201cfirst violin\u201d of the world. Through interviews with music teachers and people who provide Internet services, the phenomenon of this multi-layered problem can be clearly addressed. In result, an alternative view on musical instruments used in Sri Lankan culture will be provided. \nKeywords: Knowledge cultures. Online resources. Musical instruments. Sri Lanka.

Created and developed by Ana Mar\u00eda Alarc\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez, Heather Strohschein, and Liza Munk, this project interviews students from various European universities. The students were asked to share their thoughts on their views of ethnomusicology and how those views are fostered by their home institutions; what major theories or issues they are tackling in their research; and whether the regional economic crisis impacts their lives as students, their research, and/or their future academic aspirations.\r\n\r\nThe students responded to a questionnaire with answers in both English and either their native language or their academic language (not every student we interview is going to school in their home country). Both languages will be posted as part of this project. In Discipline will try to offer a broad picture which includes countries both within and beyond the borders of the current European Union.\r\n\r\nRetreived from https://semstudentunion.wordpress.com/series/in-discipline-talks-from-the-european-side/, 13 September 2015.
