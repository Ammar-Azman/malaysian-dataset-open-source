I  present  a  mixture  of  ethnographic,  historical,  and  textual  data  related  to  a  Sufi \nmovement  that  has  been  embedded\nin  Dusun  Nyoir  of  Narathiwat  Province  since  the  1940s.  Most  even  vaguely \nfamiliar  with  the  geography  of  violence  in  South  Thailand  will  be  aware  that  this  was  the  site  of  one  of  the  most \ndeadly  notorious  altercations  between  Malay  villagers  and  Thai  secur\nity  forces  in  the  twentieth  century.  Indeed, \nsuggestions have even been made that the timing of the April 2004 attacks were connected with the events of April \n1948. Although this paper builds on previous studies, its primary objective is to both place the \nDusun Nyoir rebellion \nin  its  wider  geo\n-\npolitical  context,  and  to  revisit  conceived  wisdom  about  the  role  of  Islamic  movements  (albeit \ninadequately)  classified  as  Sufism.  In  Narathiwat  and  Kelantan  following  contacts  with \nHaji  Muhammad  Salleh  bin \nAbdul  Kari\nm  (1916\n-\n1959)  of  Batu Pahat  (Johor Baru) \n\u2013\nbetter  known  as  Kyai \nSalleh \n\u2013\na movement  locally known  as \nAyat Pa\u2019\n(\nempat\n)  spread  his  repertoire  of \namalan\n, \nhiqmah, \nand  esoteric  knowledge,  such  as  invulnerability  (\nilum \nkebal\n). I describe how the Sultan of Johor \nBaru, and his Mutfi, a certain Haji Fadil, co\n-\nopted Kyai Salleh by inducted \nhim  (perhaps  temporarily)  into  the  Qadriyyah  wa  Naqshabandiyya \ntariqa\n,  before  commissioning  him  to  defend \nMalay communities against  the anarchy  that  was rapidly  spreading throughou\nt Malaya. As is well known, following \nthe  Japanese  surrender,  communist  forces  attempted  to  consolidate  their  position  before  the  return  of  the  British \nrule. I show that similar situations existed in north of the Golok River.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39009300, "asset_id": 16475372, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 667449, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Joll", "domain_name": "victoria", "page_name": "ChristopherJoll", "display_name": "Christopher M Joll", "profile_url": "https://victoria.academia.edu/ChristopherJoll?f_ri=1275844", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/667449/851788/1060921/s65_cm.joll.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=1275844", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=1275844", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=1275844", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15473, "name": "Muslims in Southern Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslims_in_Southern_Thailand?f_ri=1275844", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17240, "name": "Contemporary Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Sufism?f_ri=1275844"}, {"id": 28459, "name": "Tariqa Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tariqa_Sufism?f_ri=1275844"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=1275844"}, {"id": 102363, "name": "Malay Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Studies?f_ri=1275844"}, {"id": 123450, "name": "Southern Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southern_Thailand?f_ri=1275844"}, {"id": 719838, "name": "Conflict In Southern Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_In_Southern_Thailand?f_ri=1275844"}, {"id": 910719, "name": "Violence in South Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Violence_in_South_Thailand?f_ri=1275844"}, {"id": 991397, "name": "Deep South of Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deep_South_of_Thailand?f_ri=1275844"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=1275844"}, {"id": 1115294, "name": "Malay Muslims of Southernmost Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Muslims_of_Southernmost_Thailand?f_ri=1275844"}, {"id": 1275844, "name": "Qadriyyah", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qadriyyah?f_ri=1275844"}, {"id": 1923964, "name": "Narathiwat", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narathiwat?f_ri=1275844"}]}, {"id": 5960282, "title": "(2014) Thailand's Sufi Networks: New Perspectives on Islamic Diversity and Muslim Marginality.
