(2020). From the pulpit to the streets: the organizational rhetoric of the UCCP on justice, peace, and human rights during the Duterte Presidency, Unpublished Master\u2019s Thesis, University of the Philippines-Diliman. \n\nThis study shows that identification strategies are used by the United Church of Christ in the Philippines in justifying its participation in justice, peace, and human rights ministry. Through common ground strategies reflected in the church\u2019s organizational documents, the UCCP communicates common values and principles not only with its members but with secular progressive groups as well. The UCCP rhetors also use the principles of a transcendent \u201cwe\u201d in framing church history and its lived experience of Martial Law as a binding factor with members. Scriptural terministic screens such as the use of: human rights are God\u2019s gifts that must be safeguarded, Christ sides with the poor and oppressed, opposing unjust powers is prophetic witnessing, and justice-based peace is the establishment of God\u2019s kingdom on earth are used as bridging devices to transform secular political acts into God-ordained divine activities. Additionally, the church also frames new religious movement (NRM) churches as its antithesis, representing the opposite of the UCCP\u2019s substance. These churches are framed as newcomers that are diluting the essence of Christian prophetic witness. \n\nRhetorical strategies of guilt-redemption are employed by the UCCP during the Duterte presidency. The church communicates justice-based peace as the symbolic order it pursues, and the violence of state forces are the causes of guilt in the order. During the start of President Duterte\u2019s term, he was portrayed by the church as an \u201cindividual\u201d performing mortification to rid the nation of the guilt of past administrations. However, in 2018, the church began to frame President Duterte as the \u201cState\u201d, the scapegoat that must be punished for his own sins. This victimage of President Duterte is justified by the church by framing their opposition towards him as mortification through prophetic witnessing which will redeem the nation from sins of violence and injustice. The church communicates identification with secular progressive groups for they are framed in the statements as performing the same mortification as the church, showing a strong relationship between the church and these external audiences. \n\nFindings of this study also show that members who identify as progressives and those who are fluent in citing organizational identity claims show closer social distance with church rhetors vis-a-vis the church\u2019s JPHR stand during President Duterte\u2019s administration. In short, the rhetorical strategies of the UCCP reinforce the political stand of members who already identify as progressives in the first place. However, Duterte\u2019s populist rhetoric, the competing rhetoric of other churches, and the challenge to maintain organizational democracy within the UCCP hinder other members of the organization to agree with their bishops\u2019 stand. Overall, the rhetoric of the UCCP allows the church to create a closer social distance with secular progressive groups, giving divine legitimacy to justice, peace, and human rights activism. \n\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68791932, "asset_id": 50917129, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4509669, "first_name": "Junesse", "last_name": "Crisostomo", "domain_name": "up-diliman", "page_name": "JCrisostomo", "display_name": "Junesse Crisostomo", "profile_url": "https://up-diliman.academia.edu/JCrisostomo?f_ri=1206518", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4509669/50718158/50723354/s65_junesse.crisostomo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=1206518", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5792, "name": "Social Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Justice?f_ri=1206518", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45559, "name": "Peace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace?f_ri=1206518", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 111212, "name": "Organizational Rhetoric", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organizational_Rhetoric?f_ri=1206518", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 129005, "name": "Progressive Christianity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Progressive_Christianity?f_ri=1206518"}, {"id": 295495, "name": "Political and Religious Rhetoric", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_and_Religious_Rhetoric?f_ri=1206518"}, {"id": 1206518, "name": "Peace Talks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_Talks?f_ri=1206518"}, {"id": 2526906, "name": "President Rodrigo Roa Duterte", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/President_Rodrigo_Roa_Duterte?f_ri=1206518"}]}, {"id": 43975275, "title": "The beginnings of conflict transformation in south Thailand", "created_at": "2020-08-29T06:02:17.880-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43975275/The_beginnings_of_conflict_transformation_in_south_Thailand?f_ri=1206518", "dom_id": "work_43975275", "summary": "2020 was the year that saw the beginnings of conflict transformation in southern Thailand and the beginning of a process that should eventually lead to some form of resolution to a separatist conflict that has claimed more than 7,000 lives since 2004. 2020 began with the 'Geneva Call Declaration', which was followed by two meetings between insurgent representatives and the Thai military, in both January and March. Most importantly, 2020 saw the lengthiest cessation of hostilities that has taken place between the two sides since 2004: the covid19 ceasefire. This article assesses the importance of these developments and puts forward the argument that 2020 has been the most significant year for conflict resolution efforts in the south since the conflict began in 2004; although there are many factors in place that may obstruct efforts at securing a lasting resolution to this conflict in the near future. Additionally, this essay provides background to the arguments put forward by examining processes and events since 2014 that have paved the way for the aforementioned developments of 2020.",

This article examines the dialogue process and probes the factors that led to the collapse of the process, as well as proposals for future successful talks and how to decide the future relations between the two sides.

In the previous annual report, Negotiating a Peaceful Coexistence between the Malays of Patani and the Thai State, the Patani Forum looked at the various attempts to generate peace talks between the Thai government and various separatist movements from 2005 to 2012. We explained why none of these initiatives, which were secretive in nature, succeeded in generating meaningful traction. Two months after this report was released, the Thai government made the February 28 announcement. While the process has faltered, as will be outlined below, the significance of Bangkok acknowledging the political nature of the separatist movement cannot be overstated. In this annual Special Report, the Patani Forum examines the significance and impact of the February 28, 2013 announcement. In the Introduction, we provide a brief overview of previous talks between separatists and Thai authorities and discuss what makes the February 28 announcement different from previous iterations of talks. In Section I, we look at insurgency activity leading up to the announcement and explore why, a year later, the peace process has come to a virtual standstill. We begin this examination with the so-called Mayo Operation of July 2012, which was caught on CCTV, and end with the Bacho Operation in February 2013, the same month the official peace talks were announced. In Section II, we focus on the peace process itself, discussing key meetings and exploring their connection to insurgent activity on the ground. We also discuss the", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57261167, "asset_id": 37305350, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 374003, "first_name": "Ekkarin", "last_name": "Tuansiri", "domain_name": "psu", "page_name": "EkkarinTuansiri", "display_name": "Ekkarin  Tuansiri", "profile_url": "https://psu.academia.edu/EkkarinTuansiri?f_ri=1206518", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/374003/97294/15001808/s65_ekkarin.tuansiri.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1206518, "name": "Peace Talks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_Talks?f_ri=1206518", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 31045218, "title": "\"...IF YOU WILL OBEY HIM (MUHAMMAD PBUH), YOU WILL BE GUIDED...\" (AL-QURAN, 24:54 by imam murthda gusau", "created_at": "2017-01-23T03:22:19.052-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31045218/_IF_YOU_WILL_OBEY_HIM_MUHAMMAD_PBUH_YOU_WILL_BE_GUIDED_AL_QURAN_24_54_by_imam_murthda_gusau?f_ri=1206518", "dom_id": "work_31045218", "summary": "Verily, all praise is for Allah, we seek His help and His forgiveness.

Certain local and external factors also shape the conflict, such as the role of Malaysia as a safe-haven for insurgents and the role of the black-economy in the region.

Peace between them will stop the dangers of outbreak of armed/nuclear conflict. The time has come for Pakistan and India to make a critical choice between war and peace, love and hate, destruction and development, poverty and prosperity. This would only be possible through the process of negotiations based on the year to year discussions on different issues. Lahore summit was a success for both countries as India and Pakistan had showed their peaceful intentions for each other. Agra summit had created good will after the Kargil war which had frozen their relations. Peace talks of 2004 had showed that there was no sign of consensus in India on holding unconditional negotiations with Pakistan. There were different domestic constraints which acted as a hurdle for Pakistan foreign policy towards India. As foreign policy is the reflection of a country\u2019s internal strengths and weaknesses, the control of domestic constraints of Pakistan would also create an impact on its relations with India.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33609298, "asset_id": 6937373, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11711173, "first_name": "Scholar", "last_name": "Pakistan", "domain_name": "pu-pk1", "page_name": "ScholarPakistan", "display_name": "Scholar Pakistan", "profile_url": "https://pu-pk1.academia.edu/ScholarPakistan?f_ri=1206518", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11711173/3376827/3973542/s65_scholar.pakistan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7361, "name": "Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan?f_ri=1206518", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48150, "name": "Pakistan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan_Studies?f_ri=1206518", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 64297, "name": "US-Pakistan Relations, US-India-Pakistan Relations, Pakistan occupied Kashmir(PoK)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/US-Pakistan_Relations_US-India-Pakistan_Relations_Pakistan_occupied_Kashmir_PoK_?f_ri=1206518", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102019, "name": "Political and security situation in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Middle East", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_and_security_situation_in_Afghanistan_Pakistan_India_and_Middle_East?f_ri=1206518", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 162294, "name": "Politics and Terrorism in South Asia, Indian and Pakistani Foreign Policy, Drug Trafficking in South Asia, US role in South Asia, War on Terrorism etc.", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_and_Terrorism_in_South_Asia_Indian_and_Pakistani_Foreign_Policy_Drug_Trafficking_in_South?f_ri=1206518"}, {"id": 508355, "name": "Pakistan's Foreign Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistans_Foreign_Policy?f_ri=1206518"}, {"id": 1206518, "name": "Peace Talks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_Talks?f_ri=1206518"}, {"id": 1377693, "name": "Lahore Declaration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lahore_Declaration?f_ri=1206518"}]}, {"id": 8017888, "title": "The 2013 Kuala Lumpur Talks: A step forward for southern Thailand", "created_at": "2014-08-18T21:55:15.184-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8017888/The_2013_Kuala_Lumpur_Talks_A_step_forward_for_southern_Thailand?f_ri=1206518", "dom_id": "work_8017888", "summary": "In 2013, talks were held in Kuala Lumpur between Thailand\u2019s National Security Council (NSC) and representatives of the Malay-Muslim separatist group Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN).

This article critically examines the turbulent ten month period from the February 28th declaration in Kuala Lumpur to the December 29th announcement by General Prayuth Chan-ocha that the military, and not the NSC, would represent Thailand at the next round of talks. This article also evaluates the positive aspects of the talks and the current barriers toward further progress for peace in the region. Additionally, attention is also drawn to the relevance of BRN\u2019s communication with both the general public and the NSC.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65137826, "asset_id": 8017888,

"summary": "My respected people, many times young Muslims decide they want to become scholars and embark on the path of knowledge with little knowledge of what to expect. I was such a youngster who signed up for an \" 'alim \" course with no idea what an 'alim is or where it would lead me. In order to help my fellow Muslims prepare themselves psychologically and not repeat the mistakes I made, I present to you ten things I feel every student of knowledge must know (in no particular order): 1. A few years of study does not make one a scholar: Too often, young Muslims study a few books or for a few years and then develop a \" scholar \" complex. They begin to force their opinions on others as if they can't be wrong. They become intolerant to other views, and they write anybody off who disagrees with them as deviant. We need to realize, before we even begin our journey of knowledge, that the sciences of Islam are many and deep; the variety of opinions in fiqh are multiple, and the chances of always being right are slim. I advise all of my fellow young Muslims to tread carefully, keep egos in check, approach differences with the possibility of being wrong, and never forget to say \" Allah knows Best. \" 2. Manners come first: In the past, most scholars would train their students in good manners before teaching them Islamic knowledge. Parents, too, would encourage their children to learn manners before the Islamic sciences. Sadly, today many institutes do not teach good manners to their students, expecting them to automatically gain them through their study", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49354695, "asset_id": 28920385, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 39849481, "first_name": "Ibrahim", "last_name": "muhammad", "domain_name": "unimaid", "page_name": "Imuhammad", "display_name": "Ibrahim muhammad", "profile_url": "https://unimaid.academia.edu/Imuhammad?f_ri=1206518", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/39849481/13837074/14924504/s65_ibrahim.muhammad.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1206518, "name": "Peace Talks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_Talks?f_ri=1206518", "nofollow": false}]}]
