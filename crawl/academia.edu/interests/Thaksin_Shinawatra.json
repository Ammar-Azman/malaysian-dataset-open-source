The expansion of civil society is seen to expand political space. This paper takes a critical lens to this perspective, using recent political events in Thailand as a case study of the political strategies and alliances of social movements. We examine the debates that saw many social movements and their leaderships initially support elected Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his Thai Rak Thai Party only to see this support drain away as these same movements called on their followers to bring down the government. More importantly, we examine how these movements came to ally with conservative forces associated with the palace and military. Based on the Thai case study, we suggest that these seemingly unlikely outcomes result from the very nature of social movements. Leadership by middle-class activists, the need for alliances, the development of networks, and a focus on single issues and identities leads social movements to make substantial political compromises. The consequences can be negative for democratic development.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34772526, "asset_id": 8123175, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3274774, "first_name": "Kevin", "last_name": "Hewison", "domain_name": "unc", "page_name": "KevinHewison", "display_name": "Kevin Hewison", "profile_url": "https://unc.academia.edu/KevinHewison?f_ri=344544", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3274774/1085084/1353289/s65_kevin.hewison.jpg"}, {"id": 42313557, "first_name": "Kengkij", "last_name": "Kitirianglarp", "domain_name": "chiangmai", "page_name": "KengkijKitirianglarp", "display_name": "Kengkij  Kitirianglarp", "profile_url": "https://chiangmai.academia.edu/KengkijKitirianglarp?f_ri=344544", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/42313557/11411564/12728656/s65_kengkij.kitirianglarp.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 208, "name": "Social Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Movements?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 344544, "name": "Thaksin Shinawatra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thaksin_Shinawatra?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 38108163, "title": "From Illiberal Democracy to Military Authoritar- ianism: Intra-Elite Struggle and Mass-Based Conflict in Deeply Polarized Thailand", "created_at": "2019-01-07T23:28:39.675-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38108163/From_Illiberal_Democracy_to_Military_Authoritar_ianism_Intra_Elite_Struggle_and_Mass_Based_Conflict_in_Deeply_Polarized_Thailand?f_ri=344544", "dom_id": "work_38108163", "summary": "Thailand fits the pattern of pernicious polarized politics identified in this volume, where a previously excluded group successfully gains political power through the ballot box, governs unilaterally to pursue radical reforms, and produces a backlash from the traditional power elites.

But it was not the last coup Thailand had experienced. In May 2014, the military staged another coup overthrowing the elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra (2011-2014). Yingluck is sister of Thaksin. Months before, anti-government protesters took control of business districts in Bangkok while putting pressure on Yingluck who was attempting to pass an Amnesty Bill that could set her brother free from corruption charges. The protests paved the way for the military to once again intervene in politics and suggested that the army\u2019s political interests seemed to align with those of the protesters. Currently, Thailand is under the custody of the military regime of Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha, former army chief and leader of the coup makers. The enduring political crisis has effectively shaped the contour of the country\u2019s foreign policy, especially in its relations with the great powers. The crisis has also provided a vital platform for these powers\u2014in this case, the United States and China, to compete with each other in order to influence the behaviour and policy of Thailand at a time when the country has been experiencing political turbulence. It is however imperative to explain in a wider context the role of Washington and Beijing in Thailand\u2019s protracted crisis and their competition for power and supremacy in Southeast Asia. Thailand continues to serve as a \u201cstrategic depot\u201d for the two great powers to consolidate their sphere of influence in this part of the world. From this perspective, it can be argued that the Thai political situation has further intensified the level of competition between the United States and China, which has in turn readjusted the overall balance of power in Southeast Asia. This paper examines the different approaches of the United States and China in dealing with the Thai crisis. It asks: Which approach is more effective in the attempt to win the Thai influence? It investigates the way in which the competition between the two great powers has come to dominate Thailand\u2019s foreign affairs. In the final section, the paper briefly discusses the standing of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Thailand\u2019s polarised politics and seeks to elucidate whether Thailand has been able to exploit its position in ASEAN to dilute the overwhelming power of the United States and China over its domestic and foreign affairs.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38846365, "asset_id": 16001745, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 840326, "first_name": "Southeast Asia Research Centre", "last_name": "CityU", "domain_name": "cityu-hk", "page_name": "searc", "display_name": "Southeast Asia Research Centre CityU", "profile_url": "https://cityu-hk.academia.edu/searc?f_ri=344544", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/840326/295979/350173/s65_southeast_asia.cityu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38972, "name": "ASEAN", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 96933, "name": "Politics in Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_in_Thailand?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 344544, "name": "Thaksin Shinawatra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thaksin_Shinawatra?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 344549, "name": "Yingluck Shinawatra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yingluck_Shinawatra?f_ri=344544"}]}, {"id": 4137884, "title": "Why did Thailand's middle class turn against a democratically elected government?

Survey research shows that opponents of Thaksin had a stronger commitment to liberal democracy and possibly to royalist values while rural voters supported Thaksin because he fulfilled their social demands. Opposition to Thaksin was not motivated by economic interests, but rather, there is some evidence that urban middle- and upper-class voters disliked Thaksin because they heard negative reporting about him, which were less available in the countryside. These findings are compatible with a new theory of democratic consolidation, in which the upper classes have the means that would enable and encourage them to pay sufficient attention to politics to discover that what they viewed as \u201cgood government\u201d was violated by the ruling party, which could have led to demands for more democracy historically. More recently, however, in Thailand and perhaps other instances in Southeast Asia and Latin America, those with the money and leisure to follow politics closely have heard reports about the \u201cbad government\u201d of populist, democratically elected leaders, and thus have turned against them.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37956009, "asset_id": 4137884, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4995763, "first_name": "Kai", "last_name": "J\u00e4ger", "domain_name": "kcl", "page_name": "KaiJ\u00e4ger", "display_name": "Kai  J\u00e4ger", "profile_url": "https://kcl.academia.edu/KaiJ%C3%A4ger?f_ri=344544", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4995763/2166329/10802485/s65_kai.j_ger.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 208, "name": "Social Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Movements?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 928, "name": "Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Studies?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4375, "name": "Social Movement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Movement?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5091, "name": "Democratization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democratization?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=344544"}, {"id": 12470, "name": "Public Opinion (Political Science)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Opinion_Political_Science_?f_ri=344544"}, {"id": 13860, "name": "Sociology of the Middle Classes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_the_Middle_Classes?f_ri=344544"}, {"id": 22075, "name": "Democratisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democratisation?f_ri=344544"}, {"id": 153660, "name": "Political Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Knowledge?f_ri=344544"}, {"id": 201280, "name": "Democratic consolidation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democratic_consolidation?f_ri=344544"}, {"id": 344544, "name": "Thaksin Shinawatra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thaksin_Shinawatra?f_ri=344544"}, {"id": 1490609, "name": "Military coup Thailand 2006", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_coup_Thailand_2006?f_ri=344544"}]}, {"id": 31056815, "title": "PARTY ORGANIZATION UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THAKSIN SHINAWATRA: A STUDY OF THE THAI RAK THAI,PEOPLE'S POWER AND PHEU THAI PARTIES By Somchai Saenphumi", "created_at": "2017-01-24T00:06:25.664-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31056815/PARTY_ORGANIZATION_UNDER_THE_LEADERSHIP_OF_THAKSIN_SHINAWATRA_A_STUDY_OF_THE_THAI_RAK_THAI_PEOPLES_POWER_AND_PHEU_THAI_PARTIES_By_Somchai_Saenphumi?f_ri=344544", "dom_id": "work_31056815", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51490854, "asset_id": 31056815, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 48550240, "first_name": "Somchai", "last_name": "Saenphumi (\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e0a\u0e31\u0e22 \u0e41\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e20\u0e39\u0e21\u0e35)", "domain_name": "vru-th", "page_name": "SomchaiSaenphumi", "display_name": "Somchai Saenphumi (\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e0a\u0e31\u0e22 \u0e41\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e20\u0e39\u0e21\u0e35)", "profile_url": "https://vru-th.academia.edu/SomchaiSaenphumi?f_ri=344544", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/48550240/13135114/56807213/s65_somchai.saenphumi_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 29563, "name": "Candidate Selection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Candidate_Selection?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30311, "name": "Party organization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Party_organization?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 86536, "name": "Intra-party democracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intra-party_democracy?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 344544, "name": "Thaksin Shinawatra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thaksin_Shinawatra?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 951122, "name": "Political Parties and Party Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Parties_and_Party_Politics?f_ri=344544"}, {"id": 2173512, "name": "Amnesty Laws", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amnesty_Laws?f_ri=344544"}]}, {"id": 20268454, "title": "Who Governs?

This theoretical discussion is grounded empirically in a description of one such network whose power is\nderived from sources other than electoral legitimacy or long-standing historical tradition. The article discusses the enormous influence this network has exercised in reshaping Thailand\u2019s political order, all while remaining largely invisible to the public eye.

"ABSTRAK Sosok Raja yang telah menjadi sosok yang dipatuhi dan dihormati oleh masyarakat Thailand sedikit banyak turut memberikan pengaruh di dalam seluruh aspek kehidupan masyarakat Thailand. Raja yang memiliki legitimasi sangat kuat dari seluruh lapisan masyarakat menjadikan Raja dapat dengan mudah turut mengintervensi atau berperan lebih di dalam perpolitikan Thailand. Namun di sisi lain Raja juga harus terus mempertahankan eksistensi dan keberadaan dirinya di tengah semakin berkembangnya masyarakat Thailand. Dan dalam hal ini, Raja menjalin hubungan kedekatan yang khusus dengan militer Thailand. Militer Thailand yang berperan sebagai guardian of the state dan dipandang sebagai institusi yang mampu dan wajib menjamin keamanan negara selanjutnya turut berperan dalam mengamankan negara dari segala hal yang merupakan penentangan atau pegacuhan terhadap Raja. Militer Thailand yang pada praktiknya terlibat di dalam perpolitikan Thailand pun menjadikan kedekatannya dengan Raja menjadi mempermudah upaya militer dalam mencapai kepentingan politiknya. Dan hubungan saling membutuhkan antara Raja dan militer Thailand ini lah yang selanjutnya mempengaruhi kudeta yang terjadi pada tahun 2006.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53025929, "asset_id":

investigation of Thaksin Shinawatra\u2019s Perceptions is necessarily important to the understanding of Thailand\u2019s foreign policy decision making after the incident of 9/11. This article asserts that in the early campaign of war on terrorism, Thaksin didn\u2019t realize the terrorist attacks as a threat towards Thailand\u2019s national security as much as the communist threat during the cold war. Nonetheless, Thaksin, a leader who has positive perceptions towards the U.S., was willing to support the American grand strategy entitled the war on terrorism, in open and secret ways.  In the first phase of the war on the terrorism, Thaksin declared that Thailand would remain strictly neutral; however, after the movements of terrorist groups in the Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand, Thaksin perceived it as a threat and decided to change Thailand\u2019s position from strictly neutral to extremely support the U.S. This article argues that the change of Thailand\u2019s foreign policy under Thaksin administration went beyond the notion concept of bending with the wind, according to the mainstream explanation of Thai diplomatic history.\tRather, it was the pattern of harmonization of interests between domestic and international politics, which ultimately pave the way to firmly restore the U.S. -

According to Gluckstein there were two parallel wars against the Axis Powers. One was an Imperialist War, waged by the ruling classes of Britain, the United States and Russia for their own interests, while the other war was a People\u2019s War against Fascism, waged by ordinary working people, many of them socialists. The two wars often overlapped in the minds of millions, but their aims were very different. We can see a kind of \u201cparallel war\u201d in the Red Shirt/UDD struggles against the military-royalist elites, where thousands of ordinary Red Shirts struggled for democracy, dignity and social justice, while Taksin and his political allies waged a very different campaign to regain the political influence that they had enjoyed before the 2006  coup d'\u00e9tat.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42961236, "asset_id": 22323606, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 39372383, "first_name": "Giles", "last_name": "Ungpakorn", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "GilesUngpakorn", "display_name": "Giles Ungpakorn", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/GilesUngpakorn?f_ri=344544", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/39372383/11674989/13017389/s65_giles.ungpakorn.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 99127, "name": "Thai politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_politics?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 344544, "name": "Thaksin Shinawatra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thaksin_Shinawatra?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 378519, "name": "Red Shirt in Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Red_Shirt_in_Thailand?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696565, "name": "Thai Political Crisis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Political_Crisis?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 43442942, "title": "Peasants and the redshirt movement in Thailand: some dissenting voices", "created_at": "2020-06-26T07:47:33.618-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43442942/Peasants_and_the_redshirt_movement_in_Thailand_some_dissenting_voices?f_ri=344544", "dom_id": "work_43442942", "summary": "The \u2018redshirt\u2019 movement in Thailand is commonly portrayed in media and scholarly accounts as a class-based, pro-Thaksin social movement that draws fervent support from the poor rural-born masses, especially peasants, in the north and northeast. The movement leaders, including Thaksin, have supposedly won these people\u2019s support by framing urban-based political elites as ammart (aristocrats) who have stakes in suppressing the needs of phrai (serfs) \u2013 a contrasting label for the rural-born poor. I question this analysis that highlights the polarisation of Thai society along class lines. Combining data from election results and fieldwork in Chiang Mai Province \u2013 Thaksin\u2019s birthplace and the putative redshirt heartland \u2013 I show that despite their relative poverty, some peasants remain cynical opponents of the redshirt movement. They have autonomy to penetrate and reinterpret the redshirts\u2019 class-centric collective action frame \u2013 a fact that cautions us against linking rural poverty causally to rural support for redshirts. Peasants are a more diverse, politically divided lot than we are led to believe. \n\nKeywords: Thailand; redshirt movement; framing; rural poverty; social class; peasants; Thaksin Shinawatra; Yingluck

specialist Iola Lenzi, this is apparently the first and largest\nregionally comprehensive curated exhibition (at the time of writing) to show at an institution outside of\nAsia. Roving Eye is also the third in a trilogy of SE Asian contemporary art exhibitions curated chiefly by\nLenzi and based on her nearly two decades worth of research and scholarship: 'Negotiating Home, History,\nNation: Two Decades of Contemporary Art in Southeast Asia, 1991-2011' and 'Concept, Context,\nContestation: Art and the Collective in Southeast Asia'.\n\nBoth exhibitions were curated in collaboration with Southeast Asian curators and deliberately sited within\nregional institutions so establishing SEA scholarship and art historical canon in Singapore in 2011 and\nBangkok in 2013, respectively. The art was naturally legible to audiences in Southeast Asia. Where\nNegotiating Home, History, Nation (NHHN) was an ambitious exhibition charting the region's art practices\nover two decades, Concept, Context, Contestation (CCC) further teased out SEA artists' conceptualist bent\nexamined within the ambit of Southeast Asian history. This was not to deny or refute external artistic\ninfluences (predominantly from the West) but to explore locally-rooted discourses that shaped practices\nand defined traits central to the region's art. Generalizing about Southeast Asia could be dangerous\nofcourse and as such the region cannot be viewed as a monolith wherein diverse contexts are uncritically\nlumped. This, Lenzi has been cautious of. In her various essays over nearly 20 years, she has cogently\nfactored in Southeast Asian countries' shared political awakening in the latter half of the 20th century and\nits implications on regional art history.\n\nAnd herein lay the potential risk of taking Southeast Asian art out into the world for a European and\npredominantly Turkish audience through The Roving Eye. As argued by the premise of previous exhibitions,\nif much of Southeast Asian contemporary art erupted from its volatile socio-political circumstances, would\nsuch art be legible to an audience unfamiliar with Southeast Asia?

This paper argues that these similarities\u2014the selective muzzling of the press, populist rhetoric and the ratification of redistributionist policies\u2014directly correlate with the strength and longevity of authoritarian regimes in the Philippines and Thailand, and that they were integral to the regime\u2019s popularity. This paper explores this argument by analyzing public statements from the Thaksin and Duterte administrations, their vilification of the press, and their populist economic policies. Furthermore, this paper will delegitimize the use of modernization theory in attempting to explain the long-lasting popularity of these two administrations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 93867524, "asset_id": 76133097, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 140211707, "first_name": "Alfonso Ralph", "last_name": "Mendoza Manalo", "domain_name": "utoronto", "page_name": "AlfonsoManalo", "display_name": "Alfonso Ralph Mendoza Manalo", "profile_url": "https://utoronto.academia.edu/AlfonsoManalo?f_ri=344544", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/140211707/111152004/100404925/s65_alfonso_ralph.mendoza_manalo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 796, "name": "Comparative Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Politics?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 899, "name": "Legitimacy and Authority", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Legitimacy_and_Authority?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 953, "name": "Rhetoric", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rhetoric?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=344544"}, {"id": 8785, "name": "Philippines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippines?f_ri=344544"}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=344544"}, {"id": 22559, "name": "Philippine Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Studies?f_ri=344544"}, {"id": 29268, "name": "Press Freedom", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Press_Freedom?f_ri=344544"}, {"id": 74352, "name": "Media Freedom", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Freedom?f_ri=344544"}, {"id": 96933, "name": "Politics in Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_in_Thailand?f_ri=344544"}, {"id": 344544, "name": "Thaksin Shinawatra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thaksin_Shinawatra?f_ri=344544"}, {"id": 2446159, "name": "Rodrigo Duterte", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rodrigo_Duterte?f_ri=344544"}]}, {"id": 50835068, "title": "De Thaksin a Yingluck: El Sistema Politico Tailandes en Encrucijada", "created_at": "2021-08-11T15:18:09.528-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/50835068/De_Thaksin_a_Yingluck_El_Sistema_Politico_Tailandes_en_Encrucijada?f_ri=344544", "dom_id": "work_50835068", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68702339, "asset_id": 50835068, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 197525190, "first_name": "Cintli", "last_name": "Cardenas", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "CardenasCintli", "display_name": "Cintli Cardenas", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/CardenasCintli?f_ri=344544", "photo": "https://gravatar.com/avatar/2f8bfe14921392fa1d419fd0491e5cb8?s=65"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 96933, "name": "Politics in Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_in_Thailand?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 344544, "name": "Thaksin Shinawatra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thaksin_Shinawatra?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 344549, "name": "Yingluck Shinawatra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yingluck_Shinawatra?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 378519, "name": "Red Shirt in Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Red_Shirt_in_Thailand?f_ri=344544", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 8479358, "title": "Thaksin bubble may be about to burst", "created_at": "2014-09-24T16:05:25.583-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8479358/Thaksin_bubble_may_be_about_to_burst?f_ri=344544", "dom_id": "work_8479358", "summary": "Today Singapore.
