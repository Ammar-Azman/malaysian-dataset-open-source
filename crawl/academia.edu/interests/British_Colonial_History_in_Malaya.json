tells the story of a group of radical Malay men and women from ordinary social backgrounds who chose to oppose foreign rule of their homeland, knowing full well that by embarking on this path of resistance, they would risk imprisonment or death. Their ranks included teachers, journalists, intellectuals, housewives, peasants, preachers, and youths. They formed, led, and contributed to the founding of political parties, grassroots organizations, unions, newspapers, periodicals, and schools that spread their ideas across the country in the aftermath of the Great Depression, when colonialism was at its height and evident in all areas of life in their country. But when their efforts to uproot foreign dominance faltered in the face of the sanctions the state imposed upon them, some of these radicals chose to take up arms, while others engaged in aggressive protests and acts of civil disobedience to uphold their rights. While some died fighting and hundreds were incarcerated, many lived to resist colonialism until their country attained its independence in August 1957, all of these Malay radicals were devoted to becoming free men and women and to claiming their right to be treated as equals in a world riddled with prejudice and contradictions. \n\nSyed Muhd Khairudin Aljunied\u2019s innovative study brings to light the less charted and unanalyzed terrain of the radical experience\u2014becoming and being radical. He argues that the experiences and histories of radicals in colonial Malaya can be elucidated in a more nuanced way by interrogating them alongside evolving local and global circumstances and by analyzing them through the lenses of a set of overarching and interconnected mobilizing concepts\u2014a set of ideas, visions, and notions that the radicals used to reason and justify their advent\u2014that were internalized, lived, and utilized in the course of their activism. These mobilizing concepts were their weapons and armor, employed to organize, strategize, protect, and consolidate themselves when menaced by the tentacles of the colonial state as they embarked upon the agonizing path towards independence. Those interested in Malaysian history, colonial history, radical movements, and resistance groups will enjoy this fascinating study.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40314733, "asset_id":

peacetime,\nwar, or a counterinsurgency operation. To develop better leaders\nfor the current counterinsurgency fight, let us look back at two highly successful leaders of the past. T.E. Lawrence, always a controversial figure, lived the life of an insurgent when he was posted as an advisor to the Arab forces fighting the Turkish Army during the Arab revolt of 1916-1918. General Sir Gerald Templer possessed the ideal leadership qualities necessary to defeat an insurgency and thus was able to shift the balance of power in favor of the British during the Malaya Emergency. Although both were great leaders, the two figures could not be more opposite. Lawrence was the eccentric misfit and Templer the essence of a proper British officer. Both, however, possessed a timeless trait our current leaders need in order to win in a counterinsurgency environment\u2014bold leadership. We can evaluate the quality of the leadership these two officers had using the Army framework of \u201cBe, Know, Do\u201d found in FM 22-100, Army Leadership.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58386058, "asset_id": 38334790, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14724730, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Sullivan", "domain_name": "tufts", "page_name": "MichaelSullivan", "display_name": "Michael Sullivan", "profile_url": "https://tufts.academia.edu/MichaelSullivan?f_ri=720132", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14724730/22397627/21605730/s65_michael.sullivan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2969, "name": "Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Leadership?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9451, "name": "Insurgency/Counterinsurgency(COIN)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Insurgency_Counterinsurgency_COIN_?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 98278, "name": "Military Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_Leadership?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 716849, "name": "T.E.

\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\nStudy on the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) should be an important part in the Malaysian Studies.  However,  due  to  difficulties  in  accessing  the  related  documents  or  target  group,  certain restrictions in the study and so on, lead to the slow development of CPM Studies, either in numbers of researcher or its research outcomes. As an ideological enemy, British colonial government in Malaya not only obtained large amounts of data and intelligence information of CPM, but also conducted lots of in-depth analysis and researched on CPM. It\u2019s believed that is the beginning of the CPM Studies. Since then, the CPM Studies were gradually expanded to the academia and civil sector. The CPM Studies mainly focused on CPM history, military strategy, organization structure, characteristic and so  on.  However,  most  of  the  early  CPM  Studies  were  relied  to  the  declassified  documents  which \npossess the official perspective, make the CPM research results a bit biased or unable to conduct in-depth  discussion  and  analysis  on  certain  issues  related  to  CPM. After  the  historical  Hadyai  Peace Accord signed on the 1989, many former CPM members started to publish their memoirs, released some important documents or even attending public events, etc., try to explore their past gradually to the public. Their efforts have provided more favorable conditions for the coming researchers. This paper attempts to give a brief reviews on CPM studies since 1930\u2019s and its research development and significance to Malaysian history, in order to raise more interest and attention among our community.\n\nKey Words:  Communist  Party  of  Malaya  (CPM),  CPM  Studies,  historical  materials,  declassified documents", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35132339, "asset_id": 8781208, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6478783, "first_name": "Kee Chye", "last_name": "Ho", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "KeeChyeHo", "display_name": "Kee Chye  Ho", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/KeeChyeHo?f_ri=720132", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6478783/2611527/13896255/s65_kee_chye.ho.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 442481, "name": "Malayan history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malayan_history?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 720132, "name": "British Colonial History in Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Colonial_History_in_Malaya?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1216970, "name": "The Malayan Emergency (1948-1960)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malayan_Emergency_1948-1960_?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1614766, "name": "Malayan Communist Party", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malayan_Communist_Party?f_ri=720132"}]}, {"id": 4098888, "title": "The Straits Chinese Magazine: A Malayan Voice", "created_at": "2013-07-24T15:43:50.903-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4098888/The_Straits_Chinese_Magazine_A_Malayan_Voice?f_ri=720132", "dom_id": "work_4098888", "summary": "By the late 19th century, a number of Straits Chinese, or Peranakans, had acquired status, wealth and academic standing.

normally is a private activity. However, reading leftist books will turn private activity into public. In order to keep left books from inciting young people to engage themselves in revolutionary work, publication censorship was tightened up. British authority kept a close watch on the leftists as they were prime mover in the revolt against the government, especially during the Malayan Emergency. Leading figure of Chinese leftist writers always become the top list of the selective examination. The selected research period, the Malayan Emergency and its subsequent effects, are the perfect background for the study. Malayan Emergency will be the main focus of this paper as it provides the most complicated and richest information in this case study. Discrimination against leftist books were common in that time. This paper hopes to unfold on the one hand the British Malayan and Malaysian publication censorship, with special examination of its policy to the communist printing. On the other hand, it analyses the ways intellectuals convey their \"revolt\" to the rigid policy.\n\nKeywords: Malayan Emergency\uff1bCold War\uff1bChinese Communist Party\uff1bLeftist\uff1bHistory of Banned Books\n\n#\u5de6\u7ffc #\u99ac\u5171 #\u9b6f\u8fc5 #Darurat Tanah Melayu\n\n\u58f9\u3001\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u7981\u66f8\uff1f\n\u8cb3\u3001\u89e3\u78bc\u904a\u6232\n\u53c1\u3001\u8b14\u800c\u8650\n\u8086\u3001\u53cd\uff08\u4e2d\uff09\u5171\n\u9918\u8ad6\uff1a\u99ac\u5171\u5c0d\u7f75\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61030230, "asset_id": 40326023, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 68603808, "first_name": "Th'ng", "last_name": "Bee Fu \u65b9\u7f8e\u5bcc", "domain_name": "utar", "page_name": "ThngBeeFu", "display_name": "Th'ng Bee Fu \u65b9\u7f8e\u5bcc", "profile_url": "https://utar.academia.edu/ThngBeeFu?f_ri=720132", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/68603808/17926080/17940207/s65_th_ng.bee_fu_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 876, "name": "Print Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Print_Culture?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 966, "name": "Censorship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Censorship?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2340, "name": "Book History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Book_History?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 3652, "name": "Cultural Cold War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Cold_War?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 5214, "name": "Cold War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cold_War?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 16542, "name": "Cryptography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cryptography?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 60514, "name": "Jokes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jokes?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 150548, "name": "Chinese Communist Party", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Communist_Party?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 235053, "name": "Banned Books", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Banned_Books?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 361743, "name": "Publication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Publication?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 442481, "name": "Malayan history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malayan_history?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 720132, "name": "British Colonial History in Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Colonial_History_in_Malaya?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 980111, "name": "Left Wing Parties", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Left_Wing_Parties?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 1216970, "name": "The Malayan Emergency (1948-1960)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malayan_Emergency_1948-1960_?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 1614766, "name": "Malayan Communist Party", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malayan_Communist_Party?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 1974261, "name": "Malaysian Chinese Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Chinese_Education?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 2883509, "name": "Malaysian Chinese (Mahua) Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Chinese_Mahua_Literature?f_ri=720132"}]}, {"id": 45661032, "title": "PKMM -UMNO Sebuah Perbandingan dalam Perjuangan dan Kesannya kepada Gerakan Nasionalisme di Tanah Melayu", "created_at": "2021-04-01T20:12:40.282-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45661032/PKMM_UMNO_Sebuah_Perbandingan_dalam_Perjuangan_dan_Kesannya_kepada_Gerakan_Nasionalisme_di_Tanah_Melayu?f_ri=720132", "dom_id": "work_45661032", "summary": "Artikel ini mengupas mengenai senario politik semenanjung Tanah Melayu selepas Perang Dunia Kedua yang digerakkan oleh dua buah pertubuhan politik yang sangat berpengaruh iaitu Parti Kebangsaan Melayu Malaya (PKMM) dan juga United Malay National Organisation (UMNO).

Yet Lim remains a poorly understood figure because of a lack of sources and a historiography written almost entirely from his opponents\u2019 perspectives. Reassessing existing literature in view of recently declassified British archives, this essay pieces together Lim\u2019s articulation of three tenets in the political thinking that guided his tactics for social mobilisation: anticolonial unity, non-violence, and popular sovereignty. Lim put these principles into practice with great success, becoming the leader of the largest and most formative nationalist movement Singapore has ever known. Understanding Malayan nationalism in Singapore \u2013 and its successor, Singaporean nationalism \u2013 is thus impossible without understanding Lim Chin Siong.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

Except for the various Peranakan communities which predated British colonialism, there is little evidence in current scholarly research to show that consistent interaction, friendships, and even intermarriages took place in the first few decades following 1819. This article will examine new evidence about multiracial Roman Catholic communities, starting in the early 1830s, showing how intermarriages were extremely commonplace and possible reasons behind this development. This research also inadvertently uncovers the creation of a native Peranakan bloodline starting from 1833, specific to Singapore.

From the United States\u2019 failures in Vietnam to the current battles against jihadist networks in the Middle East, the United States continues to struggle with an implementation of strategy. Britain\u2019s experience combatting the Malayan Communist Party in the 1950\u2019s should be used as a model example for successful counterinsurgency strategy due to the timely and effective pacification of the communist insurgents that threatened Malaya\u2019s stability. This thesis utilizes a case study approach to explore whether it was successful counterinsurgency strategy that influenced Britain\u2019s quick success, or whether there were other factors at play that influenced the pacification efforts in Malaya. These factors will then be compared to the United States\u2019 continual efforts over time to master the art of counterinsurgency, shedding light on the failures of the U.S. and where strategists went wrong. This study suggests that the United States is in dire need of re-evaluating its current strategy, and must learn to adapt to new threats by learning from others and branching from its conventional

The former revealed connections between Haji Mat Karae (who led the Dusun Nyoir rebellion) and Kyai Salleh active in Batu Pahat before the return of the British in 1945.

Under British colonial authorities\u2019 formidable encirclement strategy, the CPM gradually retreated to southern Thailand in 1950 to set up new bases. The CPM in its retreat began to scale down military force and personnel. With the evolvement of international affairs in mid 1950s, the CPM further suspended its military activities. In the early 1960s, the issue of the Malaysia Project and the change of international circumstances prompted the CPM to declare the New Directive in which it redefined its direction of struggle and persisted in the path of armed struggle. While the New Directive enabled CPM to gradually revitalize its military strength, Malaysia\u2019s internal political conflicts were also worsening, which allowed the CPM to take further action. In 1963, in preparation for its southward advance, the CPM identified clearly \u201cneo-colonialism\u201d and its agent, the \u201cMalaysian\u201d regime, as its new targets of struggle. In mid 1960s, the Struggle against the Counter-revolution incidents broke out within CPM, triggering a political and military crisis in the party, which split into three factions. When the first Struggle against Counterrevolution ended, the CPM issued \u201cRaise High the Great Red Flag and March on with Courage\u201d on 1 June 1968, an important statement announcing officially its readiness to send troops southward. It took the CPM seven years (1961\u20131968) to adjust and prepare itself before officially launching its assault teams southward on 29 March 1968, which marked a new milestone in CPM\u2019s historical development. This article is of the view that the CPM\u2019s southward advance strategy is significant and impactful for the CPM in three aspects: (1) it extended the history of the CPM\u2019s armed struggle; (2) it provided the CPM\u2019s armed struggle with momentum; and (3) it reinforced the authoritarian regime in Malaysia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44878014, "asset_id": 24547199, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6478783, "first_name": "Kee Chye", "last_name": "Ho", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "KeeChyeHo", "display_name": "Kee Chye  Ho", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/KeeChyeHo?f_ri=720132", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6478783/2611527/13896255/s65_kee_chye.ho.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7443, "name": "Communism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communism?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 720132, "name": "British Colonial History in Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Colonial_History_in_Malaya?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1614766, "name": "Malayan Communist Party", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malayan_Communist_Party?f_ri=720132"}]}, {"id": 5347378, "title": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u6c11\u4e3b\u540c\u76df\u5728\u65b0\u9a6c\uff1a\u6218\u540e\u5357\u6d0b\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u4e00\u9875", "created_at": "2013-12-07T02:01:28.142-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5347378/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E5%90%8C%E7%9B%9F%E5%9C%A8%E6%96%B0%E9%A9%AC_%E6%88%98%E5%90%8E%E5%8D%97%E6%B4%8B%E8%A2%AB%E9%81%97%E5%BF%98%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%80%E9%A1%B5?f_ri=720132", "dom_id": "work_5347378", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32501016, "asset_id": 5347378, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7350157, "first_name": "Yoeng Jiann", "last_name": "Tan \uff08\u9673\u52c7\u5065\uff09", "domain_name": "thu", "page_name": "YoengJiannTan", "display_name": "Yoeng Jiann  Tan \uff08\u9673\u52c7\u5065\uff09", "profile_url": "https://thu.academia.edu/YoengJiannTan?f_ri=720132", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7350157/2718695/12252489/s65_yoeng_jiann.tan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 21219, "name": "Socialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socialism?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 603470, "name": "Revolutionary United Front", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Revolutionary_United_Front?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 720132, "name": "British Colonial History in Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Colonial_History_in_Malaya?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 974569, "name": "Nationalism In China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism_In_China?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 1159070, "name": "Communist Party of China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communist_Party_of_China?f_ri=720132"}]}, {"id": 5509050, "title": "\u201cTerribly Severe though Mercifully Short: The Episode of the 1918 Influenza in British Malaya\u201d in Modern Asian Studies, 41 (2).

The Special Branch\u2019s bravado, glimpsed only perfunctorily in the colonial record, conceal a far more contingent process from which the colonial establishment and various institutions and individuals under its ambit contended, arrested but never arrived at an unequivocal appreciation of the Communist threat in its midst. In this sense, the British and their formative encounters with Communism in the aftermath of the Great War are meritorious of scholarly attention. Colonial officials came face-to-face with a revolutionary ideology still revelling in its newfound, post-war international prestige and understandably, located its insidious influence in the local Chinese diaspora. That set the stage for the British and their showdown with their pro-Communist Hainanese subordinates at Kreta Ayer. The colonial government was disgraced there, and only then was anti-Communist policy placed firmly under the Special Branch\u2019s purview. Yet, the rot did not stop there. The Special Branch consistently agonised in the early 1930s over the fledgling Malayan Communist Party (MCP) and its international affiliations and only through due diligence, emasculated it. The rest of the colonial government, on the other hand, was increasingly privy to Malayan Communism and its local grievances. The sheer complexity of local problems in the run-up to the Second World War, of which Communism was integral, finally threw into sharp relief these differences in appraisal of the Communist threat within the colonial government. The story of the British and their rendezvous with pre-war Malayan Communism, indeed, was one of liminalities and ambiguities, directed not only towards the Communist follower but at the heart of the colonial edifice as well.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58532478, "asset_id": 38467545, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51097579, "first_name": "James", "last_name": "Mah", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "JamesMah", "display_name": "James Mah", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/JamesMah?f_ri=720132", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51097579/22706709/21879654/s65_james.mah.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7443, "name": "Communism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communism?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52197, "name": "Colonial Discourse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Discourse?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 77501, "name": "Anti-communism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anti-communism?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 442481, "name": "Malayan history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malayan_history?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 720132, "name": "British Colonial History in Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Colonial_History_in_Malaya?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 749811, "name": "British Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Malaya?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 1614766, "name": "Malayan Communist Party", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malayan_Communist_Party?f_ri=720132"}]}, {"id": 24549039, "title": "\u7565\u8bba\u9a6c\u6765\u4e9a\u6c11\u65cf\u89e3\u653e\u9635\u7ebf\u7684\u6210\u7acb\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55/A Brief Account of the Founding and Development of Malayan National Liberation Front", "created_at": "2016-04-19T00:59:35.869-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24549039/%E7%95%A5%E8%AE%BA%E9%A9%AC%E6%9D%A5%E4%BA%9A%E6%B0%91%E6%97%8F%E8%A7%A3%E6%94%BE%E9%98%B5%E7%BA%BF%E7%9A%84%E6%88%90%E7%AB%8B%E4%B8%8E%E5%8F%91%E5%B1%95_A_Brief_Account_of_the_Founding_and_Development_of_Malayan_National_Liberation_Front?f_ri=720132", "dom_id": "work_24549039", "summary": "1950\u5e74\u4ee3\uff0c\u9a6c\u6765\u4e9a\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\uff08\u9a6c\u5171\uff09\u9010\u6e10\u5f80\u5317\u64a4\u79bb\u4ee5\u5316\u89e3\u82f1\u56fd\u6b96\u6c11\u5730\u653f\u5e9c\u519b\u7684\u519b\u4e8b\u6253\u538b\u30021955\u5e74\uff0c\u9a6c\u5171\u548c\u4ee5\u4e1c\u59d1\u963f\u90fd\u62c9\u66fc\u4e3a\u4ee3\u8868\u7684\u201c\u534e\u73b2\u4f1a\u8c08\u201d\u5931\u8d25\u4ee5\u540e\uff0c\u9a6c\u5171\u4fbf\u9009\u62e9\u5728\u9a6c\u6cf0\u8fb9\u533a\u5efa\u7acb\u6839\u636e\u5730\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u4f1a\u4f7f\u5230\u56fd\u5185\u7684\u6c11\u8fd0\u53ca\u7fa4\u4f17\u9010\u6e10\u758f\u79bb\u9a6c\u5171\u30021960\u5e74\u4ee5\u540e\uff0c\u9a6c\u6765\u897f\u4e9a\u56fd\u5185\u7684\u5c40\u52bf\u9aa4\u53d8\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u5f53\u5c40\u7684\u5f3a\u529b\u6253\u538b\uff0c\u7559\u5b88\u56fd\u5185\u7684\u6c11\u8fd0\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u8fb9\u533a\u7684\u9a6c\u5171\u5931\u53bb\u4e86\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u7ee7\u7eed\u53cd\u6b96\u6597\u4e89\uff0c\u9a6c\u6765\u4e9a\u6c11\u65cf\u89e3\u653e\u9635\u7ebf\uff08\u89e3\u9635\uff09\u4e8e1968\u5e7411\u670825\u65e5\u6210\u7acb\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u548c\u9a6c\u5171\u53d6\u5f97\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u9a6c\u5171\u7684\u5730\u4e0b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002\u89e3\u9635\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u9002\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9a6c\u5171\u6700\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u8865\u7ed9\u3002\u9a6c\u5171\u57281960\u5e74\u4ee3\u4ee5\u540e\u7684\u6b66\u88c5\u6597\u4e89\u5f97\u4ee5\u5ef6\u7eed\u81f31989\u5e74\uff0c\u89e3\u9635\u53ef\u8bf4\u662f\u626e\u6f14\u7740\u6781\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u503c\u5f97\u6211\u4eec\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53bb\u6df1\u7a76\u3002\nAbstract\nThe Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) gradually withdrew to the north in the 1950\u2019s as a strategy to overcome the British Military Administration of Malaya suppression. In 1955, after the \u201cBaling Talks\u201d held between the CPM and the Malayan Government headed by Tunku Abdul Rahman failed, the CPM opted for building bases in the Thai-Malaysian border, even though such a move would cut off its contact with the Ming Yun and the masses. After 1960, the political situation in Malaysia changed dramatically. This change coupled with the relentless suppression of the government, the underground organisations lost contact with the CPM. To carry on their anti-colonialism struggle, the establishment of the Malayan National Liberation Front (MNLF) on 25 November 1968 and its successful link up with the CPM as the CPM underground organisation had timely provided the CPM the basic and significant supply line, the strength of CPM expanded rapidly, although after 1960 the CPM had reestablished its contact with some people in Malaysia. Consequently, the armed struggle of CPM since 1960\u2019s could sustain up to 1989. It can be said that the MNLF contributed and played a very important and tremendous role. It is the point which is worth the researchers carrying out further study.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44879633, "asset_id": 24549039, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6478783, "first_name": "Kee Chye", "last_name": "Ho", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "KeeChyeHo", "display_name": "Kee Chye  Ho", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/KeeChyeHo?f_ri=720132", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6478783/2611527/13896255/s65_kee_chye.ho.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13910, "name": "Chinese Communism and Left-wing Movement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Communism_and_Left-wing_Movement?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 214532, "name": "Communist Parties", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communist_Parties?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 442481, "name": "Malayan history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malayan_history?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 720132, "name": "British Colonial History in Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Colonial_History_in_Malaya?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 1614766, "name": "Malayan Communist Party", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malayan_Communist_Party?f_ri=720132"}]}, {"id": 45129696, "title": "\"Not the Oil of the Country\": Smallholders and British Malaya's Oil Palm Industry, 1929-1941.

Historians have usually stressed post\u2013harvest coordination challenges stemming from a combination of quality requirements, processing cost economies, and crop-specific time sensitivity. On balance, evidence suggests that crop coordination challenges were the chief obstacle to Malayan smallholder involvement in oil palms before the 1950s. Unlike for estates, however, coordination problems for smallholders were more likely underwritten by the draw of competing crops, labor demands, and subsistence cultures. Given these challenges, local dealer participation was critical to fostering workable smallholder oil palm initiatives.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65899356, "asset_id": 45129696, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2695259, "first_name": "Geoffrey", "last_name": "Pakiam", "domain_name": "iseaslib", "page_name": "GeoffreyPakiam", "display_name": "Geoffrey K Pakiam", "profile_url": "https://iseaslib.academia.edu/GeoffreyPakiam?f_ri=720132", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2695259/3193298/43320832/s65_geoffrey.pakiam.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3722, "name": "Environmental History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_History?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19923, "name": "Agricultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agricultural_History?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25636, "name": "Smallholder Farmers & Poverty Alleviation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Smallholder_Farmers_and_Poverty_Alleviation?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 90176, "name": "Palm Oil Plantation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Palm_Oil_Plantation?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 235694, "name": "Malaysian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_history?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 259330, "name": "Palm Oil", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Palm_Oil?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 720132, "name": "British Colonial History in Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Colonial_History_in_Malaya?f_ri=720132"}]}, {"id": 20305359, "title": "Legal Transplants and Adaptation in a Colonial Setting: Company Law in British Malaya", "created_at": "2016-01-16T02:19:39.958-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/20305359/Legal_Transplants_and_Adaptation_in_a_Colonial_Setting_Company_Law_in_British_Malaya?f_ri=720132", "dom_id": "work_20305359", "summary": "This paper traces the development of company law during the colonial era in British Malaya, providing details on the laws of the Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay States.

Ed. Farish A. Noor & Peter Carey. Amsterdam: AUP, 15 January 2021\n\nThe colonisation of Southeast Asia was a long and often violent process where numerous military campaigns were waged by the colonial powers across the region. The notion of racial difference was crucial in many of\nthese wars, as native Southeast Asian societies were often framed in negative terms as 'savage' and 'backward' communities that needed to be subdued and 'civilised'. This collection of critical essays focuses on the colonial construction of race and looks at how the colonial wars\nin 19th-century Southeast Asia were rationalised via recourse to theories of racial difference, making race a significant factor in the wars of Empire. Looking at the colonial wars in Java, Borneo, Siam, the Philippines, the Malay Peninsula and other parts of Southeast Asia, the\nessays examine the manner in which the idea of racial difference was weaponised by the colonising powers and how forms of local resistance often worked through such colonial structures of identity politics.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65515543, "asset_id":

"dom_id": "work_48923920", "summary": "Grand exhibitions of commerce and manufacture were key events for the British Empire\u2019s economy. The British Empire Exhibition of 1924\u20131925, for example, was expressly intended to reinvigorate British and colonial markets after the First World War by encouraging inter-colonial trade. This exhibition shaped appearances of wealth, industry and development throughout the empire with its regionally styled pavilion architecture, model villages, craft and industry displays, and ephemera. However, this event, and others like it, also drew prominent attention to the relationships between the peoples within the empire, shaping imperial subjecthood and proto-nationalism, and revealing conflicting ideas of identity construction. This paper examines the representations of British Malaya and North Borneo at the British Empire Exhibition, comparing them to those of the Malaya-Borneo Exhibition, a lesser-known event held in Singapore in 1922. It discusses how British administrators portrayed the material and cultural values of the region in relation to their wider economic and developmental programmes.\n\nThe British Empire Exhibition\u2019s Malaya and Sarawak pavilions collected a number of separate colonies, states and companies together as two distinct entities, beginning a process of unifying the region and defining the identity of its peoples. In placing this exhibition alongside the localised Malaya-Borneo Exhibition, we see how these territories adapted their economic and cultural identities between different regional and global scales. These events show the shaping of a Malay identity alongside the effects of British modernisation, and how raw materials, regional crafts, and inter-colonial relations were re-cast for an international stage. The paper contributes to our understanding of how early twentieth century exhibitions sought to transform regional economies and identities, and how value was ascribed to the material culture of British Southeast Asia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67327735, "asset_id": 48923920, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51943143, "first_name": "Jesse", "last_name": "O'Neill", "domain_name": "chelseaspace", "page_name": "JesseONeill", "display_name": "Jesse O'Neill", "profile_url": "https://chelseaspace.academia.edu/JesseONeill?f_ri=720132", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51943143/46031870/35700773/s65_jesse.o_neill.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1632, "name": "Design History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Design_History?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 226095, "name": "History of Exhibitions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Exhibitions?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 720132, "name": "British Colonial History in Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Colonial_History_in_Malaya?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 43560266, "title": "Review of Marjorie Doggett\u2019s Singapore: A Photographic Record, by Edward Stokes", "created_at": "2020-07-08T18:13:05.050-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43560266/Review_of_Marjorie_Doggett_s_Singapore_A_Photographic_Record_by_Edward_Stokes?f_ri=720132", "dom_id": "work_43560266", "summary": "Book Review", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63868050, "asset_id": 43560266, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 185762, "first_name": "James", "last_name": "McArdle", "domain_name": "deakin", "page_name": "JamesMcArdle", "display_name": "James M McArdle", "profile_url": "https://deakin.academia.edu/JamesMcArdle?f_ri=720132", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/185762/45538/41910/s65_james.mcardle.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16549, "name": "Architecture And Photography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture_And_Photography?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19022, "name": "Documentary Photography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Documentary_Photography?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20079, "name": "History of photography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_photography?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 27665, "name": "Photography (Visual Studies)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Photography_Visual_Studies_?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 35203, "name": "Colonial Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Architecture?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 201384, "name": "Theory and politics of multiculturalism, ethno-religious identities, national identity, Islamophobia, soci-economic disadvantage  and secularism, with especial reference to British Asian Muslims.", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theory_and_politics_of_multiculturalism_ethno-religious_identities_national_identity_Islamophobia?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 394375, "name": "British diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_diaspora?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 720132, "name": "British Colonial History in Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Colonial_History_in_Malaya?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 728740, "name": "Amateur Photography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amateur_Photography?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 995460, "name": "Colonial Architecture In South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Architecture_In_South_Asia?f_ri=720132"}]}, {"id": 42385708, "title": "Lost in Mobility?

Prior to the 1894 reform, people in Malaya used customary scales and weight units, which varied across districts, for commercial transactions. Initiated by colonial administrators, the reform was both welcomed and resisted. In 1897, a riot against the Sanitary Board broke out in Kuala Lumpur for its attempt to mandate that previously exempted traders use only government verified and stamped scales. The colonial government managed to maintain order and restore its authority at the end of the riot, but four types of merchants \u2013 goldsmiths, silversmiths, opium dealers and drug sellers \u2013 managed to remain exempted. Metrological reform continued to be contested in the following century, but the central concerns of the regulation moved from easing taxation, facilitating cross district trade and taming Chinese traders to protecting consumers. More emphasis was placed on educating the public to be able to read scales, in addition to using police force to raid businesses. The enforcement was, however, compromised due to inadequate fund. The reality on the ground contradicts the image of an omnipresent colonial authority and reveals the fragility of colonial administration.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67619615, "asset_id": 49235570, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2556253, "first_name": "Por", "last_name": "Heong Hong", "domain_name": "usm", "page_name": "PorHeongHong", "display_name": "Por Heong Hong", "profile_url": "https://usm.academia.edu/PorHeongHong?f_ri=720132", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2556253/797698/41186930/s65_por.heong_hong.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 286273, "name": "Colonial Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Governance?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 399960, "name": "Rumour", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rumour?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 560682, "name": "Historical Metrology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Metrology?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 720132, "name": "British Colonial History in Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Colonial_History_in_Malaya?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 45185900, "title": "\u4e8c\u6230\u6642\uff0c\u8207\u65e5\u8ecd\u5357\u4e0b\u99ac\u4f86\u4e9e\u7684\u300c\u7375\u864e\u6bbf\u4e0b\u300d\u2500\u2500\u5fb7\u5ddd\u7fa9\u89aa", "created_at": "2021-02-24T19:17:12.420-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45185900/%E4%BA%8C%E6%88%B0%E6%99%82_%E8%88%87%E6%97%A5%E8%BB%8D%E5%8D%97%E4%B8%8B%E9%A6%AC%E4%BE%86%E4%BA%9E%E7%9A%84_%E7%8D%B5%E8%99%8E%E6%AE%BF%E4%B8%8B_%E5%BE%B7%E5%B7%9D%E7%BE%A9%E8%A6%AA?f_ri=720132", "dom_id": "work_45185900", "summary": "Probably no one had any clear idea about what's happened during Japanese-occupation era,and mostly what we heard of or what we have been reading,are biases and horrifying tragedies during that era,especially for the chinese descendants, no doubt of it.But there was a person named #TokugawaYoshichika, a Marquis, one of an offsprings of the famous Shogunate of Japan, being designated and sent to Malaya as advisor to the Gunsei(Japanese army administration) government in Syonan (present day Singapore) as his wishes to.

Within counterinsurgency circles, the Emergency is hailed as a success of the \u201chearts and minds\u201d doctrine, which prescribes civil efforts that win over the population over harsher military measures. Newer historical and political scholarship criticises this contention and argues that the Emergency was won by \u201cpopulation control\u201d efforts, which required locking down the civilian population in order to deny support and supplies to the Communist insurgents. Social and cultural factors have largely been passed over in scholarship of the Emergency in favour of political and military explanations of the conflict. More specifically, this paper examines the Emergency through the concept of diaspora, arguing that the course of the conflict was driven by socio-cultural factors stemming from the complex relationship between successive British colonial governments and the Chinese population of Malaya.

In earlier times its history was tightly knit to the development and prosperity of its port. Today\u2019s global trading hub, however, is broadly conditioned by its position within a global communications regime that includes various modes of transportation by sea, land and air, as well as electronic forms of communication such as telephony and the internet. Transport and telecommunications infrastructure are certainly prerequisites for success, but Singapore\u2019s rapid rise in becoming a global trading hub cannot be explained by these factors alone: the hub is backed by an array of industries that directly or indirectly support transport and trade at large, ranging from warehousing to finance and trade. All these activities, moreover, are regulated and driven by policies that have been carefully formulated and put into place over the past five decades. Then there is Singapore\u2019s greatest asset today: its people. In the context of this introduction, it is of course impossible to give a detailed or even comprehensive overview of the historical developments that have evolved and today underpin the global trading hub. What is possible, however, is to single out some of the developmental highlights as well as explain their historic relevance and interdependence. In the following sections I shall do so with an eye cast on history and chronological development as well as moving from the larger picture to the particular.

Where did their loyalties belong? To the British Empire, a declining relic of the past but of which they were subjects and to which they had owed much of their success? To the Malayan nation, a concept just beginning to take shape? Or to China, the homeland of their ancestors? As a community that occupied the space between the Chinese, Malay and British worlds, the Peranakan were caught between competing visions of the future in a period of dramatic change as nationalisms intensified and the process of decolonisation swept the world. This paper focuses on how the Peranakan reacted to this central question of loyalty and belonging as a community that existed within and between increasingly fracturing worlds. How did they respond to the challenge of being caught between the British Empire and competing forms of nationalism emerging in Malaya at the time (i.e. Malayan nationalism, Malay nationalism and Chinese nationalism)? What steps did they take to ensure the political, economic and cultural survival of their community?", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34765810, "first_name": "Bernard", "last_name": "Keo", "domain_name": "latrobe", "page_name": "BernardKeo", "display_name": "Bernard Z Keo", "profile_url": "https://latrobe.academia.edu/BernardKeo?f_ri=720132", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/34765810/10140856/21850235/s65_bernard.keo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11358, "name": "Secession", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Secession?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 307448, "name": "Peranakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 720132, "name": "British Colonial History in Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Colonial_History_in_Malaya?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 77650657, "title": "A colonial cash cow: the return on investments in British Malaya, 1889\u20131969", "created_at": "2022-04-26T02:35:26.613-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77650657/A_colonial_cash_cow_the_return_on_investments_in_British_Malaya_1889_1969?f_ri=720132", "dom_id": "work_77650657", "summary": "Historical rates of return on investments have received increasing scholarly attention in recent years. Much literature has focused especially on colonies, where institutions have been argued to facilitate severe exploitation. In the present study, we examine the return on investments in an Asian colony, British Malaya, from 1889 to 1969 for a large sample of companies. Our results suggest that the return on investments in Malaya might have been among the highest in the world during the period studied. Nevertheless, this finding fits badly with theories of imperial exploitation and can only to a limited extent be explained by a higher risk premium. Instead, we argue that the main driver of the very high return on investments in Malaya was rather the substantial rise in global market prices of the output of the two main sectors of the Malayan economy, rubber and tin. The way that the process of decolonization unfolded in Malaya did, furthermore, not lead to any major nationalization ...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84963222, "asset_id": 77650657,

discourse within the Methodist Church.

Discourses such as Dravidian Nationalism, Eastern Nationalism, and even the Methodist Church itself were influential in creating oppositional space and fostering intellectual freedom at a time when such expressions were frowned upon. This study thus challenges the perception that middle-class Indian communities were so pro-British that others often derogatorily referred to them as \"Black Europeans\".", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63567763, "asset_id": 43290982, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 927340, "first_name": "Marc", "last_name": "Sebastian Rerceretnam", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MarcRerceretnam", "display_name": "Marc Sebastian Rerceretnam", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MarcRerceretnam?f_ri=720132", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/927340/45006443/35239460/s65_marc.rerceretnam.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 109, "name": "Christianity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christianity?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5273, "name": "Class", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Class?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7664, "name": "Religious Conversion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Conversion?f_ri=720132", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10453, "name": "Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminism?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 118633, "name": "Caste", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caste?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 257546, "name": "Methodist Church history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Methodist_Church_history?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 320120, "name": "Dravidian Movement &tamil Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dravidian_Movement_and_tamil_Nationalism?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 483103, "name": "Anticolonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anticolonialism?f_ri=720132"}, {"id": 720132, "name": "British Colonial History in Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Colonial_History_in_Malaya?f_ri=720132"}]}, {"id": 43290957, "title": "Intermarriage in colonial Malaya and Singapore: A case study of nineteenth-and early twentieth-century Roman Catholic and Methodist Asian communities", "created_at": "2020-06-08T15:06:40.533-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43290957/Intermarriage_in_colonial_Malaya_and_Singapore_A_case_study_of_nineteenth_and_early_twentieth_century_Roman_Catholic_and_Methodist_Asian_communities?f_ri=720132", "dom_id": "work_43290957", "summary": "Colonial race relations are regularly portrayed in light of the attempts to divide and rule colonialised Asian communities.
