Although women are not the only actors in the movement, but their partaking presents an interesting feature. Their involvement in the resistance has become an icon that provides a basis for labelling the contemporary anti-cement movement as the struggle of \"Kartinis of Kendeng\", linking it with Indonesia's national heroine of the region who has struggled for liberating women from the prison of tradition.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59387462, "asset_id": 39254793, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 39122404, "first_name": "IAEME", "last_name": "Publication", "domain_name": "iaeme", "page_name": "publication", "display_name": "IAEME Publication", "profile_url": "https://iaeme.academia.edu/publication?f_ri=1250137", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/39122404/12178523/13563629/s65_iaeme.publication.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8882, "name": "Women", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women?f_ri=1250137", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23206, "name": "Environmental Activism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Activism?f_ri=1250137", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1250137, "name": "Central Java", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Central_Java?f_ri=1250137", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2586166, "name": "Forms of resistance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forms_of_resistance?f_ri=1250137", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3201651, "name": "Anti-Cement Movement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anti-Cement_Movement?f_ri=1250137"}]}, {"id": 6053585, "title": "(2014) Mobile mediators and inbetweener importers: The normalization of strangeness in Muslim Southeast Asia.

In Aceh, for example, did recently arrived Arabs from Aden play key roles in the processes of \"Islamisation?\" While few claim rank outsiders to have been crucial in chapters of significant religious change, in this paper I argue that neither are individuals\u23afalbeit inadequately\u23afdescribed as insiders. Accounts provided by historians done with dissecting the dynamics of religious change note the presence of multi-lingual and mobile mediators, who have been described as \"inbetweeners\", who were adept at importing new ideas\u23afincluding ways of dealing with the divine. Commerce across the Indian Ocean both before and after the rise in European presence centred on ports where being different was normal. Pre-colonial port-cities produced ethnolinguistical \u201ccreole\u201d or \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d communities whose comfort with ethnoreligious diversity is lamentable scarce in present-day South and Southeast Asia. This paper considers the role of \u201cmobile mediators\u201d and \u201cinbetweeners\u201d in the importation of a range of Islamic movements in Thailand. I make suggestions about the personalities and processes through which ideas espoused by Imam Al-Ghazali (1058\u20131111), Sheikh Ahmad Ibn Idris (1760-1837), and Muhammad \u2018Abduh (1849-1905) become known in Thai/Malay Peninsula.

This article analyses this policy, specifically the National Mental Health Legislation (2014) and the Ministry of Health Regulation Tackling Forcible Restraint of People with Mental Illness (2017), and evaluates their current state of implementation through a local, in-depth case study. Using mental health institution mapping, two sets of semi-structured qualitative interviews with government officials and healthcare workers, and participant observation in a facility practicing Pasung, we identify the extent to which the 2017 regulation has been implemented in Winong village and discuss current efforts and persistent obstacles to eradicating Pasung. We suggest that despite reforms and the new treatment facility in our case study, the continuing use of Pasung is due to a combination of access to care issues and a widely held explanatory model of
