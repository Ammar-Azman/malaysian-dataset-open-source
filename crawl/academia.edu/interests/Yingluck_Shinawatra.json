Contemporary feminist scholarship has centered on how women use new media technologies to serve political agendas. However, this literature focuses predominantly on women in the West, while women in developing countries, or Asia more generally, have been largely excluded from analysis. This article aims to fill this gap by examining Thai women's online activities during the 2013/2014 Bangkok political protests.

But it was not the last coup Thailand had experienced. In May 2014, the military staged another coup overthrowing the elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra (2011-2014). Yingluck is sister of Thaksin. Months before, anti-government protesters took control of business districts in Bangkok while putting pressure on Yingluck who was attempting to pass an Amnesty Bill that could set her brother free from corruption charges. The protests paved the way for the military to once again intervene in politics and suggested that the army\u2019s political interests seemed to align with those of the protesters. Currently, Thailand is under the custody of the military regime of Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha, former army chief and leader of the coup makers. The enduring political crisis has effectively shaped the contour of the country\u2019s foreign policy, especially in its relations with the great powers. The crisis has also provided a vital platform for these powers\u2014in this case, the United States and China, to compete with each other in order to influence the behaviour and policy of Thailand at a time when the country has been experiencing political turbulence. It is however imperative to explain in a wider context the role of Washington and Beijing in Thailand\u2019s protracted crisis and their competition for power and supremacy in Southeast Asia. Thailand continues to serve as a \u201cstrategic depot\u201d for the two great powers to consolidate their sphere of influence in this part of the world. From this perspective, it can be argued that the Thai political situation has further intensified the level of competition between the United States and China, which has in turn readjusted the overall balance of power in Southeast Asia. This paper examines the different approaches of the United States and China in dealing with the Thai crisis. It asks: Which approach is more effective in the attempt to win the Thai influence? It investigates the way in which the competition between the two great powers has come to dominate Thailand\u2019s foreign affairs. In the final section, the paper briefly discusses the standing of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Thailand\u2019s polarised politics and seeks to elucidate whether Thailand has been able to exploit its position in ASEAN to dilute the overwhelming power of the United States and China over its domestic and foreign affairs.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38846365, "asset_id": 16001745, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 840326, "first_name": "Southeast Asia Research Centre", "last_name": "CityU", "domain_name": "cityu-hk", "page_name": "searc", "display_name": "Southeast Asia Research Centre CityU", "profile_url": "https://cityu-hk.academia.edu/searc?f_ri=344549", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/840326/295979/350173/s65_southeast_asia.cityu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=344549", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38972, "name": "ASEAN", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN?f_ri=344549", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 96933, "name": "Politics in Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_in_Thailand?f_ri=344549", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 344544, "name": "Thaksin Shinawatra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thaksin_Shinawatra?f_ri=344549", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 344549, "name": "Yingluck Shinawatra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yingluck_Shinawatra?f_ri=344549"}]}, {"id": 6925201, "title": "Barriers toward peace in southern Thailand", "created_at": "2014-04-30T19:55:03.692-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6925201/Barriers_toward_peace_in_southern_Thailand?f_ri=344549", "dom_id": "work_6925201", "summary": "The history of talks with former-separatists since 2004 and recent government attempts at building trust with the local population have yet to achieve any noticeable results in troubled southern Thailand.

paper, Dr. Prajak argues that the failed 2 February 2014 election produced critical and deep implications for the future of Thailand\u2019s political development. The PDRC was the first social movement in Thailand that mobilized mass support against electoral process and institutions. Their animosity towards the election marked an unprecedented development in the country\u2019s prolonged political conflict. The PDRC\u2019s rejection of the election escalated the deep-seated political conflict to another level from which it will be difficult for the country to recover.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38501038, "asset_id": 14996520, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 840326, "first_name": "Southeast Asia Research Centre", "last_name": "CityU", "domain_name": "cityu-hk", "page_name": "searc", "display_name": "Southeast Asia Research Centre CityU", "profile_url": "https://cityu-hk.academia.edu/searc?f_ri=344549", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/840326/295979/350173/s65_southeast_asia.cityu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=344549", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20366, "name": "Elections", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Elections?f_ri=344549", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30936, "name": "Elections and Voting Behavior", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Elections_and_Voting_Behavior?f_ri=344549", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 96933, "name": "Politics in Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_in_Thailand?f_ri=344549", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 107581, "name": "Democratic Breakdown", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democratic_Breakdown?f_ri=344549"}, {"id": 344549, "name": "Yingluck Shinawatra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yingluck_Shinawatra?f_ri=344549"}, {"id": 1886276, "name": "2014 Thai Military Coup", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/2014_Thai_Military_Coup?f_ri=344549"}]}, {"id": 43442942, "title": "Peasants and the redshirt movement in Thailand: some dissenting voices", "created_at": "2020-06-26T07:47:33.618-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43442942/Peasants_and_the_redshirt_movement_in_Thailand_some_dissenting_voices?f_ri=344549", "dom_id": "work_43442942", "summary": "The \u2018redshirt\u2019 movement in Thailand is commonly portrayed in media and scholarly accounts as a class-based, pro-Thaksin social movement that draws fervent support from the poor rural-born masses, especially peasants, in the north and northeast. The movement leaders, including Thaksin, have supposedly won these people\u2019s support by framing urban-based political elites as ammart (aristocrats) who have stakes in suppressing the needs of phrai (serfs) \u2013 a contrasting label for the rural-born poor. I question this analysis that highlights the polarisation of Thai society along class lines. Combining data from election results and fieldwork in Chiang Mai Province \u2013 Thaksin\u2019s birthplace and the putative redshirt heartland \u2013 I show that despite their relative poverty, some peasants remain cynical opponents of the redshirt movement. They have autonomy to penetrate and reinterpret the redshirts\u2019 class-centric collective action frame \u2013 a fact that cautions us against linking rural poverty causally to rural support for redshirts. Peasants are a more diverse, politically divided lot than we are led to believe. \n\nKeywords: Thailand; redshirt movement; framing; rural poverty; social class; peasants; Thaksin Shinawatra; Yingluck
