"work_20519315", "summary": "The retail of alcohol was so central to the economy and society of the Cape of Good Hope during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that it earned the nickname \u201ctavern of two oceans\u201d. This retail business was organised on the so-called\n lease or monopoly ('pacht') system whereby a person paid the authorities for the right to sell a certain type of alcohol for a given period in a specific area. This article traces the intellectual origins of this system of alcohol retail at the Cape during the VOC era. It does so by tracing both the idea of using leases or monopolies, first in the Dutch Republic in the seventeenth century, and by investigating the ways in which various products, including alcohol, were leased off in the largest and most significant of the VOC\u2019s colonies, Batavia, during the first half of the seventeenth century. It is demonstrated that the ways in which alcohol retail and other economic activities were organised at the Cape developed out of practices established elsewhere in the seventeenth-century Dutch world, but that the exact nature of the system was adapted to unique local circumstances at the early Cape. As such, this comparative article serves as an illustration that developments at the Cape in such a central sphere as business practices were the product of both global and local forces and influences.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60621748, "asset_id": 20519315, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8002573, "first_name": "Gerald",

English-language version of the Powerpoint on 'British Naval Power and the Political Situation of Indonesia, 1795-1942: The Netherlands Indies and the Cities of the Archipelago in the Vortex of Global History ' which I presented at the 2nd Annual Forum of the Journal of Maritime Studies and National Integration at the Universitas Diponegoro (UNDIP) in Semarang on 28 October 2020. The article which accompanies this PowerPoint will be published in JMSNI in December 2020. The paper looks at the role played by the Royal Navy in guaranteeing the security of the Netherlands Indies from 31 January-8 February 1795, when the Dutch Stadhouder (Head of State), Willem V (r. 1751-1806), issued  the so-called 'Kew Letters' from his place of exile in London instructing the heads of all Dutch trading posts east of the Cape of Good Hope to hand their possessions over to the British to prevent them falling into French hands, up to 27 February 1942 when the remaining British naval presence in SE Asia was destroyed. This destruction followed the fall of Singapore (15 February 1942),  when the British, along with the American, Australian and Dutch naval assets, were comprehensively defeated in the Battle of the Java Sea by a Japanese fleet under the command of Admiral Takeo Takagi, tasked with protecting General Imamura's 16th Army conquest of Java.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64895853, "asset_id":

isolated, sealed off -- these are all terms that have been used to describe Japan from the time the Portuguese were expelled in 1639 until commercial treaties permitting free trade were concluded in 1856. During this time, the only Westerners permitted into Japan were the dozen or so Dutch East India Company servants, who were crowded onto tiny Deshima Island in the Bay of Nagasaki after 1641. These would not seem to be ideal conditions for cultural influence. But every year Company vessels transported hundreds of objects into Japan that reflected European taste and technological accomplishment.\r\nThis study examines how European material culture moved through the world of Early Modern Japan from port to end-user. Company trade, private trade, smuggling and gift-giving practices are elucidated through the extensive use of the archives of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and its successors, personal archives and Japanese sources. Focused case studies on clocks and clockwork, glass and firearms show the ongoing influence of Europe on Japan, demolishing forever the idea that Japan was culturally isolated.

It was decided that an independent Military Commission should carry out a thorough military investigation of the Dutch overseas possessions. The Prussian-born military engineer Carl Friedrich Reimer became a member of this Commission. He kept a diary of the journey for his superiors in Batavia. An extract of this diary is preserved at the National Archives of The Netherlands. It is a valuable source since it contains not only observations on the primary activities of the Military Commission, but also of many remarkable occurrences during the trip. The manuscript includes reflections on the size and origins of Hindu monuments on Java, remarks on the use of locally cultivated gambir at Riau (Tanjung Pinang), espionage activities during a visit to Madras (Chennai), where the English fortifications were observed and the crops in the botanical garden of EIC-surgeon James Anderson were discussed. Reimer even added his personal thoughts about slavery in the diary, reasoning why, in his opinion, many Javanese were unfit as slaves, describing them as \u00abchildren of nature\u00bb. These subjects had little to do with the main tasks of the Military Commission. Yet, C.F. Reimer gathered all this information for his superiors to judge on its \u00abusefulness\u00bb. Also, there are indications that he may have wanted to publish some of his findings. This paper will highlight some extracts from the diary and discuss the reasons behind this kind of intelligence gathering, the choice of keeping a diary, and the possible reasons why this manuscript, and its content, remained unknown.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56954536, "asset_id": 37005122, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4937936, "first_name": "Jeroen", "last_name": "Bos", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "Bos", "display_name": "Jeroen Bos", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/Bos?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4937936/2132684/16944215/s65_jeroen.bos.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 9588, "name": "Natural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Natural_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30010, "name": "Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Empire?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 61922, "name": "Agency", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agency?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 80633, "name": "Intelligence gathering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intelligence_gathering?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 195722, "name": "Information broker", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_broker?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 801646, "name": "Circulation of Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Circulation_of_Knowledge?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 2986433, "name": "Note keeping", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Note_keeping?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 8855725, "title": "\"The political economy of the Ganga River: highway of state formation in Mughal India, c.1600-1800,\" Leiden University, 2013", "created_at": "2014-10-19T11:00:42.119-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8855725/_The_political_economy_of_the_Ganga_River_highway_of_state_formation_in_Mughal_India_c_1600_1800_Leiden_University_2013?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_8855725", "summary": "This dissertation examines the political economy of the Ganga River during the early modern period. Thematically, the seven chapters of the dissertation may be categorized in three broad divisions. Taking a longue dur\u00e9e perspective, the first two chapters situate the Ganga and its plain in the wider cultural and geographical framework of the Indian subcontinent. While Chapter 1 is concerned with the central role of the Ganga in Indian culture and civilization since the first millennium BC, Chapter 2 discusses early migration and the settlement pattern along the Ganga by paying close attention to the environmental predispositions of the region. The second broad division relates to the Ganga as connecting and feeding the political economy of northern India during the early modern period. The Ganga linked the region with the maritime economy, facilitated navigation, transportation of merchandise and also facilitated political control. Thus, Chapters 3 to 6 examine the political economic processes along the Ganga in eastern India, the integration of the regional commercial economy with the maritime global economy, bullion flows and production processes of such merchandise as saltpeter, opium and textiles. As Bihar offered these commodities, its economy pulled the maritime traders who approached the region through the Ganga highway. The inflows of specie boosted the economy and the agricultural and craft-productions kept pace with the increasing demands in overseas markets. Benefitting from the expanding economy of Bihar, the zamindars (warlords-cum-gentry) asserted their control over the Ganga and chocked the flow of resources to the Mughal imperial coffers and thus paving the way for Mughal decline in the eighteenth century. The third and last thematic division in Chapter 7 focuses on the decline of the Mughal Empire, zamindar-led regional centralization, and the political transition to EIC rule.

Walking and cycling routes along 57 locations. Abstract in Dutch: De Gouden Eeuw in Nederland had een keerzijde in de vorm van slavenhandel en slavernij. Dat gold ook voor Groningen, waar een eigen Kamer van de West-Indische Compagnie werd opgericht met een scheepswerf aan de Noorderhaven. Van daaruit voeren schepen naar de Afrikaanse kusten om tot slaaf gemaakte Afrikanen op te kopen en ze naar de overzijde van de Atlantische Oceaan te verschepen. Vooraanstaande Groningers investeerden in de Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC), de West-Indische Compagnie (WIC) en in plantages in Suriname en op de Antillen. Na het afschaffen van de slavernij werden velen van hen of hun nazaten in Nederland financieel gecompenseerd voor het verlies van hun slaven. Deze lucratieve geschiedenis speelde zich niet alleen af overzee; zij werkte ook door in de stad Groningen en Ommelanden. Sporen van het koloniale verleden en de slavernij die daarmee gepaard ging, zijn nog steeds aanwijsbaar. Het statige Calmershuis in de Oude Boteringestraat behoorde toe aan Thomas van Seeratt, die voorafgaand aan een glansrijke carri\u00e8re als commies-provinciaal in Groningen zijn fortuin vergaarde als slavenhandelaar in dienst van de WIC. Ook buiten de stad, op borgen en in kerken, vinden we sporen van het slavernijverleden. Op de borg Nienoord in Leek bevindt zich een reproductie van het portret van de 17e eeuwse jonkvrouwe Anna van Ewsum in het gezelschap van een zwarte bediende. Deze gids voert u langs zo'n 57 locaties, gelegen langs een wandelroute in de stad en meerdere fietsroutes in de provincie.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 69389378, "asset_id": 51851669, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 404575, "first_name": "Barbara", "last_name": "Henkes", "domain_name": "rug", "page_name": "BarbaraHenkes", "display_name": "Barbara Henkes", "profile_url": "https://rug.academia.edu/BarbaraHenkes?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/404575/15830186/96469723/s65_barbara.henkes.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6283, "name": "History of Slavery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Slavery?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7643, "name": "Abolition of Slavery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Abolition_of_Slavery?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16918, "name": "Dutch West India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_West_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19040, "name": "Caribbean Slavery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caribbean_Slavery?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 35766609, "title": "1.5 \u4ece\u6708\u6e2f\u5230\u5b89\u6d77\uff1a\u6cdb\u6d77\u5bc7\u79e9\u5e8f\u4e0e\u897f\u8377\u51b2\u7a81\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6e2f\u53e3\u8f6c\u79fb \u201cFrom Yuegang to Anhai: Port Transfer in the Context of Pan-Piracy Order and Spanish-Dutch Conflict, 1550-1650,\u201d Global History Review \u5168\u7403\u53f2\u8bc4\u8bba 12 (2017): 86-126", "created_at": "2018-01-26T11:47:43.975-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35766609/1_5_%E4%BB%8E%E6%9C%88%E6%B8%AF%E5%88%B0%E5%AE%89%E6%B5%B7_%E6%B3%9B%E6%B5%B7%E5%AF%87%E7%A7%A9%E5%BA%8F%E4%B8%8E%E8%A5%BF%E8%8D%B7%E5%86%B2%E7%AA%81%E8%83%8C%E6%99%AF%E4%B8%8B%E7%9A%84%E6%B8%AF%E5%8F%A3%E8%BD%AC%E7%A7%BB_From_Yuegang_to_Anhai_Port_Transfer_in_the_Context_of_Pan_Piracy_Order_and_Spanish_Dutch_Conflict_1550_1650_Global_History_Review_%E5%85%A8%E7%90%83%E5%8F%B2%E8%AF%84%E8%AE%BA_12_2017_86_126?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_35766609", "summary": "This paper examines the port transfer process from the 1560s to the 1680s in the context of the regional history of southeast coastal China, southern and northeastern Taiwan, and the northern Philippines. According to the official Chinese, Spanish, and Dutch archives and other non-systematical sources, I reveal that the major trading port on the coast of Fujian shifted from Yuegang to Anhai during those 120 years. I then further argue that the transfer occurred in a pan-piracy order, a system in which economic exchange was dominated by piracy, and was accelerated by the Spanish-Dutch conflict, framing a longue dur\u00e9e (long-term historical structures over events) analysis of the cross-border studies of three research paradigms: history of the Ming-Qing transition and the Southern Ming, history of Sino-Western relations, and Socio-economic studies. From the perspective of longue dur\u00e9e analysis, this port-transfer case shows us mechanisms of historical change under the daily order rather than the immediate causal factors, and how the regional historical study significantly reveals larger structural characteristics.\r\n\r\nKey Words: Pirate; Yuegang; Anhai; Order\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55643758, "asset_id":

Goods from the East focuses on the trade in fine products: how they were made, marketed and distributed between Asia and Europe. This trade was conducted by East India Companies and many private traders, and the first Global Age that resulted deeply affected European consumption and manufacturing. This book provides a full comparative and connective study of Asia's trade with a range of European countries. Its themes relate closely to issues of fine manufacturing and luxury goods in the current age of globalization.

For most of its history at the Cape during this period the DRC was not overly biased against unmarried mothers and their illegitimate children, continuing to baptise such children and never acting against the mothers. This changed in the 1780s when the Church started to deny access to its two sacraments \u2013 baptism and Holy Communion \u2013 to illegitimate children and their parents. Through a detailed exploration of baptismal petitions for illegitimate children and censure cases involving unmarried mothers, this article reveals the growing obsession with regulating the conduct of single women. It is suggested that the origins of this movement lie both in local Cape developments, viz. the socio-economic upheavals caused by the Revolutionary wars, and \u2013 perhaps primarily \u2013 in changing attitudes towards motherhood created by Enlightenment ideas and Pietistic religion. At the Cape this new ideology was disseminated by the DRC minister H.R. van Lier who used existing Reformed dogma about the sacraments to regulate the morals of unmarried mothers.

Nonetheless the church itself artistically and architecturally stood apart from the parish community. It was often the largest and only stone-built building in a village; it was legally distinct being subject to canon law, as well as consecrated for the celebration of religious rites. The buildings associated with the \u2018cure of souls\u2019 were sacred sites or holy places, where humanity interacted with the divine.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the importance of the parish church, these buildings have generally not received the same attention from historians as non-parochial places of worship. This collection of essays redresses this balance and reflects on the parish church across a number of confessions \u2013 Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed and Anti-Trinitarian \u2013 during the early modern period. Rather than providing a series of case studies of individual buildings, each essay looks at the evolution of parish churches in response to religious reform as well as confessional change and upheaval. They examine aspects of their design and construction; furnishings and material culture; liturgy and the use of the parish church. While these essays range widely across Europe, the volume also considers how religious provision and the parish church were translated into a global context with colonial and commercial expansion in the Americas and Asia. This interdisciplinary volume seeks to identify what was distinctive about the parish church for the congregations that gathered in them for worship and for communities across the early modern world.\r\n\r\nContents: \r\nThe early modern parish church: an introduction\r\nAndrew Spicer\r\nPatrician and episcopal rivalry for the Milanese parish church: San Nazaro in Brolo during French and Spanish rule, \r\nPhilippa Woodcock\r\nExploring the features and challenges of the urban parish church in the southern Low Countries.

These psalters were issued in numerous editions, and some were prefaced with a short explanation of the musical scale.

In pursuing this task, I will develop a set of basic questions that historicize and problematize the roles, functions and understandings of the Straits across the centuries, and also tease out historical and historiographical paradigms shaping and underpinning the understanding of the region\u2019s past. In pursuing this programme I will make use of a broad range of sources including chronicles and histories, letters and treaties, navigational instructions and travel literature, as well as (European) cartography of the 16th to 18th centuries. In order to gain deeper appreciation of the multi-faceted roles and understandings of the Singapore Straits across the longue dur\u00e9e, I  not only adduce and evaluate materials of European colonial origin, but importantly also heed special attention to sources of Asian origin in general, and specifically to materials that have originally been written in Arabic, Malay, Chinese and have been made accessible to the wider reading public in various contemporary translations. The modes of enquiry and the insights brought to paper here differ both in terms of scope and objectives from my earlier findings expounded in The Singapore and Melaka Straits published in 2010.",

By a comparison between Candidius\u2019 and Valentyn\u2019s ethnography, I found that the Formosan ethnography in \u2019t verwaerloosde Formosa (1675) is the bridge between Candidius and Valentyn. Valentyn compiled his Formosan ethnography largely from abridging the one of C. E. S. Nevertheless, in the description of Formosan religious practices, Valentyn neglected the account of C. E. S. but relied on Candidius\u2019 sensational report. Valentyn\u2019s editorial selection clearly demonstrated his strong personal opinions and chauvinism. \nKeywords: Fran\u00e7ois Valentyn (1666-1727), Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indien, Textual Criticism, Formosan Ethnography, VOC Knowledge Network\n\nThis document is the English translation of the Author\u2019s Chinese paper published as: \u7c21\u5b8f\u9038\uff0c\u3008\u7d30\u8003\u6cd5\u862d\u65af\u74e6\u2027\u8c93\u862d\u5be6\u53ee\uff08Fran\u00e7ois Valentyn\uff09\u7684\u798f\u723e\u6469\u6c99\u6c11\u65cf\u8a8c\uff1a\u53f2\u6e90\u3001\u50b3\u627f\u3001\u500b\u4eba\u610f\u898b\u3009\uff0c\u300a\u6b77\u53f2\u81fa\u7063\u300b17\u5377\uff0c2019\uff0c\u980165-88\u3002(https://www.academia.edu/39788456/)\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60037654, "asset_id": 39837249, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14875171, "first_name": "Hung-yi", "last_name": "Chien", "domain_name": "ncku", "page_name": "HungyiChien", "display_name": "Hung-yi Chien", "profile_url": "https://ncku.academia.edu/HungyiChien?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14875171/13981103/21168803/s65_hung-yi.chien.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3524, "name": "Historiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historiography?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15658, "name": "History of Taiwan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Taiwan?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 164948, "title": "Dockside Prostitution in South African Ports", "created_at": "2008-11-22T23:54:38.478-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/164948/Dockside_Prostitution_in_South_African_Ports?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_164948", "summary": "Prostitution has been a staple of dockside social life for centuries.

In the traditional historiography, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) was predominantly presented as a multinational corporation and non-state colonial actor. Recent research, however, has significantly challenged this view, stressing instead the imperial aspects of VOC rule. This article aims to break new ground by analysing the vocabularies used in seventeenth-century reasoning about Dutch expansion overseas. Focusing on three critics of the VOC from the 1660s and 1670s, Pieter van Dam, Pieter de la Court, and Pieter van Hoorn, the article shows how voices within and outside of the ranks of the Company tried to make sense of the many-faced VOC as a commercial company that was also, in different ways, a state. In an on-going debate that centred on the issues of colonisation, conquest, free trade, and monopoly, the VOC was characterised as a distinctive political body that operated as an overseas extension of the state (Van Dam), as a competitor of the state (De la Court), or as a state as such (Van Hoorn). Following Philip J. Stern's recent analysis of the English East India Company, the VOC should therefore be considered to be a particular political institution in its own terms, which challenged its critics to think about it as a body politic that was neither corporation nor empire, but rather a Company-State.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36982239, "asset_id": 11439763, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 372548, "first_name": "Arthur", "last_name": "Weststeijn", "domain_name": "unipd", "page_name": "ArthurWeststeijn", "display_name": "Arthur Weststeijn", "profile_url": "https://unipd.academia.edu/ArthurWeststeijn?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/372548/96657/11352072/s65_arthur.weststeijn.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 135, "name": "Intellectual History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intellectual_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12624, "name": "History of Political Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Political_Thought?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26606, "name": "17th Century Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 21956822, "title": "The History of Trincomalee during Portuguese and Dutch rule - Ramerini Marco", "created_at": "2016-02-14T09:56:24.683-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/21956822/The_History_of_Trincomalee_during_Portuguese_and_Dutch_rule_Ramerini_Marco?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_21956822", "summary": "INDEX:\r\n1.0 - The History of Trincomalee during Portuguese and Dutch rule: Introduction\r\n2.0 - Trincomalee: The first contacts with the Portuguese\r\n3.0 - Trincomalee: The arrival of the Danes, the Dutch and the construction of the Portuguese Fort\r\n4.0 - Trincomalee: The Dutch conquest and the abandonment of the Fort\r\n5.0 - Trincomalee: The new Dutch occupation and the reconstruction of the Fort\r\n6.0 - Trincomalee: The French attempt\r\n7.0 - Trincomalee: The consolidation of the Dutch presence\r\n8.0 - Trincomalee: The first British occupation and the definitive Dutch surrender\r\n9.0 - Trincomalee: Bibliography.

pharmacist to the Philippines in 1688, the Bohemian Jesuit Georg Joseph Kamel turned to the local nature to identify resources, which he could use in his practice. Remarkably for a Jesuit of his low rank, Kamel soon entered into communication with European scholars and exchanged knowledge and materials with figures both in the Indies and Europe, namely Willem ten Rhijne (1647\u20131700), a Dutch botanist in Batavia; English surgeons in Madras; and two members of the Royal Society, the apothecary James Petiver (c.1665\u20131718) and the naturalist John Ray (1627\u20131705). Based on an analysis of the letters and consignments involved, this article provides an insight into the construction and operation of long-distance networks of knowledge exchange based on factors other than nationality and spanning geopolitical, social and confessional boundaries. Attention will be drawn to the associations between early modern colonial science and trade and, in particular, the role of local merchants as go-betweens. It will be shown how commercial routes provided the infrastructure for knowledge circulation; how agents who travelled by way of established networks of trade mediated material exchange on a global scale; and how intellectual and social incentives, as well as the etiquette of correspondence played a pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of Kamel's correspondence network. Furthermore, in tracing knowledge exchange restricted to the colonial periphery and highlighting the agency of actors stationed overseas, this article contributes to the recent efforts to think beyond national and imperial narratives and reexamine colonial history from the view of the peripheries.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47565300, "asset_id": 27308805, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33004459, "first_name": "Sebestian", "last_name": "Kroupa", "domain_name": "cambridge", "page_name": "SebestianKroupa", "display_name": "Sebestian Kroupa", "profile_url": "https://cambridge.academia.edu/SebestianKroupa?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33004459/9808242/14772781/s65_sebestian.kroupa.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2273, "name": "History of Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Medicine?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2988, "name": "History of Natural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Natural_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6541, "name": "World History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7398, "name": "Jesuit history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jesuit_history?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 21712, "name": "Early Modern Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Science?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 46263, "name": "Spanish empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spanish_empire?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 58559, "name": "East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 675077, "name": "Circulation of Knowledge in the Early Modern Period", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Circulation_of_Knowledge_in_the_Early_Modern_Period?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 41347963, "title": "Empire of Riches: Visions of Dutch Commercial Imperialism, c. 1600-1750", "created_at": "2019-12-18T05:38:36.776-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41347963/Empire_of_Riches_Visions_of_Dutch_Commercial_Imperialism_c_1600_1750?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_41347963", "summary": "This article uncovers the intellectual roots of the exceptionalist narrative of the Dutch empire as a trading empire.

The dominance of this representation of empire in terms of a corporate instead of a national entity explains why the concept of a \u2018Dutch empire\u2019 never became an ideological construct.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61550176, "asset_id": 41347963, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 372548, "first_name": "Arthur", "last_name": "Weststeijn", "domain_name": "unipd", "page_name": "ArthurWeststeijn", "display_name": "Arthur Weststeijn", "profile_url": "https://unipd.academia.edu/ArthurWeststeijn?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/372548/96657/11352072/s65_arthur.weststeijn.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 135, "name": "Intellectual History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intellectual_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3027, "name": "Renaissance Humanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Renaissance_Humanism?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9690, "name": "Intellectual History of Enlightenment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intellectual_History_of_Enlightenment?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 26606, "name": "17th Century Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 30010, "name": "Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Empire?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 41769637, "title": "Repackaging East Indies Natural History in Fran\u00e7ois Valentyn\u2019s Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indi\u00ebn", "created_at": "2020-01-29T01:33:18.519-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41769637/Repackaging_East_Indies_Natural_History_in_Fran%C3%A7ois_Valentyn_s_Oud_en_Nieuw_Oost_Indi%C3%ABn?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_41769637", "summary": "More than five hundred folio pages of Fran\u00e7ois Valentyn\u2019s multivolume description of the trading empire of the Dutch East India Company, Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indi\u00ebn (Old and New East Indies, 1724-1726, five thousand pages in toto), are devoted to the natural history of Amboina.

The figure was probably based on an earlier drawing that is now known as Man in Korean costume (J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles) (fig. 3). The drawing has been related to Siamese ambassadors in London, pagan priests in Goa, and European missionaries in China, but the association with Korea has been most persistent since it was first put forward in 1934: the sitter may have been a freed Korean slave who traveled from Japan to Rome, where Rubens could have met and portrayed him.  The drawing\u2019s degree of detail suggests that at least the dress was done from observation. When the Getty Museum devoted an exhibition to the work in 2013, its experts concluded that the costume may have been authentically East Asian. They also called Rubens\u2019s rendition an \u2018imaginative\u2019 interpretation that \u2018defies categorization\u2019: he did not face a Korean man.  \nThe following will put forward another view, namely that Rubens\u2019s drawing was based on an earlier work by another artist. This was a portrait of an individual: a Chinese merchant who traveled on a ship of the Dutch East India Company \u2013 in fact the first Chinese to visit Europe whose identity is documented in such detail. The new conclusion is based on an entry in an album amicorum of the Dutchman Nicolaas de Vrise, dated 1595-1609 (fig. 4, 5).  One of this album\u2019s contributions, of 12 January 1601, is a colored drawing similar to Rubens\u2019s.

Peshwa, Gaikwad, Kolhapur, Sawantwadi. An intense fight between the two sides ensued; which caused the ship Wimmenum to explode alongwith the other ships. Most of the shipmates were taken prisoners by the Marathas, although a few escaped and made their way to Batavia and The Netherlands. The story of the battle appeared in the contemporary Dutch Newspapers multiple times, and was also reported in the English and French print media in the form of Newspapers and Books. The magnitude of the loss forced the authorities at Batavia to drastically change the shipping routes for VOC ships going more southerly than Cochin. Interestingly, after more than 250 years from the battle, the apparent wreckage of the ship Wimmenum was located in 2015 on the sea floor near Anthuchengu, Kerala by the local fishermen. The discoveries were mentioned in a Malayalam book as well. This battle, while being extremely important from a lot of angles, has largely escaped the attention of scholars of Maratha History as well maritime History of India. The paper tries to bridge this gap.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56413564, "asset_id": 36494035, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 941041,

East India Companies of the early modern period in the history of capitalist system. On the one hand, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they were in the forefront of capitalist development in terms of business organization, capital accumulation, strengthening of state financial systems of their countries and even encouragement of home production. On the other hand, by the late eighteenth century East India Companies were more and more hindering further capitalist development. This manifested itself especially strikingly in the case of the British Company which due to the nature of its trade could not fit into the epoch of industrial capital.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52646576, "asset_id": 32457310, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 61316794, "first_name": "Kirill", "last_name": "Fursov", "domain_name": "moscowstate", "page_name": "Kirill_Fursov", "display_name": "Kirill Fursov", "profile_url": "https://moscowstate.academia.edu/Kirill_Fursov?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/61316794/15940801/98760509/s65_kirill.fursov.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7531, "name": "History of Capitalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Capitalism?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 58559, "name": "East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 323875, "name": "British East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1221356, "name": "French East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 15765778, "title": "Literary Inscriptions on the South Africa Beach: Ambiguous Settings, Ambivalent Textualities", "created_at": "2015-09-16T08:42:35.691-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15765778/Literary_Inscriptions_on_the_South_Africa_Beach_Ambiguous_Settings_Ambivalent_Textualities?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_15765778", "summary": "South Africa boasts an extensive coastline that stretches over 2,800 kilometres and is alternately caressed and pounded by two oceans, which have produced a chain of golden sandy beaches along its shores. Yet compared to other sites, the beach does not feature very prominently in South African literary culture and is even less visible in literary criticism. The farm, the bushveld and the arid karoo; city, town and village: all have accrued layers of inscription while the beach sits almost silent at the edge of the South African literary and critical imagination. Its relative muteness is at least in part dictated by the lack of space accorded to levity and the ludic in South African letters, burdened as they have been with seeking to bear the weight of the experiences of colonial dispossession and apartheid oppression and of representing struggle and strife.

With Sri Lanka\u2019s significant seafaring history, and the archaeological riches of its land sites, there can be no doubt that study of the underwater sites will reveal a fascinating history.\nUnderwater surveys carried out in Galle Harbour since 1992 have revealed 26 archaeological sites dating from the 13th century, through the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century, to modern times. This history is also reflected in the material remains found on the harbour and artefacts excavated date from the 13th century to 21st century. Several stone anchors of Indo-Arabian pattern have been discovered, including one from the Arabian Peninsula weighing almost a tonne, and an anchor of Mediterranean pattern (Souter, 1998). A celadon bowl of the Southern Song dynasty (13th century) is one of the few relics of early trade with China; while the later 17th century blue-and-white Chinese trade ware is abundant. While Sri Lankan archaeology is rich in cultural treasures from much earlier periods, it is the combination of several United Dutch East India Company (Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, or VOC) wrecks and the VOC\u2019s extensive historical archives that make Galle Harbour so interesting. This combination of archaeological and historical resources provides a unique opportunity to explore Sri Lanka\u2019s role in international trade, and to examine the political and cultural affects of this trade.\nIn 2001 a Maritime Archaeology Unit (MAU) was formed under the Mutual Heritage Centre and managed by the Central Cultural Fund, a Sri Lankan Government agency. The MAU\u2019s first major project was the excavation of the Avondster, one of five Dutch East Indiamen wrecked\n\nThe Avondster Project had a number of aims in addition to the survey, excavation and conservation of the site and artefacts. One of the primary goals was to build the capacity of the MAU\u2019s Sri Lankan archaeologists and conservators, and associated infrastructure for the continuation of a permanent maritime archaeology program in Sri Lanka. Another important goal was the development of a maritime museum, to showcase Sri Lanka\u2019s broad maritime history, its sites and the people involved; with the initial displays based on the material recovered and research undertaken during the Avondster Project.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61090441, "asset_id": 40806732, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4958596, "first_name": "Robert", "last_name": "Parthesius", "domain_name": "nyuad", "page_name": "RobertParthesius", "display_name": "Robert Parthesius", "profile_url": "https://nyuad.academia.edu/RobertParthesius?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4958596/2145019/21273747/s65_robert.parthesius.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3470, "name": "Community Engagement & Participation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Engagement_and_Participation?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5459, "name": "Cultural Heritage Conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage_Conservation?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 6888, "name": "Indian Ocean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 9850, "name": "Sri Lanka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lanka?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 19405, "name": "Cultural Heritage Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage_Management?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 20159, "name": "Capacity Building", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Capacity_Building?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 25275, "name": "Indian Ocean World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_World?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 30707, "name": "Indian Ocean Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_Trade?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 49917, "name": "Dutch History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 55872, "name": "Science for Conservation and Restoration of Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_for_Conservation_and_Restoration_of_Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65544, "name": "Indian Ocean Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_Archaeology?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 93997, "name": "Scientific Diving", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Scientific_Diving?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 218722, "name": "Dutch overseas history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_overseas_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 675052, "name": "UNESCO world heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/UNESCO_world_heritage?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 773911, "title": "\u2018Records in a Rival\u2019s Repository.

This seemingly mundane event on the Western Australian coast earned Hartog a, then unforeseen, prominence in the legacy of seafaring history and in the early European history of Australia. It established him as a notable figure in the Age of Exploration. Today, the historical events and the physical remains of Hartog\u2019s landing in Western Australia are firmly embedded within the context of European activity in the Indian Ocean region and, more specifically, Dutch exploration of the Australian coastline in the 17th century.

"summary": "The establishment of a settlement at the Cape of Good Hope in the seventeenth century and an expansion of the sphere of colonial influence in the eighteenth century made South Africa the only part of sub-Saharan Africa where Europeans could travel with relative ease deep into the interior. As a result individuals with scientific interests in Africa came to the Cape. This book examines writings and drawings of scientifically educated travellers, particularly in the field of ethnography, against the background of commercial and administrative discourses on the Cape. It is argued that the scientific travellers benefited more from their relationship with the colonial order than the other way around.\r\n\r\nReviews: British Journal for the History of Science (Saul Dubow, History Dept., University of Sussex), Internationale Neerlandistiek (Samira Sassi, Dutch Dept., University of Oldenburg), Isis (Alette Fleischer, Department of History of Science & Technology, University of Twente), Centaurus: Journal for the European Society for the History of Science (James E.

In the mid-17th century, Chinese junk traders under Zheng Chenggong's (\u912d\u6210\u529f) protection ran this business from Amoy. After the 1650s, the commercial strife between the Zheng clan and the VOC threw a spanner in the works that eventually resulted in a war in 1661. In 1669, the Batavian authorities gradually relaxed their control over the Chinese junk trade on the Nagasaki-Batavia route. The antagonism between the Zheng regime in Taiwan and the VOC in Batavia, compounded by that between the Zheng and the Qing court on the Chinese mainland and the disputes between China and Japan, created a loophole for the Batavian Chinese to run the business on the Nagasaki-Batavia route in 1665-1719. This article has consulted published and unpublished archival sources to clarify the rise and fall of the business of the Batavian Chinese on this route and also the duration of this voyage, the numbers of the crews, and the carried cargoes. The author has discovered that the blind eye turned by the Batavian authorities was crucial, and this trade contributed to the expansion of the plantations owned by Batavian Chinese officers. Their experience in exploiting the leeway granted by different states was the legacy that led to the success of the later junk traders on China Seas in the 18th century.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58009216, "asset_id": 37990561, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2644935, "first_name": "Weichung", "last_name": "Cheng", "domain_name": "sinica", "page_name": "httpwwwithsinicaedutwmembers_02_lookphpno473page1", "display_name": "Weichung Cheng", "profile_url": "https://sinica.academia.edu/httpwwwithsinicaedutwmembers_02_lookphpno473page1?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2644935/842543/6972408/s65_skipio.formosanus.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1727, "name": "Early Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43434, "name": "Overseas Chinese", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Overseas_Chinese?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53936, "name": "History of Food", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Food?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 166284, "name": "Batavia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Batavia?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 301233, "name": "Nagasaki", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nagasaki?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 683458, "name": "Noodles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Noodles?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 994585, "name": "Xiamen", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Xiamen?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1149305, "name": "Sailing Routes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sailing_Routes?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1164935, "name": "Canton Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canton_Trade?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 12507737, "title": "Die verlorengegangenen Schiffe der Niederl\u00e4ndischen Ostindienkompanie (VOC) ", "created_at": "2015-05-21T06:01:59.974-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12507737/Die_verlorengegangenen_Schiffe_der_Niederl%C3%A4ndischen_Ostindienkompanie_VOC_?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_12507737", "summary": "This work overviews complete lists and cartographic as well as statistical analysis of the lost ships of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) during 17th and 18th century.

Gradually the Europeans' positive impressions faded away and Japanese were seen as yellow-skinned and relatively inferior. Accounting for this dramatic transformation, From White to Yellow is a pioneering study of the evolution of European interpretations of the Japanese and the emergence of discourses about race in early modern Europe. Transcending the conventional focus on Africans and Jews within the rise of modern racism, Rotem Kowner demonstrates that the invention of race did not emerge in a vacuum in eighteenth-century Europe, but rather was a direct product of earlier discourses of the \"Other.\" This compelling study indicates that the racial discourse on the Japanese, alongside the Chinese, played a major role in the rise of the modern concept of race. While challenging Europe's self-possession and sense of centrality, the discourse delayed the eventual consolidation of a hierarchical worldview in which Europeans stood immutably at the apex. Drawing from a vast array of primary sources, From White to Yellow traces the racial roots of the modern clash between Japan and the West.\n\n\nENDORSEMENTS\n\u201cThis magisterial work by Rotem Kowner fills an important gap in contemporary scholarship about racial history and European perceptions of the Japanese during the age of maritime explorations, beginning with the voyages of Marco Polo. The author approaches a delicate and complex topic with a breadth of knowledge and erudition based on the careful analysis of primary documents from a wide variety of both printed and manuscript sources in numerous languages.\u201d \nM. Antoni J. Ucerler, S.J. Director of the Ricci Institute, University of San Francisco\n\n\u201cRotem Kowner has written an extraordinary book which will be must-reading for anyone interested in Western perceptions of the Japanese from the beginning (Marco Polo\u2019s account) to the 18th century, and to anyone interested in the history of the very concept of \u2018race.\u2019\" \nGary Leupp, Department of History, Tufts University\n\n\u201cErudite, comprehensive, and clearly-written, From White to Yellow offers the reader a panorama of the Euro-Japanese encounter in the pre-modern period that is unsurpassed in previous scholarship.\u201d \nRonnie Hsia, Department of History, Pennsylvania State University \n\n\nREVIEWS\n\u201cThis is a path-breaking book, rich in insights and extraordinary well researched. ... This is a dense book, exhaustive in its treatment of European writings on Japan and duly aware of the need to keep in mind how Europeans wrote about Others. There are fascinating explorations of topics such as slavery, miscegenation, and George Psalmanazar, the self-styled Japanese. \u2026 [T]he text of this volume covers only slightly more than half of the pages and most of the rest is taken up by endnotes, many of them as long as a paragraph and some filling half a page, together with a huge bibliography covering works in twelve languages. Not only do the notes testify to the prodigious labor that has gone into this book, but they also show how meticulously Kowner has explored the ramifications and details of encounters between Europeans and the various Others they encountered. \u2026 This book is, though, unsurpassed in its careful examination of European writings on Japan, and the efficient index makes Kowner\u2019s analyses and coverage of the literature easily accessible\u201d\n\tPeter Kornicki, Journal of World History 27 (2016): 347\u2013350\n\n\u201cFrom White to Yellow is a big book in every way. The product of immense research, it is an exceptionally ambitious work that makes a string of innovative and far-reaching arguments. Even more strikingly, it is simply the first of a planned two-volume series that, once completed, will span over six hundred years of European interactions with Japan. ... The scale of the task and the depth of the research invite a comparison to Donald Lach\u2019s Asia in the Making of Europe, a groundbreaking series that can best be described as an almost supernatural feat of scholarship. \u2026 Overall the work is a significant achievement that should be read by anyone working in the field. It moves Japan from the margins to the very center of discussions over the development of early modern racial discourse, making a powerful case for the importance of the European encounter with Japan. Japan represented a problem for Europeans, and Kowner brilliantly dissects the varied ways in which they struggled to deal with it in the early modern period.\u201d\n\tAdam Clulow, Monumenta Nipponica 71 (2016): 140\u2013143\n\n\u201cThe book is a remarkable scholarly achievement and in some ways almost too detailed in its exposition. It throws valuable light on evolving European attitudes to race and to racial hierarchies and demonstrates how they were filtered through different social mechanisms \u2013 religion, trade, power \u2013 and how despite empirical evidence, few Europeans could actually \u2018see\u2019 racial differences in the case of the Japanese, even depicting their clothing in a quasi-European style in paintings and engravings. \u2026 Kowner\u2019s book is the outcome of years of scholarly investigation in many languages including Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, Latin, Spanish, German, English and yet others and is exhaustively documented with fully half of its almost 700 pages being devoted to sources, notes and bibliography. Its essential theme is the tracing of the transformation and images that slowly moved the Japanese from being seen as \u2018white race\u2019 to re-classification as a \u2018yellow\u2019 one, along it may be said with the Chinese and the Koreans, whose racial history in relation to the West is inevitably part of the larger story of the transformation of perceptions as they applied to East Asia as a whole, and the light that this sheds on the roots of racial and racialist thought in the West. \u2026.\u201d\n\tJohn Clammer, Ethnic and Racial Studies 39 (2016): 1500\u20131502\n\n\u201cIn this erudite, complex, and ambitious work, Rotem Kowner examines how Europeans came to see the Japanese nation as \u201cyellow\u201d and inferior, after initially perceiving them as \u201cwhite\u201d equals. ... Kowner\u2019s work complicates the history of the construction and development of the idea of race by examining the European encounter with the Japanese, whom Europeans initially found different but not culturally or materially inferior  ... A short review cannot do justice to Kowner\u2019s rich, multilayered work. The concluding chapter offers a prologue for the forthcoming second volume, which will examine how the Japanese were relegated to inferiority in the eighteenth century, and how a virulently racial discourse ensued.\u201d\n\tRobert Entenmann, Journal of Jesuit Studies (2016): 132\u2013134.\n\n\"It is an unsurpassable analysis redolent of superb scholarship. In the end, Kowner makes a strong case that, from 1300 to 1735, Europeans slowly arrived at a system that enabled them to present a universal hierarchical taxonomy of humankind--based on rudimentary notions of race--with themselves at its apex. ... From White to Yellow does help us to understand ''the mechanisms that govern[ed] the rise and evolution of the concept of race in early modern times.'' In doing so, it richly expands our perspective on the origins of race and racism.\" Nam-lin Hur, University of Toronto Quarterly 85:3 (2016): 533-534.\n\n\u201cKowner\u2019s work is unique in that, unlike the majority of studies that focus on race in East Asia, it aims to elucidate the emergence of these distinctions at a much earlier point in Euro-Japanese relations\u2014in fact, from their origin, if such can be found. \u2026 Focusing on the five centuries between Marco Polo\u2019s first report of a mysterious island called Cipangu and Linnaeus\u2019s categorization of the Japanese as a \u201cyellow\u201d race in 1735, Kowner builds a compelling argument that traces the development of racism from Europeans\u2019 earliest imaginings of the Japanese people to the heart of Enlightenment thought. ... From Yellow to White is also notable for the breadth of its source materials, which, despite spanning several languages and centuries, are housed within a sound and well-organized theoretical framework; I can think of many other works that attempt to do the same but lack the clarity found here. The discussion of Japanese slavery, which tends to be a less-discussed topic in Japanese historiography, as well as of the cultural similarities between Japanese and their European observers, receive remarkably nuanced treatments as points of comparison between Japan and other countries within Europe\u2019s purview. This work is therefore both timely and adds something new to the contemporary debate on the birth of race in Western thought.\u201d\n\tChristina Ghanbarpour, Itinerario 40 (2016):

He was documented as the first Chinese artist exhibited in the Royal Academy of the Arts\u2019 annual exhibition, and he was the one who has created works with a sculptural nature in combining the styles of Chinese and foreign cultures. It was the time when the domestic life in Britain of the eighteenth century was largely enriched because of tea\u2019s consumption. Accompanied with luxury Chinese porcelain wares and its artistic accessories such as Chinese wallpaper, furniture and figurines that were brought back by the British East Indian Company in the seventeenth century, the \u2018Chinese taste\u2019 gradually reached its peak in the eighteenth century. Therefore, Chitqua\u2019s portraiture business in eighteenth century London is an unusual case to the portraiture market at that time. Were Chitqua\u2019s Chinese-styled clay figures accepted by the art cycle of London? How did he integrate himself into the European-based portraiture market? Chitqua\u2019s extraordinary experience remains largely unknown. Hence, in this paper, we manage to sketch out Chitqua\u2019s successful achievement as \u2018the celebrated artist\u2019 in his London period, as well as his early time in Canton and his later return to Canton. His impact as an artist in London, and his role as a cultural bridge between Britain and China and as a representative traveller that adapted to the first globalised and trans-cultural acculturation of art will be questioned and examined by the existing accounts and a few of his traceable portrait figures during his London period.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58988211, "asset_id": 38890154, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6727042, "first_name": "Yi-Chieh", "last_name": "Shih", "domain_name": "leidenuniv", "page_name": "YichiehShih", "display_name": "Yi-Chieh M .

The extensive paper archive of the VOC recorded slaves in ways which matched the concerns of the administration, such as enumeration in census returns and as objects for inheritance or sale in estate inventories. Nonetheless, historians have been able to uncover considerably more information about their experience and agency. Much detail is provided in criminal and (to a lesser extent) civil judicial records, which explains the emphasis on individual and collective resistance in the slave historiography of the 1980s. More recently Cape historians have adapted techniques of reading across the grain in order to explore the mentalit\u00e9 and cultural worlds of Cape slaves. However, the VOC archive was not only a record of the ruling classes. Slaves also used writing for their own purposes, either in alternative networks of literacy in Asian languages or by turning Dutch papers into documents for their own advantage, some of which has found its way into the official documents. The combination of these records with oral traditions and community memories have enabled Cape historians to transcend the apparent silence of the official archive.

Surprisingly, this literature so far has not produced any study of the relations between the Dutch and Marathas. The equally large & rich Historiography of Maratha History also happens to be largely silent about the same. Given the importance of both the VOC and the Marathas in early modern India, such a study would indeed fill up a great number of gaps in the Historians' understanding of both VOC & Marathas. In this paper, a survey of the relations between VOC and Shivaji is presented, thus making a small but important advance over the work done till date. The recently discovered direct correspondence between the two in the Nationaalarchief at The Hague has been used for the very first time here. And also the importance of Dutch records for studying the life of Shivaji is outlined.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54776426, "asset_id": 34915112, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 941041, "first_name": "Nikhil", "last_name": "Bellarykar", "domain_name": "independentresearcher", "page_name": "NikhilBellarykar", "display_name": "Nikhil Bellarykar", "profile_url": "https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/NikhilBellarykar?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/941041/13858614/14939008/s65_nikhil.bellarykar.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 101456, "name": "Maratha History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maratha_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 539651, "name": "Marathas, Shivaji Maharaj", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marathas_Shivaji_Maharaj?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 955632, "name": "Shivaji", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shivaji?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 31524948, "title": "A Comparison of Dutch and English East India Companies", "created_at": "2017-02-19T23:16:33.656-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31524948/A_Comparison_of_Dutch_and_English_East_India_Companies?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_31524948", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51867868, "asset_id": 31524948, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1134518, "first_name": "Adem", "last_name": "G\u00fcnayd\u0131n", "domain_name": "bilkent", "page_name": "AdemG\u00fcnayd\u0131n", "display_name": "Adem  G\u00fcnayd\u0131n", "profile_url": "https://bilkent.academia.edu/AdemG%C3%BCnayd%C4%B1n?f_ri=65822", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 131, "name": "European History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/European_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24291, "name": "History of Indian subcontinet and Central Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Indian_subcontinet_and_Central_Asia?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 58559, "name": "East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 29456189, "title": "Menjiplak Kompeni VOC", "created_at": "2016-10-26T23:03:32.625-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29456189/Menjiplak_Kompeni_VOC?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_29456189", "summary": "VOC adalah perusahaan multinasional pertama dan terbesar dalam 5 abad terakhir sistem kapitalisme global.

The debate fjared up again fifty years later when Nicolaes Witsen and Gijsbert Cuper confronted the Republic of Letters with a rare bronze mirror from Han Dynasty China.

These translations are aimed at a contemporary English-speaking Asian readership interested in the early modern history of European trade, warfare and expansion in Southeast Asia with a focus on Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. Researchers specialising in early European colonialism, international law, international relations, security studies, and diplomatic history will also find that the documents translated in this volume offer new and unfamiliar perspectives. Materlieff\u2019s business acumen, military and diplomataic prowess as well as his vision of empire all have implications for examining not only European expansion into Southeast Asia, but also into other regions at large, including especially south Asia, Africa and the Americas.\r\nAdmiral Matelieff was a director of the Rotterdam Chamber of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) formed in 1602. He was appointed fleet commander on one of the company\u2019s first voyages to Asia. Matelieff\u2019s mission was both commercial and military: he launched a major sea-borne attack on the Portuguese colony of Melaka, arranged for the signing of treaties with the rulers of Johor, Aceh and Ternate, and founded the first Dutch fort on the island of Ternate. His endeavours, however, to open the Chinese market for the Dutch company proved unsuccessful. \r\n\tFollowing his return to the Dutch Republic in September 1608, Matelieff penned a series of memorials and letters. In these he advanced recommendations for changing the way the company organized its fleets and conducted business. More importantly he offered  his Dutch contemporaries a vision of empire in Asia. The materials contained in this volume offer important observations of a perceptive analyst who was also determined to grasp the political and economic structures of Asia, and also of inter-state relations in across this vast region. At a time of Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Danish, French and English engagement in Southeast Asia, Matelieff sought to critically assess and strategize on the ways in which Europeans were increasingly engaging with Asian polities and their rulers.\r\n\r\nThis book will be released for sale in Australasia and Europe in June 2014 and available in the Americas after September 2014\r\n\"\"\"\"",

This\nvisit is surrounded with mysteries. The Dutch hoped and expected to obtain better\ntrade privileges for their help in subduing the Ming loyalist and pirate Koxinga in the\nprevious years, and even though they were already informed before their departure\nfrom Fuzhou to Beijing that their request was denied, they embarked on their journey\nanyway, only to be denied again in the end. Why did the Manchu rulers and Chinese\nofficials allow the journey to continue and did they receive the Dutch in Beijing? Why\nwould the Kangxi Emperor commission the painting? What does the painting say, if\nanything, about Kangxi\u2019s attitude toward the Dutch? Would a tribute painting of the\nDutch presenting horses not mean that Kangxi considered the Dutch a tribute state?\nWhy then did the Kangxi court deny the Dutch better trade privileges? Modern studies\nhave thus far glossed over or have failed to answer these questions satisfyingly. This\nstudy uses the painting as a starting point and the horses as a leitmotiv to investigate,\nfirstly, the painting and its imperial commission; secondly, the disproportionate\nattention on the Chinese and Manchu side to the horses during the journey and\neventually during the court audience in Beijing and even long after that; thirdly, the\npossible motives behind Kangxi\u2019s passion for horses and his commissioning of the\npainting, by presenting an art historical study of tribute horse paintings; and fourthly\nand lastly, the possible reasons for the denial of the trade privileges to the Dutch. The\nstudy argues that the Kangxi Emperor ordered the dispatch of another Dutch embassy\nseemingly for the sole purpose of obtaining the horses. In the eyes of the Chinese, the\nhorses represent Heavenly Horses with a tradition dating back to the Han dynasty,\nwhich as tribute and as paintings thereof have become symbols of imperial legitimation\nand divine sanction. The denial of the trade privileges, however, was probably\nstrategically motivated to ensure Manchu control over the southern sea border.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66184225, "asset_id": 45680807, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 189687121, "first_name": "Lennert", "last_name": "Gesterkamp", "domain_name": "uni-erlangen", "page_name": "LennertGesterkamp", "display_name": "Lennert Gesterkamp", "profile_url": "https://uni-erlangen.academia.edu/LennertGesterkamp?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/189687121/52914408/41032949/s65_lennert.gesterkamp.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2399, "name": "Daoism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Daoism?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2839, "name": "Sinology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sinology?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8228, "name": "Chinese Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Art?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26606, "name": "17th Century Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26850, "name": "Chinese history (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_history_History_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 49917, "name": "Dutch History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65625, "name": "Chinese painting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_painting?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 209188, "name": "Chinese art history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_art_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 218722, "name": "Dutch overseas history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_overseas_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 665361, "name": "Daoist studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Daoist_studies?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 8170165, "title": "The Heirs of Vijayanagara.

Building on a unique combination of unexplored Indian texts and Dutch archival (VOC) records, this research offers a captivating new analysis of political culture, power relations, and dynastic developments -- with chapters devoted to foundations myths, successions to the throne, the power of courtiers, court protocol and diplomatic insults, influences from Sultanate courts, and mutual relations.\r\n\r\nIn great detail, this monograph provides both new facts and fresh insights that contest existing scholarship. By highlighting their competitive, fluid, and dynamic nature, it undermines the historiography viewing these courts as harmonic, hierarchic, and static. Far from being remote, ritualised figures, we find kings and Brahmins contesting with other courtiers for power. At the same time, by stressing continuities with the past, this study questions recent scholarship that perceives a fundamentally new form of Nayaka kingship. Thus, this research has important repercussions for the way we perceive both these kingdoms and their \u2018medieval\u2019 precursors.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80991423, "asset_id": 8170165, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 197010, "first_name": "Lennart", "last_name": "Bes", "domain_name": "leidenuniv", "page_name": "LennartBes", "display_name": "Lennart Bes", "profile_url": "https://leidenuniv.academia.edu/LennartBes?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/197010/210675/3104090/s65_lennart.bes.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3024, "name": "History of India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_India?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15054, "name": "Early modern cross-cultural encounters", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_modern_cross-cultural_encounters?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20771, "name": "South India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_India?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25172, "name": "Courts and Elites (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Courts_and_Elites_History_?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 31733, "name": "Court Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Court_Culture?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 35653, "name": "South India  (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_India_History_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 51029, "name": "Medieval Indian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_Indian_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 98518, "name": "Madurai", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Madurai?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 148858, "name": "Karnataka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Karnataka?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 163005, "name": "Early modern diplomacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_modern_diplomacy?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 218722, "name": "Dutch overseas history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_overseas_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 241884, "name": "Dynastic Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dynastic_Politics?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 257634, "name": "Tanjavur Marathi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tanjavur_Marathi?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 274526, "name": "Dynastic legitimation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dynastic_legitimation?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 330062, "name": "Vijayanagara", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vijayanagara?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 518466, "name": "Ramnad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ramnad?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 685369, "name": "Keladi-Ikkeri Nayakas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Keladi-Ikkeri_Nayakas?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 816869, "name": "Vijayanagara-Nayaka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vijayanagara-Nayaka?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1349393, "name": "Ikkeri Nayakas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ikkeri_Nayakas?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1429424, "name": "Early Modern South India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_South_India?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 16460684, "title": "The Internment of Germans in Dutch East India and the Japanese Sinking of the Van Imhoff", "created_at": "2015-10-04T18:51:44.524-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/16460684/The_Internment_of_Germans_in_Dutch_East_India_and_the_Japanese_Sinking_of_the_Van_Imhoff?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_16460684", "summary": "Germans have been involved with the Dutch colonial and trading activities in Southeast Asia for centuries. Even the well-known medical doctors and Japan-scholars Caspar Schamberger (1623-1706), Engelbert Kaempfer (1651-1716) and Philipp Franz von Siebold (1796-1866), actually worked for the \u201cVereenigde Oostindische Compagnie\u201d (VOC), better known as Dutch East India Company at its famous trading post Deshima in Nagasaki harbor, thus creating some triangle relationship between Germany, the Netherlands, and Japan. \nIn this paper I want to briefly introduce the post-WWI activities of Germans in Dutch East India itself, focusing on their working experiences as well as on the outpost of the Tokyo-based German East Asiatic Society in Batavia (1934-40). The main part of the paper will deal with the internment of all Germans in the Dutch colony after the occupation of the Netherlands by the Third Reich in late spring 1940. While women and children were subsequently allowed to leave the colony either for Shanghai or Japan, German men remained in camps until they were transferred to Ceylon in early 1942. As this was a few months after the Pearl Harbor attacks, one of the three transport ships, the Van Imhoff, was actually sunk during this transfer by a Japanese plane, killing about 480 Germans onboard. Most likely, this was the highest number of German casualties in the Pacific theatre of war at one stroke, ironically killed by the Third Reich\u2019s axis partner Japan. After WWII, it became clear that the Dutch crew of the Van Imhoff saved itself without providing any support to the Germans in their custody, causing some uproar in the mid-1960s when the case was discussed in West-German media. The aim of this paper is to remind the audience of the cooperation of Germans with Dutch colonialism and the fact that Japan was more than once the third party involved, by providing the working space for some German VOC-employees from the 17th to the 19th century, by accepting hundreds of German refugees from the Dutch colony in 1941 and by tragically killing 480 Germany on a Dutch transport ship in February 1942.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39003812, "asset_id": 16460684, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 112093, "first_name": "Christian W.", "last_name": "Spang", "domain_name": "daito", "page_name": "ChristianWSpang", "display_name": "Christian W.

Powerful kingdoms and cities have arisen and a typical trait has been immigration and strong influences from far and near, contributing to a multicultural identity. In the late 14th century or early 15th century the city and the kingdom of Melaka was founded. The small fishing village rapidly grew to a large port and emporium, overshadowing the older ports in the area. The wealth of Melaka soon drew attention from the Portuguese, followed by Dutch and British, largely driven by capitalism. The colonial period of Melaka lasted from early 16th to mid-20th century, almost encompassing the entire era of the European colonialism (early 15th to mid-20th century). The city has witnessed the changing fate of various European powers, whose legacies have been intricately woven into its urban form. The layering process of vernacular, Hindu, Buddhist, Chinese and Islamic cultures and its materialization had been going on peacefully since the creation of these cosmopolitan settlement and communities in Melaka. The cosmopolitan culture has been formed through complex layering processes of various cultures, ideologies, economies, and ecosystems sustained over a long extended historical period and clearly manifested in the complexity and hybridity of the production of its settlements\u2019 morphology and architectural typologies. Like other Southeast Asian cities, Melaka\u2019s cultural and geographical boundaries are always blurring, overlapping, or intersecting, and cannot clearly be defined. People in different places, islands or continents have kept moving, communicating, and intermingling from past till present, influencing each other and producing hybrid, fused, diverse architecture and material culture. Therefore the urban morphology of Melaka has to be understood since the inception of the city, through the perspectives of the cosmopolitan communities, the colonial powers as well as the Malaysian government post-independence.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47381828, "asset_id": 24325333, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37612749, "first_name": "Wen Hao", "last_name": "Lee", "domain_name": "uq", "page_name": "WenHaoLee", "display_name": "Wen Hao Lee", "profile_url": "https://uq.academia.edu/WenHaoLee?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/37612749/12278269/14493375/s65_wen_hao.lee.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7628, "name": "Urban Morphology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Morphology?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 12179, "name": "Chinese Diaspora (Migration and Ethnicity)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Diaspora_Migration_and_Ethnicity_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 20433, "name": "History of the Portuguese Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Portuguese_Empire?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 160097, "name": "Urban Morphology and Asian Cities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Morphology_and_Asian_Cities?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 174346, "name": "Architectural Typology and Urban Morphology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architectural_Typology_and_Urban_Morphology?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 174704, "name": "Defence and Strategic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Defence_and_Strategic_Studies?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 214592, "name": "Merchant Shipping/Maritime Economics/shipbuilding/Mediterranean/Shipowners/Maritime Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Merchant_Shipping_Maritime_Economics_shipbuilding_Mediterranean_Shipowners_Maritime_Trade?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 371316, "name": "Melaka architecture and planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Melaka_architecture_and_planning?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 460030, "name": "Kerajaan Srivijaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kerajaan_Srivijaya?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 968791, "name": "Straits of Malacca", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Straits_of_Malacca?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 4302722, "title": "The Singapore and Melaka Straits: Violence, Security and Diplomacy in the 17th Century", "created_at": "2013-08-22T12:31:50.847-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4302722/The_Singapore_and_Melaka_Straits_Violence_Security_and_Diplomacy_in_the_17th_Century?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_4302722", "summary": "The Singapore and Melaka Straits are a place where regional and long-distance maritime trading networks converge, linking Europe, the Mediterranean, eastern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent with key centres of trade in Thailand, Indochina, insular Southeast Asia, China, Korea and Japan. The first half of the seventeenth century brought heightened political, commercial and diplomatic activity to this region. It has long been clear to both the Portuguese and the Dutch that whoever controlled the waters off modern Singapore gained a firm grip on regional as well as long-distance intra-Asian trade. By the early 1600s Portuguese power and prestige were waning and the arrival of the Dutch East India Company constituted a major threat. Moreover, the rapid expansion and growing power of the Acehnese Empire, and rivalry between Johor and Aceh, was creating a new context for European trade in Asia.\r\n\r\nDrawing on maps, rare printed works, and unpublished manuscripts written in Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and Latin, Peter Borschberg provides new information on the diplomatic activities of Asian powers, and shows how the Portuguese and Spanish attempted to restore their political fortunes by containing the rapid rise of Dutch Power in the region. Key documents, transcribed and translated into English for the first time, make up a series of appendices.\r\n\r\nThe product of more than two decades of research in European libraries, archives, The Singapore and Melaka Straits will be of great interest to readers in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, where little is known about this pivotal pre-colonial period. It is also an invaluable resource for historians and other students of early modern Europe and of the European presence in Asia.\r\n\"\"\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50080315, "asset_id":

authors have as much to say about Singapore and the old Johor capital Batu Sawar as Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge (c.1570-1632). This admiral of the Dutch East India Company sailed to Asia in 1605 and besieged Portuguese Melaka in 1606 with the help of Malay allies. A massive Portuguese armada arrived from Goa to fight the Dutch at sea, break the siege and relieve the Portuguese colony. During his Asian voyage and on his return to Europe in September 1608, Matelieff penned a series of letters and memorials in which he provided a candid assessment of trading opportunities and politics in Asia. He advised the VOC and leading government officials of the Dutch Republic to take a long-term view of Dutch involvement in Asia and fundamentally change the way they were doing business there. Singapore, the Straits region, and Johor assumed a significant role in his overall assessment. At one stage seriously contemplated establishing the VOC\u2019s main Asian base at a location near the Johor River estuary. On deeper reflection, however, Matelieff and the VOC directors in Europe began to shift their attention southward and instead began to prefer a location around the Sunda Strait. This was arguably a near miss for Singapore two full centuries before Thomas Stamford Raffles founded the British trading post on the island in 1819. This book is aimed at students, researchers and general readers who are interested in the history of Singapore and Johor as well as in answering the question: Was Singapore\u2019s potential as a strategic and commercial center not recognized before the arrival of the British?\n\nThis book has been published by the National Library of Singapore's Books SG site.

native of Bruges (now part of Belgium), Jacques de Coutre was a gem trader who spent nearly a decade in Southeast Asia in the early 17th century. In addition to a substantial autobiography written in Spanish and preserved in the National Library of Spain in Madrid, he wrote a series of memorials to the united crown of Spain and Portugal that contain recommendations designed to reverse the decline in the fortunes of the Iberian powers in Southeast Asia, particularly against the backdrop of early Dutch political and commercial penetration into the region. Translated into English for the first time, these materials provide a valuable first-hand account of the bigger issues confronting the early colonial powers in Southeast Asia, and deep insights into the societies De Coutre encountered in the territory that today makes up Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37473245, "asset_id": 4302708,

As such, the great carracks that sailed it were obvious targets for the Dutch after they arrived in Asia at the end of the 16th Century. The 1603 capture of the richly laden carrack Santa Catarina by the Dutch captain Jakob van Heemskerck was the first and most famous case in a series of incidents which led the Portuguese to stop using carracks and galleons on their voyages to Macau and Japan in 1618, replacing them with smaller ships such as galleots and pinnaces. In this article, I propose to analyze Dutch attacks on Portuguese ships travelling between Goa and Macau and Japan before 1618, in order to know better the process that led to the replacement of large vessels by smaller ones on the route.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51904432, "asset_id": 2068744, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2549092, "first_name": "Andr\u00e9", "last_name": "Murteira", "domain_name": "fcsh-unl", "page_name": "Andr\u00e9Murteira", "display_name": "Andr\u00e9 Murteira", "profile_url": "https://fcsh-unl.academia.edu/Andr%C3%A9Murteira?f_ri=65822", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4537, "name": "Early Modern Portuguese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Portuguese_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20433, "name": "History of the Portuguese Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Portuguese_Empire?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48774, "name": "Macao", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Macao?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 31570132, "title": "A navega\u00e7\u00e3o portuguesa na \u00c1sia e na rota do Cabo e o corso neerland\u00eas, 1595-1625", "created_at": "2017-02-22T16:58:12.134-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31570132/A_navega%C3%A7%C3%A3o_portuguesa_na_%C3%81sia_e_na_rota_do_Cabo_e_o_corso_neerland%C3%AAs_1595_1625?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_31570132", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51904766, "asset_id": 31570132, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2549092, "first_name": "Andr\u00e9", "last_name": "Murteira", "domain_name": "fcsh-unl", "page_name": "Andr\u00e9Murteira", "display_name": "Andr\u00e9 Murteira", "profile_url": "https://fcsh-unl.academia.edu/Andr%C3%A9Murteira?f_ri=65822", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4537, "name": "Early Modern Portuguese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Portuguese_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20433, "name": "History of the Portuguese Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Portuguese_Empire?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 2276273, "title": "(2012).

Through a careful analysis of European sources, the author assesses the broader consequences of this event and the ensuing international implications. After 1603, the VOC directors and the regents of the Dutch Republic were alerted to how profitable the policy of freebooting and despoiling the enemy could be, while the Portuguese authorities of the Estado da \u00cdndia became aware of their vulnerability in the face of geographical constraints. There is also a discussion of the legal defence of the Dutch interests as presented by Hugo Grotius, the Dutch jurist who has frequently been upheld as the \u201cfather of modern international law\u201d. What becomes very transparent in the course of the present account is how important the Macao merchants really were to the Estado da \u00cdndia, how far their networks of trade spanned deep into Southeast Asia, and how, despite suffering a number of severe setbacks as a result of VOC freebooting activities, they managed to recuperate from these blows with amazing agility and perseverance.

This development was, for instance, manifest in the dress and titles of the rulers of the Vijayanagara Empire. As has been argued, they bore the title of Sultan and on public occasions they appeared in garments fashioned on Persian and Arab clothing. Both adaptations exemplified efforts to connect to the dominant Indo-Islamic world. From Vijayanagara\u2019s fragmentation in the sixteenth century new Hindu-ruled kingdoms arose. We may wonder to what extent those succeeding polities continued practices adopted from Islamic courts. With that question in mind, this paper discusses royal dress at court audiences in four Vijayanagara successor states, chiefly on the basis of embassy reports of the Dutch East India Company and south Indian works of art. It appears that kings could wear a variety of clothing styles at audiences and that influences on these styles now came from multiple backgrounds, comprising diverse Islamic as well as local elements. Further, not all successor states followed the same dress codes as their dynasties modified earlier conventions in different ways, depending on varying political developments.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57385393, "asset_id": 1787731, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 197010, "first_name": "Lennart", "last_name": "Bes", "domain_name": "leidenuniv", "page_name": "LennartBes", "display_name": "Lennart Bes", "profile_url": "https://leidenuniv.academia.edu/LennartBes?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/197010/210675/3104090/s65_lennart.bes.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1434, "name": "Dress Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dress_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3024, "name": "History of India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_India?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3680, "name": "Courts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Courts?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9486, "name": "Representations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Representations?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 31733, "name": "Court Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Court_Culture?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 35653, "name": "South India  (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_India_History_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 98518, "name": "Madurai", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Madurai?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 257634, "name": "Tanjavur Marathi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tanjavur_Marathi?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 330062, "name": "Vijayanagara", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vijayanagara?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 518466, "name": "Ramnad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ramnad?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 685369, "name": "Keladi-Ikkeri Nayakas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Keladi-Ikkeri_Nayakas?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 816869, "name": "Vijayanagara-Nayaka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vijayanagara-Nayaka?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1429424, "name": "Early Modern South India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_South_India?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 8261393, "title": "The Circulation of Leeuwendaalders (Lion Dollars) in England's North American Colonies, 1693-1733", "created_at": "2014-09-09T12:36:10.897-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8261393/The_Circulation_of_Leeuwendaalders_Lion_Dollars_in_Englands_North_American_Colonies_1693_1733?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_8261393", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34679572, "asset_id": 8261393, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11589529, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Kleeberg", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JohnMKleeberg", "display_name": "John Kleeberg", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JohnMKleeberg?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11589529/3360444/3953936/s65_john_m.kleeberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5430, "name": "New York history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_York_history?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7362, "name": "Colonial (American History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_American_History_?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26606, "name": "17th Century Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 49917, "name": "Dutch History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 74968, "name": "Madagascar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Madagascar?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 194324, "name": "History of New York City", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_New_York_City?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 606022, "title": "\"Bitter Enemies or Machiavellian Friends?

Analysing Dutch sources exclusively allows one to be aware of important key-features of Dutch perception, and to obtain an image of the Portuguese presence in the region. With those methodological tools, the official version of bitter rivalry expressed in Portuguese sources can be questioned. Was the Dutch-Portuguese relationship defined by rivalry or was there space for partnership? \n\tSiam (modern Thailand) was an independent kingdom which had never been occupied by the Portuguese or by the Dutch, being for that same reason an ideal field of study. In addition, the interaction between Siamese local powers and Europeans in solving conflicts that resulted from Dutch-Portuguese rivalry is another aspect to be taken into account.\n\tThe Dutch-Portuguese rivalry will be disassembled here, and each part analysed separately. The cooperative moments between the two people disclosed by Dutch sources will have special coverage, as they present us with a renewed perspective of the Luso-Dutch relationship. Finally, through the case study of the bandel de Si\u00e3o (the Portuguese settlement in Ayutthaya) it will be shown how essential Dutch archival material can be for a study of the Portuguese presence in mainland Southeast Asia.\n\nKey-words\n\tSiam; Ayutthaya; VOC; bandel de Si\u00e3o; Dutch-Portuguese rivalry; partnership; perception; \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 3214661, "asset_id": 606022, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 139329, "first_name": "Rita", "last_name": "Bernardes de Carvalho", "domain_name": "ephe", "page_name": "BernardesdeCarvalho", "display_name": "Rita Bernardes de Carvalho", "profile_url": "https://ephe.academia.edu/BernardesdeCarvalho?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/139329/36958/33949/s65_rita.bernardes_de_carvalho.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 867, "name": "Perception", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Perception?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1727, "name": "Early Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 4916, "name": "Portuguese Discoveries and Expansion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portuguese_Discoveries_and_Expansion?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 20433, "name": "History of the Portuguese Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Portuguese_Empire?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 22256, "name": "Identity and Identification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Identification?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 25182, "name": "Iberian overseas expansion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iberian_overseas_expansion?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 166265, "name": "Ayutthaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ayutthaya?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 41825461, "title": "Foreign Devils and Philosophers: Cultural Encounters between the Chinese, the Dutch, and Other Europeans, 1590-1800 (Leiden: Brill, 2020).", "created_at": "2020-02-02T03:18:45.180-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41825461/Foreign_Devils_and_Philosophers_Cultural_Encounters_between_the_Chinese_the_Dutch_and_Other_Europeans_1590_1800_Leiden_Brill_2020_?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_41825461", "summary": "What was the cultural impact of early meetings between Chinese and Europeans?

As a new supplier in the Japanese market, the VOC attempted to import deerskins from Southeast Asian kingdoms. Unlike those imported from Siam, deerskins brought from the aborigines in Taiwan were exempted from official trade barriers between Siam and Japan. The VOC wasted no time trying to take over from the Chinese middlemen deerskin trade with the aborigines in Taiwan and compete with Japanese junk traders who held a Shogunal pass to visit Taiwan. Although deerskins accounted for an insignificant percentage of the total Sino-Japanese trade volume, their trade became a token of legitimacy for the Dutch\u2019s sole control over the Tayouan harbor.  The competition between Dutch and Japanese traders soon spiraled out of control and led to a violent conflict in 1628. All VOC businesses in Japan were suspended until 1633, when the Dutch were preferred to the Iberians by the Japanese Shogun because they were Protestant and not prone to proselytize their religion. The following year, the Japanese Shogunal court implemented a total exclusion policy forbidding Japanese to travel abroad. \n     Deerskin exports from Siam had been in the firm grip of the Japanese community there until their leader, Yamada Nagamasa, became embroiled in the political strife following the death of King Songt\u2019am in 1628. This political turmoil stalled Siamese deerskin exports, leaving a vacuum for Taiwanese deerskins to fill. From 1628 to 1632, the VOC authorities in Taiwan, with no access to the Japanese market, allowed the Chinese in Japan to engage in deerskin trade. Gradually, the profits made from Taiwanese deerskin exports were comparable to those from Siam. When the exclusion policy took effect in 1634 and the VOC trade with Japan resumed, the Siamese deerskin exports never recovered their previous level. Seeing an opportunity, the VOC determined to expand its Taiwanese deerskin exports. It launched a series of expeditions to aboriginal villages on the northern frontier to open deer hunting-grounds to Chinese hunters. The Siamese deerskin exports eventually stabilized in the early 1640s and the impetus of the VOC expansion slackened off accordingly. Around 1645, a new system to collect deerskins was established by the VOC authorities. This so-called \u201cvillage-lease\u201d system guaranteed keeping the Chinese-Aborigine contact to a minimum, while still providing the VOC with a certain amount of deerskins at a fixed price. Tracing the history of deerskin trade initiated by the VOC in Taiwan, the author argues that it served three purposes: to supplement Siamese deerskins, to establish the legitimacy of VOC\u2019s control over Tayouan harbor, and to have exclusive access to the aborigines and all their goods.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55166185, "asset_id": 35305851, "asset_type": "Work",

"work_40997083", "summary": "Historians have often mentioned the privateering activity of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) against Portuguese navigation in Asia. However, there have been almost no attempts to measure the phenomenon quantitatively. This article will present a listing as comprehensive as possible of Portuguese ships lost in Asia and on the Cape of Good Hope route as a result of Dutch attacks during the first quarter of the 17th century. Based on Dutch and Portuguese sources, this extensive sample of losses shall allow for a better knowledge of the numbers, the chronological evolution and the geographical distribution of Dutch attacks on Portuguese shipping in the period. It will be seen that the chronological and regional impact of the attacks varied, mirroring the evolution of the broader Dutch-Portuguese conflict in Asia. There was a peak in the number of Portuguese ships lost to the Dutch in the first decade of the 17th century. This was followed by a drop in the number of ships taken during a relatively quiet phase of the conflict. The short-lived alliance between the Dutch and English East India Companies brought about a new time of escalation and contributed to another period of high losses in 1620\u20131625. Nevertheless, it will be argued that a change in the nature of VOC privateering that took place around the same time in the Straits of Melaka was actually more important.

Cornelis\u2019s text is leading in the analysis and is presented more or less chronological. To be able to distinguish the two authors Cornelis\u2019s text is shown in the analysis with an indentation. Both texts in old Dutch are directly followed by a translation which stays as close as possible to the original text.\n\nThe perspective from which the two books are viewed is a practical one. The questions \u201cWhat did it look like\u201d? and \u201cHow did they do it\u201d? provide the basis. Subject is the establishment of the shape of the hull and if a team of skilled shipwrights would read the text they should be able to build the described ship. The reconstruction of a ship with a length of 155 feet from stem to stern provides the thread in the analysis. This length is chosen because Cornelis provides two comprehensive certers, one of a ship of 155 feet built in 1664 and one of 154 built in 1667 where he gives an enormous amount of information of these closely related and comparable ships. The text is supported by a computer reconstruction in 3D which creates on its own terms the need for precise dimensions and appearances. The text is adapted as new insights emerge and/or additional information is generated for example by discussion and suggestions from people who have read the text and comment on it. I have deliberately chosen this form because it always broadens and deepens my own judgment and insight and this will be beneficial to the text. Nothing is ever really finished.\n\nThe place where to find the quoted passages in the original books is in Cornelis\u2019s case given by a page and a line for example (p.1, l.2), in Nicolaes\u2019s case a column number is added (1 or 2) and the edition is mentioned, for example (p.1, c. 2, l. 3, 1671).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50897572, "asset_id": 30363498, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26011191, "first_name": "Jaap", "last_name": "Luiting", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JaapLuiting", "display_name": "Jaap Luiting", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JaapLuiting?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26011191/7141221/17399063/s65_jaap.luiting.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 26606, "name": "17th Century Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 93769, "name": "Shipbuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shipbuilding?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 406927, "name": "Dutch shipbuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_shipbuilding?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1126452, "name": "Nicolaes Witsen (1641-1717)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nicolaes_Witsen_1641-1717_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1924527, "name": "Cornelis van Yk", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cornelis_van_Yk?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 12363087, "title": "The Sixth Admiralty: The Dutch East India Company and the military revolution at sea, 1652-1665", "created_at": "2015-05-13T01:58:29.188-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12363087/The_Sixth_Admiralty_The_Dutch_East_India_Company_and_the_military_revolution_at_sea_1652_1665?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_12363087", "summary": "Disclaimer: This is the first version of an article later published by the IJMH, find the published version here: http://ijh.sagepub.com/content/26/4/669.abstract \r\n \r\nIn February 1665, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) agreed to equip twenty ships for the Dutch fleet, six of which were specifically named Indiamen. This paper will focus on this episode as the culmination of twenty-five years of VOC involvement in the Republic\u2019s  wars in Europe. During this period the VOC acted at times as a sixth admiralty board. This paper will argue that the ships that the VOC provided in 1665 should not be seen as armed merchantmen, but rather as a distinct type of warship. Drawing on fleet lists and armament figures, the case is made that the VOC provided important support for the fleet. In addition, it is argued that the VOC followed the technical changes in Dutch warship design in this period. The inability to cope with the risk of battlefleet strategy, not technical changes, forced the VOC out of its role as sixth admiralty.

Formed by a merger of six smaller trading firms that traded in the East Indies and backed by a monopoly of trade, this proto-conglomerate emerged as a driving force in globalization, transregional investment, and early European colonization in Asia and Africa. The VOC operated as a profit-driven shareholder corporation and at the apex of its power, around the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries, maintained a series of factories and settlements stretching from Cape Town in Southern Africa, the Malabar and Coromandel coasts of India, Bengal, to insular and mainland Southeast Asia and as far as Taiwan (Formosa) and Japan. Chartered companies possessed considerable investments and infrastructure outside Europe, especially with their administrative apparatus, contacts, business networks, and trading knowledge. This in turn laid the foundations for Dutch imperialism during the 19th century.\nKeywords\nearly globalization, capitalism, international trade, Europe\u2013Asia relations, Asian studies, diplomacy, colonialism, international law\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65734004, "asset_id": 29167993, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1727, "name": "Early Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 15588, "name": "Social History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 49837, "name": "Historia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historia?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 97643, "name": "South East Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_East_Asian_Studies?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 104788, "name": "Hist\u00f3ria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hist%C3%B3ria?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 116212, "name": "Sejarah", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sejarah?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 167916, "name": "Sejarah Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sejarah_Malaysia?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 235694, "name": "Malaysian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 375194, "name": "Melaka History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Melaka_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1019273, "name": "Colonialism and Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism_and_Imperialism?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 49788749, "title": "A late 17th-century 'Double Dutch' construction in the North Frisian Wadden Sea: the case of the H\u00f6rnum Odde wreck on the island of Sylt, Germany", "created_at": "2021-07-12T03:42:21.108-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49788749/A_late_17th_century_Double_Dutch_construction_in_the_North_Frisian_Wadden_Sea_the_case_of_the_H%C3%B6rnum_Odde_wreck_on_the_island_of_Sylt_Germany?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_49788749", "summary": "In October 2016 a previously unknown shipwreck emerged at the southern spit of the island of Sylt as a consequence of an ongoing coastal erosion process.

With a terminus post quem of 1690, this is the latest 'Double Dutch' construction hitherto known, casting doubt on the long-held belief that this peculiar method of construction was a fleeting phenomenon of the early 17th century. Due to tidal currents and erosion, the sea swiftly reclaimed the wreck shortly after the investigation.

These \u2018pithy expressions\u2019, often involving vivid if sometimes cryptic similes, were a form of customary legal lore that was invoked in texts and cited in reaching judgments. As such, these maxims provide a fertile but largely untilled field for legal history and for comparative studies of customary and premodern law. The author is a leading authority on Indonesian legal history, and has published on Javanese legal texts before.

The work re-examines the way in which the growing political, economic and strategic importance of Jamaica as the Crown Colony had corresponded with pirate raids. It extends the area of this subject by the implementation of the complex framework of relations between influential members involved in Jamaican colonial administration and prominent individuals of pirate crews. Hence, one of the central claims of this research is that pirates in seventeenth century functioned as the integral element of British imperial endeavours. Moreover, this study argues that seventeenth-century pirates played a significant role in connecting Britain's empires in the Americas and India by forcing London authorities to impose its central policy on colonies and abandon the concept of decentralised imperial state. \nWhile there is wide agreement that \u201cthe pirate economy\u201d of Jamaica was replaced by the business of plantation, there is less consensus over whether or not the dominance of plantocracy was achieved through legal and ethical means. Extensive research of primary sources has shown that the hegemony of planter's class was rather the outcome of a cunning strategy of land acquisitions accomplished by privileged Assembly representatives such as Thomas Lynch, Peter Beckford or William Beeston. This research drawing on deep analysis of archival sources argues that generations of buccaneers were intentionally driven out of Jamaica by the clique of local representatives of planter\u2019s class led by Thomas Lynch. Thus, this work seeks to clarify the nature of the transformation of Jamaican society by the end of seventeenth century, which should not be perceived as smooth and natural development.\nRather, it should be understood in terms of organised and forced replacement of one class of people with a different class of people, which was more fitting for the whole colonial project. Nevertheless, this research based on archival sources, published manuscripts and judicious use of contemporary sources claims that the abandonment of piratical activities was ill-timed and exposed The British West Indies to significant defensive risks. \nThe dissertation is comprised of five chapters covering five decades of Jamaica's colonial development with an emphasis on three distinct generations yet equally successful piratical societies enjoying endorsement, support, sponsorship or protection by Jamaican colonists. Chapter one looks at the aftermath of the failed Western Design in the Caribbean, expeditions led by Christopher Myngs and the first wave of buccaneers settling down in Port Royal. The second chapter is dedicated to the era of Henry Morgan and his infamous attacks on Spanish colonies. Further, the chapter investigates the establishment of the semi-legal web of interconnected communities of pirates, smugglers, wreckers and \u201cbaymen\u201d. Chapter three considers the nature of the second wave of buccaneering framed by voyages of William Dampier, Bartholomew Sharp and John Coxon. Also, this part comments on the status of indentured servants and the turbulent changes in the composition of Jamaican society. The period of two competing Jamaican political factions of planters and merchants is discussed in the chapter four. Additionally, this section deals with the consequences of the Glorious Revolution (1688) for Jamaica, and it clarifies the link between Tories, Whigs and pirates. The key factors of Jamaica's influence behind the rise of the Red Round piracy are outlined in chapter five It also details the clash of different colonial interests epitomised by numerous conflicts between colonial authorities and the Royal Navy and discusses the impacts of the Treaty of Ryswick (1697). The last section takes the reader to the brink of the War of the Spanish Succession and re-examines the importance of legal changes emphasised by The\nPiracy Act passed by the Parliament of England in 1698. Each chapter provides the reader important contextual information about relevant political, cultural, social, and military events like for instance the Anglo-Dutch Wars or the Nine Years' War.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56446224, "asset_id": 35943697, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 56449210, "asset_id": 35943697, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 38264730, "first_name": "Martin", "last_name": "Mares", "domain_name": "ucl", "page_name": "MartinMares", "display_name": "Martin  Mares", "profile_url": "https://ucl.academia.edu/MartinMares?f_ri=65822", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 724, "name": "Economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economics?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1250, "name": "Latin American and Caribbean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_and_Caribbean_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6873, "name": "Caribbean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caribbean_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7945, "name": "Caribbean Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caribbean_Studies?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 8706, "name": "Jamaica", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jamaica?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 8724, "name": "17th-Century Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th-Century_Studies?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 9830, "name": "History of Piracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Piracy?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 26630, "name": "Age of Sail", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Age_of_Sail?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 26883, "name": "West Indies (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/West_Indies_History_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 27533, "name": "Atlantic history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atlantic_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 37110, "name": "Maritime Piracy and Transnational Criminal Organizations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Piracy_and_Transnational_Criminal_Organizations?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 58505, "name": "Caribbean", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caribbean?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 62467, "name": "Piracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Piracy?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 64964, "name": "Privateering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Privateering?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 69403, "name": "Oliver Cromwell", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oliver_Cromwell?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 82108, "name": "Plantations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Plantations?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 103666, "name": "Pirates", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pirates?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 168567, "name": "Latin America and the Caribbean", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_America_and_the_Caribbean?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 424370, "name": "Merchants, privateers and pirates", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Merchants_privateers_and_pirates?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 521065, "name": "Maratime History 18th Century", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maratime_History_18th_Century?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 622966, "name": "Royal African Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Royal_African_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1381313, "name": "Buccaneers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buccaneers?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 74162857, "title": "De huid van Cleopatra.

Wat was het immigratiebeleid van het Romeinse Rijk en wat voor gevolgen had het? Hoe keek Aristoteles tegen slavernij aan? Dit soort vragen houdt de gemoederen nog altijd bezig en illustreert hoezeer de moderne mens zich aan de (met name Griekse en Romeinse) Oudheid spiegelt of zich er juist tegen afzet. De wijze waarop er nu in Nederland over diversiteit en etniciteit wordt gesproken, verschilt scherp van de concepten die in het oude Egypte, Perzi\u00eb of Griekenland werden gehanteerd. Maar ook in de Oudheid werden huidskleur en andere etnische kenmerken natuurlijk opgemerkt en becommentarieerd, in positieve en negatieve zin. De auteurs van De huid van Cleopatra onderzoeken drie verschillende maar onderling verweven vragen rondom de Oudheid, hier breed opgevat, en etniciteit. Hoe werd er in de Oudheid tegen huidskleur en etnische kenmerken aangekeken? En, hoe hebben door de eeuwen heen de bestudering van de (\u2018Klassieke\u2019) Oudheid en eurocentrische ideologie en politiek elkaar wederzijds be\u00efnvloed?

The Carreira da \u00cdndia, sometimes called in translation the India Run, was the name given to the fleet system responsible for the annual sailings that took place between Portugal and Asia by the way of the Cape of Good Hope route during the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It was almost homonymous with the Spanish transatlantic fleet system, the better-known Carrera de las Indias, and until the seventeenth century its importance to the Portuguese Overseas Empire can be said to be similar to that of the Carrera to the Spanish Empire. During the sixteenth century, the route was sailed almost exclusively by the Carreira\u2019s vessels, but in the seventeenth century the Portuguese ships were exposed to the undesired company of the fleets of the famous English and Dutch East India Companies, founded in 1600 and 1602. The subject of this book - Dutch privateering against the Carreira da \u00cdndia -  - was a result of the new situation: unlike the English, the Dutch were only a menace to the Portuguese on the route to India from the moment ships of the United Provinces of the Netherlands entered the Cape route, after the pioneering voyage of Cornelis Houtman in 1595-1597. The period under study ends in 1625, when the annual number of departures of Portuguese vessels to Asia began to fall decisively, putting an end to a chapter of the history of the Carreira. The book is based on both Portuguese and Dutch primary sources.\r\n\r\nDepois da viagem explorat\u00f3ria de Vasco da Gama em 1497-1499, os portugueses montaram depressa uma liga\u00e7\u00e3o mar\u00edtima regular \u00e0 \u00c1sia, que passou \u00e0 hist\u00f3ria sob o nome de Carreira da \u00cdndia. Durante mais de tr\u00eas s\u00e9culos, a chamada Rota do Cabo da Boa Esperan\u00e7a - ou, mais simplesmente, Rota do Cabo - entre a Europa e o Oriente foi navegada por navios portugueses, que, melhor ou pior, foram mantendo a comunica\u00e7\u00e3o e o com\u00e9rcio entre o reino e as suas possess\u00f5es asi\u00e1ticas, o denominado Estado da \u00cdndia. Durante o s\u00e9culo XVI, a rota foi sulcada em regime de quase completa exclusividade pelas velas da Carreira, mas, no s\u00e9culo XVII, estas passaram a gozar da indesejada companhia das frotas das famosas Companhias das \u00cdndias Orientais inglesa e neerlandesa, fundadas em 1600 e 1602. O presente trabalho trata de um problema directamente decorrente da nova situa\u00e7\u00e3o: o corso neerland\u00eas contra a Carreira da \u00cdndia, que s\u00f3 passou a ser uma amea\u00e7a a partir do momento em que a Rota do Cabo come\u00e7ou a ser navegada tamb\u00e9m pelos navios das Prov\u00edncias Unidas dos Pa\u00edses Baixos, depois da viagem inaugural de Cornelis Houtman pela Rota do Cabo em 1595-1597. O per\u00edodo tratado vai at\u00e9 1625, data a partir da qual o n\u00famero anual de partidas de navios portugueses para a \u00c1sia caiu para n\u00e3o mais recuperar, encerrando-se com isso um cap\u00edtulo da hist\u00f3ria da Carreira. O livro baseia-se em fontes prim\u00e1rias portuguesas e neerlandesas.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 29885295, "asset_id": 2064213, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2549092, "first_name": "Andr\u00e9", "last_name": "Murteira", "domain_name": "fcsh-unl", "page_name": "Andr\u00e9Murteira", "display_name": "Andr\u00e9 Murteira", "profile_url": "https://fcsh-unl.academia.edu/Andr%C3%A9Murteira?f_ri=65822", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4409, "name": "Naval History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Naval_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4537, "name": "Early Modern Portuguese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Portuguese_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20433, "name": "History of the Portuguese Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Portuguese_Empire?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20433, "name": "History of the Portuguese Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Portuguese_Empire?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 67553945, "title": "New York", "created_at": "2022-01-07T12:11:12.805-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/67553945/New_York?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_67553945", "summary": "The ocean has always been the harbinger of strangers to new shores.

Conchophilia delves into the intimate relationship between shells and people, offering an unprecedented account of the early modern era when the influx of exotic shells to Europe fueled their study and representation as never before. From elaborate nautilus cups and shell-encrusted grottoes to delicate miniatures, this richly illustrated book reveals how the love of shells intersected not only with the rise of natural history and global trade but also with philosophical inquiry, issues of race and gender, and the ascent of art-historical connoisseurship.\n\nShells circulated at the nexus of commerce and intellectual pursuit, suggesting new ways of thinking about relationships between Europe and the rest of the world. The authors focus on northern Europe, where the interest and trade in shells had its greatest impact on the visual arts. They consider how shells were perceived as exotic objects, the role of shells in courtly collections, their place in still-life tableaus, and the connections between their forms and those of the human body. They examine how artists gilded, carved, etched, and inked shells to evoke the permeable boundary between art and nature. These interactions with shells shaped the ways that early modern individuals perceived their relation to the natural world, and their endeavors of art and knowledge.\n\nSpanning painting and print to architecture and the decorative arts, Conchophilia uncovers the fascinating ways that shells were circulated, depicted, collected, and valued, during a time of remarkable global change.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67014166, "asset_id": 48381901, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 158864, "first_name": "Claudia", "last_name": "Swan", "domain_name": "wustl", "page_name": "ClaudiaSwan", "display_name": "Claudia Swan", "profile_url": "https://wustl.academia.edu/ClaudiaSwan?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/158864/595529/739987/s65_claudia.swan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7354, "name": "Early Modern Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Europe?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15761, "name": "History of Collections", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Collections?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19627, "name": "Conchology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conchology?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26606, "name": "17th Century Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46654, "name": "Plates and shells", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Plates_and_shells?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 51385, "name": "Still Life", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Still_Life?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 52487, "name": "Rembrandt", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rembrandt?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 76869, "name": "Cabinets of Curiosities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cabinets_of_Curiosities?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 159686, "name": "16th and 17th century Dutch and Flemish Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/16th_and_17th_century_Dutch_and_Flemish_Art?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1228561, "name": "Early Modern Netherlandish Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Netherlandish_Art?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 1188266, "title": "Malintzin, Pocahontas, and Krotoa: Indigenous Women and Myth Models of the Atlantic World", "created_at": "2011-12-30T00:03:51.186-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1188266/Malintzin_Pocahontas_and_Krotoa_Indigenous_Women_and_Myth_Models_of_the_Atlantic_World?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_1188266", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36582987, "asset_id": 1188266, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1081896, "first_name": "Pamela", "last_name": "Scully", "domain_name": "emory", "page_name": "PamelaScully", "display_name": "Pamela Scully", "profile_url": "https://emory.academia.edu/PamelaScully?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1081896/436172/19917057/s65_pamela.scully.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 129, "name": "American History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1726, "name": "Women's History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2272, "name": "Gender History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4121, "name": "Atlantic World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atlantic_World?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 -

Although, in the wake of the Second World War, some pioneer historians and advocates of a unified analysis of the four continents bordering the Atlantic considered southern Africa to be part of this \u2018community\u2019,  this was not borne out in the subsequent developments of Atlantic history which has been little concerned with the deep southern part of the ocean. Thus, a major new synthesis such as Thomas Benjamin\u2019s \u201cThe Atlantic World\u201d contains no discussion of Africa south of Angola and hardly mentions the Cape of Good Hope.  This state of affairs is partly related to the fact that early practitioners of Atlantic history viewed the ocean as \u2018a basin around which a new civilization slowly formed\u2019.  But this basin was not completely bounded or closed-off: the original purpose for crossing the Atlantic was to connect Europe with the East Indies, and this the passage around the Cape of Good Hope in the south Atlantic continued to provide throughout the period covered by this volume (1450-1850), as is increasingly being acknowledged.  But perhaps the main reason for this state of affairs in the historiography of the Atlantic is the result of the isolation of South African historians until the 1980s and their own inward-looking habits and practices.  For a long time historians of the colonial Cape tended to look to the hinterland and the interior of Africa, forgetting that the inhabitants of the Cape during this period were mostly ocean-oriented. This is what will be described in this chapter, which also affords one the opportunity to rethink the traditionally conceived notion of the Atlantic World as being bounded and closed-off. Serving as it did as a pivot between two oceans; the existence of a colonial society at the Cape of Good Hope made possible the development of a globalised, unified oceanic world by the nineteenth century.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60581356, "asset_id": 14846864, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8002573, "first_name": "Gerald",

In Nagasaki, foreign trade became increasingly institutionalized over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the Tokugawa bakufu implemented many trade systems in Nagasaki aimed at securing the influx of Chinese luxury and bulk goods, and at the same time cope with the country\u2019s financial difficulties due to the large outflow of bullion and the exhaustion of the Japanese silver and gold mines. As such, state-supported monopoly merchants controlled foreign trade in Nagasaki, under the supervision of state officials. Much research has these official trade regulations and their practical applications as a focus point. Using the Nagasaki criminal records, this paper instead focuses on smuggling as a way to circumvent these regulations. Furthermore, as a case study, this paper analyzes the smuggling networks featuring in two of the seventeenth century\u2019s famous smuggling cases. These networks show a wide variety of participants with colorful backgrounds and the methods with which they tried to engage in foreign trade, challenging the position of the state-supported monopoly merchants.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54108810, "asset_id": 34191381, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51870550, "first_name": "Jurre", "last_name": "Knoest", "domain_name": "leidenuniv", "page_name": "JurreKnoest", "display_name": "Jurre Knoest", "profile_url": "https://leidenuniv.academia.edu/JurreKnoest?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51870550/14248251/15209495/s65_jurre.knoest.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6727, "name": "Early Modern (Japanese History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Japanese_History_?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54525, "name": "Merchant networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Merchant_networks?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 117492, "name": "Early Modern Japan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Japan?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 159732, "name": "Smuggling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Smuggling?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 174492, "name": "Informal Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Informal_Empire?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 230998, "name": "Criminal Records", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminal_Records?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 301233, "name": "Nagasaki", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nagasaki?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 50889370, "title": "(2019) Van Delft Before Cook: The Earliest Record of Substantial Culture Contact Between Indigenous Australians and the Dutch East India Company Prior to 1770", "created_at": "2021-08-15T21:29:36.380-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/50889370/_2019_Van_Delft_Before_Cook_The_Earliest_Record_of_Substantial_Culture_Contact_Between_Indigenous_Australians_and_the_Dutch_East_India_Company_Prior_to_1770?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_50889370", "summary": "This article details the importance of the 1705 Van Delft expedition for the early European history and culture contacts of northern Australia.

For the most part, the sources available have been scattered letters from Jesuit missionaries and a few (other) Portuguese texts, as well as a number of 17th and 18th century Dutch documents, primarily written by clergy and administrators serving the V.O.C. \nOn the other hand, some of the earliest known Malay language texts, dating from the 17th and 18th centuries and published by the Dutch V.O.C., have more recently become more widely known. It is generally understood that the Malay language was used as a trading language throughout the Indonesian archipelago, however, these early Malay language documents relate not to trade but rather to teaching Christianity, and their existence indicates a commitment to Christianization. This commitment directly contradicts the commonly accepted view of Spanish and Portuguese as Christianizers and the Dutch as money-lovers, rather than being seen as complex agents. In fact, involvement in both religious and economic pursuits is apparent from both the origins of the Portuguese and Spanish expansion in the 15th and 16th centuries and Dutch expansion in the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nThis study seeks to explore this early Christianization in an unusual case, Ambon, whose substantial Christian population converted to Calvinism and has remained Christian up to the present. This includes some consideration of the language of communication, in this case the Malay language, as an essential element which was involved in both Islamization and Christianization. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64040923, "asset_id": 43731227, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1233218, "first_name": "William Bradley", "last_name": "Horton", "domain_name": "akita-u", "page_name": "WilliamBradleyHorton", "display_name": "William Bradley Horton", "profile_url": "https://akita-u.academia.edu/WilliamBradleyHorton?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1233218/448015/558192/s65_william_bradley.horton.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 55431, "name": "Eastern Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eastern_Indonesia?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76375, "name": "Malay Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Language?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 78535, "name": "Missionary", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Missionary?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 159255, "name": "Processes of Conversion (Christianization)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Processes_of_Conversion_Christianization_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 781944, "name": "V.O.C.", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/V.O.C?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 820993, "name": "Ambon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ambon?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 38868007, "title": "China\u2019s Hegemonic Intentions and Trajectory: Will It Opt for Benevolent, Coercive, or Dutch\u2010style Hegemony?", "created_at": "2019-04-19T11:30:52.370-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38868007/China_s_Hegemonic_Intentions_and_Trajectory_Will_It_Opt_for_Benevolent_Coercive_or_Dutch_style_Hegemony?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_38868007", "summary": "This article analyses China's strategic intentions and how these may ultimately project its violent or peaceful hegemonic rise.

set sail from the Dutch Republic for Asia in 1605. He launched an attack on Portuguese Melaka in 1606 and subsequently signed landmark treaties with the rulers of Johor (1606) and Ternate (1607). After returning to the Netherlands in the autumn of 1608, he wrote a series of epistolary reports and memoranda that were carefully studied by leading policy makers in the Republic, among them the renowned jurist Hugo Grotius, and the statesman Johan van Oldenbarnevelt.  \nThese materials yield candid insights into key issues of trade, security, the diplomacy of regional polities and relations with Spain and Portugal, and they contributed substantially to the formulation of early VOC policy for the Southeast Asian region in the period 1605-20. Here translated into English for the first time, and illustrated with 70 drawings and maps from the period, this collection of treaties, reports and excerpts from Matelieff\u2019s travelogue make a substantial contribution to Southeast Asian and early colonial history, international relations and international law. \n(http://nuspress.nus.edu.sg/products/2015-journal-memorials-and-letters-of-cornelis-matelieff-de-jonge-security-diplomacy-and-commerce-in-17th-century-southeast-asia?variant=1302894468)", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40625147, "asset_id": 19447151, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 39599292, "first_name": "NUS Press", "last_name": "Pte Ltd", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "NUSPressPteLtd", "display_name": "NUS Press Pte Ltd", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/NUSPressPteLtd?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/39599292/10891812/12155015/s65_nus_press.pte_ltd.jpg"}, {"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3836, "name": "Maritime Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Law?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5649, "name": "South-East Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South-East_Asia?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 6195, "name": "Portuguese Colonialism and Decolonizaton", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portuguese_Colonialism_and_Decolonizaton?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 47133, "name": "Hugo Grotius", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hugo_Grotius?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 14509070, "title": "Japanese copper on the Dutch market", "created_at": "2015-07-30T06:41:07.591-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14509070/Japanese_copper_on_the_Dutch_market?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_14509070", "summary": "After the output of the three main European copper mining areas (Mansfeld, Tyrol and Neusohl) declined from the second half of the 16th century, Sweden and Japan became the most important copper producers. From the start of the Portuguese, and to a lesser extent Italian spice trade, copper and brassware had been important European trading goods, being shipped all the way to the Indian west coast. Although the American and West African markets kept drawing a lot of European copper and brass, the typical Japanese copper bars gradually took over the Asian market. From as early as 1624, at times of European high conjuncture, the Japanese copper was even imported to the Netherlands by the Dutch East Indian Company, which had a monopoly on Japanese trade. The amounts of Japanese copper on the European markets have always been compared to the Swedish production and export and were regarded as insignificant (Glamann; Heckscher). However, the Asian product clearly dominates the Dutch market in certain periods, specifically 1655-1675 and 1690-1710 (Shimada). These periods coincide with monumental projects as the building of the Amsterdam town hall (today the Royal Palace) and the later years of Rembrandt van Rijn. The Japanese copper might have left its footprint in these artistic highlights and its elemental and isotopic composition might serve as an indication for Dutch provenance.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38335244, "asset_id": 14509070, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1945001, "first_name": "Arie", "last_name": "Pappot", "domain_name": "rijksmuseum", "page_name": "AriePappot", "display_name": "Arie Pappot", "profile_url": "https://rijksmuseum.academia.edu/AriePappot?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1945001/3600640/4224055/s65_arie.pappot.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 53190, "name": "Tokugawa Japan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tokugawa_Japan?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 69579, "name": "Copper extraction and production", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Copper_extraction_and_production?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 80692, "name": "Copper", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Copper?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 680515, "name": "Early Modern Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Trade?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 74935473, "title": "From Moscow to the VOC Cape: Family links between residents of Russia and southern Africa in the early Modern period", "created_at": "2022-03-29T22:32:09.892-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/74935473/From_Moscow_to_the_VOC_Cape_Family_links_between_residents_of_Russia_and_southern_Africa_in_the_early_Modern_period?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_74935473", "summary": "The Swellengrebel family is known in South Africa in connection with Hendrik Swellengrebel, the only local-born governor of the Cape Colony.

The earliest-known correspondence between residents of Russia and the Cape, the letters from Heinrich Swellengrebel in Moscow to his son in Cape Town, was also studied. We established that the Amsterdam burgomaster and friend of Peter I, Nicolaes Witsen, was a patron of Johannes Swellengrebel, a native of Russia and the first Swellengrebel who settled at the Cape. Having achieved a high social status in Russia and at the Cape, members of Swellengrebel family gravitated towards Western Europe, their ancestral homeland.

How did the institution of slavery impact on the practice of Christianity in a Protestant colony such as the Cape of Good Hope? This article investigates this question with a study of how the larger context of church practice and dogma influence the reality of a slave-owning society in the district of Stellenbosch during the VOC era. It shows that although a few slave individuals were baptised in the Dutch Reformed Church, only a very small number of them became actual members of the Church. This, it is argued, was related to the inherent contradiction between the requirements of the Church - that its members be knowledgeable and led moral lives - and the reality of a slave's existence - which allowed little opportunity for free time and study and made relationships between men and women technically illegal by not allowing formal marriage. It is for these reasons that so few slaves could be Christians - at least in the eyes of the official Church - in eighteenth-century Stellenbosch.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60653989, "asset_id": 9183209, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8002573, "first_name": "Gerald", "last_name": "Groenewald", "domain_name": "johannesburg", "page_name": "GeraldGroenewald", "display_name": "Gerald Groenewald", "profile_url": "https://johannesburg.academia.edu/GeraldGroenewald?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8002573/3997984/64659588/s65_gerald.groenewald.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2059, "name": "History of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Religion?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4352, "name": "Religion and Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Colonialism?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5149, "name": "Calvinism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Calvinism?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5432, "name": "Slavery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Slavery?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6283, "name": "History of Slavery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Slavery?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 10106, "name": "Protestantism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Protestantism?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 12616, "name": "Baptism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Baptism?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 12958, "name": "South Africa (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Africa_History_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 14893, "name": "Church History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Church_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 103572, "name": "Dutch Reformed Church", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_Reformed_Church?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 218722, "name": "Dutch overseas history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_overseas_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 365865, "name": "18th Century Cape of Good Hope", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/18th_Century_Cape_of_Good_Hope?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 525471, "name": "Censureship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Censureship?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 752294, "name": "Church Discipline", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Church_Discipline?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 32322417, "title": "Full CV.pdf", "created_at": "2017-04-07T12:03:56.680-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32322417/Full_CV_pdf?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_32322417", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86921126, "asset_id": 32322417, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8301107, "first_name": "Dr. Gerlov", "last_name": "van Engelenhoven MEd.", "domain_name": "uva", "page_name": "GerlovvanEngelenhoven", "display_name": "Dr. Gerlov van Engelenhoven MEd.", "profile_url": "https://uva.academia.edu/GerlovvanEngelenhoven?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8301107/4461647/21912480/s65_gerlov.van_engelenhoven.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 62640, "name": "Postcolonial Theory/Subaltern Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Theory_Subaltern_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 134143, "name": "Politics of Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_Memory?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1158094, "name": "Moluccans In the Netherlands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Moluccans_In_the_Netherlands?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 32617255, "title": "'Drummer Major James Spens: Letters from a Common Soldier Abroad, 1617-1632' in Northern Studies no.47 (2015), pp.76-101", "created_at": "2017-04-24T05:27:03.289-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32617255/Drummer_Major_James_Spens_Letters_from_a_Common_Soldier_Abroad_1617_1632_in_Northern_Studies_no_47_2015_pp_76_101?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_32617255", "summary": "The letters of James Spens represent the only known corpus of letters written by a common soldier from the British Isles during the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648).

Paintings and prints were made for worldwide export; artists depicted foreign rarities; applied arts from Asia were imported on an industrial scale. Famous masters stood out for their interest in remote traditions, from Vermeer\u2019s Chinese porcelain to Rembrandt\u2019s Mughal miniatures and Rubens\u2019s engagement with the worldwide Jesuit mission. This conference identifies and addresses some of the challenges and opportunities that Global Art History offers for the Low Countries. \n\nParticipants explore how artworks were more than illustrations of the interconnectedness of the Early Modern world, with Antwerp and Amsterdam as hubs of global exchange. Everyday lives changed as foreign luxuries became a household presence. Images of real and imagined foreigners circulated on an unprecedented scale. Travelers and scholars pondered unknown iconographies, which sometimes threatened to unsettle the Eurocentric perspective. To explore this global complexity, the conference discusses painting, print, and the applied arts; materials, techniques, and styles; meaning, interpretation, and consumption; and migration, markets, and collections.\n\nAn additional question is how the display and analysis of Dutch and Flemish art has developed into a worldwide phenomenon. The works\u2019 visual language appeals to publics from Japan to Brazil. At the same time the material heritage that documents the entangled histories of the Netherlands and Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Australia is increasingly being foregrounded. What is the continuing relevance of Netherlandish art in a globalized world? \n\nThe conference marks the conclusion of the NWO-funded project The Chinese Impact: Images and Ideas of China in the Dutch Golden Age at Utrecht University.

The signing of the truce treaty had been preceded by a period in which the war went through a process of \u201cglobalization\u201d. While during the first phase of the conflict hostilities were confined to the Low Countries, the sudden expansion of Dutch long-distance overseas trade in the last decade of the sixteenth century took Dutch merchants to several parts of the non-European world where the Hispanic Monarchy viewed them as intruders, opening the door to many Dutch-Iberian clashes far away from Europe (Portugal and its overseas domains were a part of the Hispanic Monarchy between 1580 and 1640). The consequences were especially serious for the Portuguese in Asia, where in 1605 they lost their two important fortresses in the Spice Islands, in Eastern Indonesia, to the newly-formed Dutch East India Company or VOC (Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie). In this article, I attempt to measure how successful the truce was between the Portuguese and the Dutch outside Europe. I allege that there was indeed not a suspension but a marked decrease in intensity in Portuguese-Dutch conflicts in the East between 1609 and 1621, which however had less to do with the truce than with the regional priorities of both the VOC and the Portuguese in Asia. I also attempt to demonstrate that although the truce did not succeed in bringing about a complete cessation of hostilities in the Atlantic, it had more practical effects there than in Asia. This was due, on the one hand, to the suspension of anti-Iberian privateering in waters close to Europe and, on the other, to the effective cancellation until 1621 of the projects to set up a West India Company, which had been imminent before 1609.\r\n\r\nA chamada Tr\u00e9gua dos Doze Anos (1609-1621) entre a Monarquia Hisp\u00e2nica e as Prov\u00edncias Unidas foi antecedida de um per\u00edodo em que o conflito hispano-neerland\u00eas de 1568-1648 se \u201cglobalizou\u201d, em resultado da expans\u00e3o mercantil neerlandesa iniciada na \u00faltima d\u00e9cada do s\u00e9culo XVI, que levou os mercadores neerlandeses a partes do mundo n\u00e3o europeu onde a Monarquia Hisp\u00e2nica n\u00e3o os queria aceitar, conduzindo-os a conflitos frequentes com ib\u00e9ricos longe da Europa. Para os portugueses, o processo foi particularmente humilhante na \u00c1sia, com a conquista de duas pra\u00e7as portuguesas nas Molucas (na Indon\u00e9sia Oriental) pela rec\u00e9m-formada Companhia das \u00cdndias Orientais neerlandesa, ou VOC, na primeira d\u00e9cada do s\u00e9culo XVII. Mas a globaliza\u00e7\u00e3o do conflito hispano-neerland\u00eas tamb\u00e9m atingiu algumas posi\u00e7\u00f5es portuguesas na costa brasileira e na \u00c1frica Ocidental, assim como a navega\u00e7\u00e3o portuguesa no Atl\u00e2ntico em geral. Neste artigo, procuro medir at\u00e9 que ponto a Tr\u00e9gua teve efeito nas \u00e1reas de presen\u00e7a portuguesa longe da Europa. Alego que na \u00c1sia, na segunda d\u00e9cada do s\u00e9culo XVII, se deu uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o de intensidade, mas n\u00e3o uma suspens\u00e3o das hostilidades luso-neerlandesas, menos por efeito da Tr\u00e9gua que das prioridades regionais da VOC. Tento igualmente demonstrar que, no mundo atl\u00e2ntico, a Tr\u00e9gua, embora n\u00e3o tenha tamb\u00e9m implicado a cessa\u00e7\u00e3o completa dos conflitos luso-neerlandeses, teve mais efeitos pr\u00e1ticos que na \u00c1sia, devido, por um lado, \u00e0 suspens\u00e3o do corso neerland\u00eas contra a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ib\u00e9rica perto da Europa e, por outro, ao cancelamento, at\u00e9 1621, dos projectos de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de uma Companhia das \u00cdndia Ocidentais neerlandesa, que estivera iminente antes de 1609. \"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 29980514, "asset_id": 2067736, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2549092, "first_name": "Andr\u00e9", "last_name": "Murteira", "domain_name": "fcsh-unl", "page_name": "Andr\u00e9Murteira", "display_name": "Andr\u00e9 Murteira", "profile_url": "https://fcsh-unl.academia.edu/Andr%C3%A9Murteira?f_ri=65822", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4537, "name": "Early Modern Portuguese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Portuguese_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7088, "name": "History Portuguese and Spanish", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_Portuguese_and_Spanish?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20433, "name": "History of the Portuguese Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Portuguese_Empire?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26606, "name": "17th Century Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42066, "name": "Early modern Spain", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_modern_Spain?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 8259084, "title": "How Should We Approach the Economy of \u2018Early Modern India\u2019?

Furthermore, his view of the economy as being fundamentally driven forward by the rise of a coastal polity expanding inwards from Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta, sits awkwardly with his repeated claim that colonialism was of little significance for Indian economic history. Finally, the present paper suggests that this period might be more fruitfully approached not only by abandoning the telos of what we know of India\u2019s future, but also by adopting both regionally-focused and comparative approaches, turning away from long-distance trade as the primary lens through which to view the economy, and instead examining endogenous factors in the economies of individual regions and enriching our understanding of them by reference to studies of other world regions with comparable patterns of development in the same period. More nuanced ways of approaching economic change in the very long run, including the importance of developments in modes of consumption and market- and profit-oriented economic behaviour, are suggested as a better means of understanding both the economies of the late pre-colonial centuries in the Indian subcontinent, and the development of capitalism, which should also be understood in a more specific manner than Roy allows.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35265811, "asset_id": 8259084, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14613594, "first_name": "Shami", "last_name": "Ghosh", "domain_name": "utoronto", "page_name": "ShamiGhosh", "display_name": "Shami Ghosh", "profile_url": "https://utoronto.academia.edu/ShamiGhosh?f_ri=65822", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1727, "name": "Early Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3024, "name": "History of India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_India?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3619, "name": "Rural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rural_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3620, "name": "Comparative History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5231, "name": "Eighteenth Century History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eighteenth_Century_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 6541, "name": "World History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 13334, "name": "Global History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 18809, "name": "Early Modern economic history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_economic_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 19170, "name": "Agrarian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agrarian_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 19455, "name": "Early Modern economic and social history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_economic_and_social_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 33833, "name": "History of Colonial India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Colonial_India?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 53396, "name": "Local and regional history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Local_and_regional_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 195002, "name": "Social and Economic History of India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Economic_History_of_India?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 217137, "name": "Peasant History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peasant_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 323875, "name": "British East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 413722, "name": "Pre-colonial South Asian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pre-colonial_South_Asian_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 437447, "name": "Early Modern India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_India?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 485267, "name": "South Asian Economy;

Instead, Afrikaans historical linguistics originated at the turn of the 20th century in the very debate about the contribution of slaves and Khoikhoi to the development of Afrikaans. This article traces this history, and demonstrates that considerations of the role of slaves and Khoikhoi in the history of Afrikaans have formed a golden thread in debates about the origins of the language throughout the 20th century until the end of apartheid in 1994. The aims of this article are\ntwofold: to trace how various of the most influential Afrikaans linguists have viewed the role of slaves and Khoikhoi in the genesis of Afrikaans, on the one side; and to investigate how and to what extent they have used external history (as opposed to the internal development of the language) in the construction of their theories, on the other side. The article demonstrates how increasingly Afrikaans linguists have come to realise how and to what an extent history determines the parameters within which linguistic proposals should be sought to trace development of Afrikaans.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82281250, "asset_id": 73949534, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8002573, "first_name": "Gerald", "last_name": "Groenewald", "domain_name": "johannesburg", "page_name": "GeraldGroenewald", "display_name": "Gerald Groenewald", "profile_url": "https://johannesburg.academia.edu/GeraldGroenewald?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8002573/3997984/64659588/s65_gerald.groenewald.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 95, "name": "History of Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Linguistics?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 135, "name": "Intellectual History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intellectual_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1207, "name": "Historical Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Linguistics?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5432, "name": "Slavery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Slavery?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6283, "name": "History of Slavery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Slavery?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 8998, "name": "Pidgins & Creoles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pidgins_and_Creoles?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 12958, "name": "South Africa (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Africa_History_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 16175, "name": "History of Linguistic Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Linguistic_Thought?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 17918, "name": "Intellectual and cultural history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intellectual_and_cultural_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 25270, "name": "Afrikaans (Language and Literature)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Afrikaans_Language_and_Literature_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 30339, "name": "Origin of Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Origin_of_Language?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 62138, "name": "Cape Town", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cape_Town?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 174485, "name": "Cape Colony", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cape_Colony?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 207612, "name": "Pidgins and Creoles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pidgins_and_Creoles-1?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 290465, "name": "Origins and evolution of language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Origins_and_evolution_of_language?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 365865, "name": "18th Century Cape of Good Hope", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/18th_Century_Cape_of_Good_Hope?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1208349, "name": "Khoesan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Khoesan_Studies?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 49560416, "title": "Nancy Jouwe, Matthijs Kuipers and Remco Raben (ed.)

Throughout her forty-year career (1972-2012) as an archivist at the Indonesian National Archives (ANRI), she became the gatekeeper to the VOC (Dutch East India Company) records held in Jakarta (pre-1942, Batavia). Her role as Assistant Conservator at ANRI between 1999 and 2008, was central to the success of the TANAP (Towards A New Age of Partnership) project (1999-2007), which involved a major cooperation between the Dutch National Archives (Archief Nationaal) in the Hague, Leiden University and ANRI for the training of young researchers and curators in the seventeenth and eighteenth-century VOC archives. Mona\u2019s key position made possible the opening of the largest collection of VOC documents in the world\u2014some two kilometres archives comprising nearly ten million pages of documents at ANRI, one million of which are now accessible online thanks to the website established by the project head, Dr Pieter Koenders of Leiden University (http://www.tanap.net/). The following is an appreciation of Mona Lohanda's life and work, along with a Selective Bibliography of her works (nearly complete up to 2010 less so thereafter) which will be published in early 2022 in a Buku Tribute, edited by Andi Achdian et al, and published by MSI Press in Jakarta It has also been published in English in Archipel (Paris) 102 (HIver 2021), pp.9-18, which can be accessed (read only) at https://journals.openedition.org/archipel.

This leads me to the central question of the paper: how were the customs, manners and laws inherited from the Dutch Republic changed and adapted in a different socio-economic context, in particular a colonial situation marked by huge differences in power between the free and unfree, and by the formation of new identities and status groups, increasingly marked by an awareness of race? How did men and women of European descent at the Cape view their own honour with regards to sexual morals, how did others view their actions, and how did these attitudes change over time in a setting which became socially and politically more complex? \nThe first section deals with the ways in which women viewed and defended their sexual honour and does so through the lens of breach of promise cases, especially ones which involved pre-marital births. Whereas in the Dutch Republic a whole repertoire of informal actions existed through which women could restore their honour, at the Cape they mostly turned to the courts (either the matrimonial or the civil court). In these cases they often produced testimonies of their honourable conduct, revealing their own perception of themselves and that of the community. Interestingly, in most cases the woman herself brought the action, and not her father, indicating the importance of personal honour in sexual matters. In cases where the men in question could not be convinced to honour their promise of marriage, the women\u2019s loss of honour was \u2018amended\u2019 through monetary awards. \nThe second section investigates how the sexual behaviour of colonist men affected their perceived status in society. I do so by focusing on cases of divorce on the basis of adultery involving slave women. Roman-Dutch law considered sex with any person except one\u2019s spouse adultery, and did not allow a difference in status to affect the crime (unlike Roman and Germanic law where sex with a slave did not constitute adultery). This may be the case in law, but was more social opprobrium at the Cape attached to colonist men who cheated on their wives with slave and Khoi women? I discuss these issues with relation to cases from the 1760s-1780s which caused much stir. I demonstrate that these seemingly private affairs impacted on the public standing of prominent men who could be ruined and stripped of their public honour through their private misconduct in a society which was becoming more and more aware of social and racial status differentiation. \nThe third section picks up on the issue of how the public censure of private morality changed over time and increasingly started to involve race. Here I discuss the treatment of children born out of wedlock by the Dutch Reformed Church, in particular their admittance to the sacrament of baptism. Whereas for most of the Dutch period, the Church had no qualms about admitting such children, this started to change significantly in the 1780-90s when the morality of unmarried mothers was being questioned and sometimes publicly censured. This change was the result of the impact of pietist and Enlightenment ideas about the behaviour of \u2018a good mother\u2019 at the Cape, within the context of a rapidly changing society during the Revolutionary wars. The fact that this moral regulation was aimed at mostly working class women, often of mixed race, paved the way for the more familiar public discussion and concern over morality of the nineteenth century.

Among other places in Asia, it operated in Mughal India as well throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries until its dissolution, when the English East India Company (EIC) took over political power. The base of the EIC was Bengal, which also witnessed a considerable Dutch presence in the previous years. The arrival of the VOC in Bengal was first registered around Pipli in 1615. 1 At this time, the Dutch Company had already set up its bases in other places like Surat, the coast of Coromandel and Mal abar. However, in Bengal, the VOC was yet to make its mark. By the end of the seventeenth century, the number of Dutch factories in this region had multiplied with the VOC trying to consolidate its position. A lot has been written about the EIC's activities in Bengal in this century. Rila Mukherjee points out how the English discourse in these years began producing a stereotypical image of Bengal. Prompted by the English ambassador, Thomas Bowrey's narratives, an image of 'Brand Bengal' was born. 2 While this was, indeed, a significant phenomenon, the Dutch presence in Bengal was probably as important in the beginning as its English counter part's. Despite this, very little scholarly attention has been given to studying the VOC in this region and not much research has been done on Dutch visions of seventeenth-century Bengal.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64390378, "asset_id": 44049321, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 776254, "first_name": "Byapti", "last_name": "Sur", "domain_name": "thapar", "page_name": "ByaptiSur", "display_name": "Byapti Sur", "profile_url": "https://thapar.academia.edu/ByaptiSur?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/776254/262305/16378187/s65_byapti.sur.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1727, "name": "Early Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6888, "name": "Indian Ocean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 150085, "name": "Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bengal?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 25314125, "title": "Paternic\u00f2, Luisa M. - C. von Collani - R.

The radix China was carried from China to India, while the putchock was carried the other way around. They were carried by official traders belonging to Vietnam, Siam, Ryukyu, Java and so forth. Along with the expansion of European intervention in trans-oceanic trade from the 16th century onward, European chartered companies gradually replaced the Southeast Asian tributary traders and became the main carriers of these trades.

Contemporary reports by visitors abound with references to how difficult the Khoi language was to learn, while at the same time commending the Khoikhoi for their ability to learn European languages. By about 1700, only half a century after Dutch colonisation, most Khoikhoi living in the colonised areas of the Western Cape could speak some form of Dutch in addition to their own language. However, the rapid spread of European settlers deeper into the interior, on the one hand, and the acculturation of the Khoikhoi and their inclusion in the colonial polity and economy, on the other hand, meant that by the end of the eighteenth century Khoi was spoken only on the fringes of the Cape colony. Cape Khoi was increasingly replaced by (a form of) Dutch as the first language of the native inhabitants of the Cape. Thus, on his tour of Southern Africa in 1803-1806, Heinrich Lichtenstein could observe that \u2018on the borders alone are some Hottentots to be found who speak their own lariguage; but among them several foreign words are introduced, spoken with the Hottentot accent and snort\u2019. Cape Khoi was by this stage rapidly dying out.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60580706, "asset_id": 7894472, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

There has been, however, a significant amount of historiography that has developed in the recent decades on Indo-Dutch contacts based on the information available in the sources. This article aims to add more nuances to these dynamics, by showing how the Company and its officials were seen by the locals in Bengal. It argues that the local\u2013Dutch relation had not just been about static characterisations of 'partnership', 'cooperation' or 'conflict', but was rather dependant on personal networks and profit motives backed by diverse social positions. The Dutch in the perception of the locals had different meanings, images and implications.

In the arts, it was the age of Rembrandt and Vermeer. Politically, the Netherlands secured independence from Spain, becoming a sovereign state in 1648 at the conclusion of the Eighty Years War. Over the course of the first half of the century, the small nation sought to establish a place in global trade and the nascent power engaged in diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire and other Muslim powers. Central to the political and cultural emergence of the Dutch Republic were curious foreign goods known as rarities. Rarities of These Lands offers a novel and compelling account of an overlooked yet central aspect of this momentous period in Dutch history\u2014its exoticism.\r\n\r\nIn this deeply researched and exquisitely illustrated book, Claudia Swan examines how foreign goods and encounters informed the art, trade, and diplomacy of the young nation. Her insightful analysis of how the Dutch came to possess, represent, and exchange such \u201cexotic\u201d goods as porcelain, lacquerware, silks, and birds of paradise shows how the emerging republic was seen and portrayed as the preeminent source of these goods, and how it turned foreign objects into expressions of its national self-understanding.\r\n\r\nRarities of These Lands illuminates the formative years of the Dutch Republic, offering an innovative examination of the ways trade, politics, and material culture became entangled as the new nation took shape on the global stage.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67233769, "asset_id": 47890977, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 158864, "first_name": "Claudia", "last_name": "Swan", "domain_name": "wustl", "page_name": "ClaudiaSwan", "display_name": "Claudia Swan", "profile_url": "https://wustl.academia.edu/ClaudiaSwan?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/158864/595529/739987/s65_claudia.swan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 138, "name": "Diplomatic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomatic_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7354, "name": "Early Modern Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Europe?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13966, "name": "History of Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Art?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26606, "name": "17th Century Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 27976, "name": "17th Century Netherlandish Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Netherlandish_Art?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 49917, "name": "Dutch History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 159686, "name": "16th and 17th century Dutch and Flemish Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/16th_and_17th_century_Dutch_and_Flemish_Art?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 882787, "title": "Preliminary Report on the Excavation of the 17th\u2010Century Anglo\u2010Dutch East\u2010Indiaman Avondster in Bay of Galle, Sri Lanka", "created_at": "2011-09-03T19:21:25.546-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/882787/Preliminary_Report_on_the_Excavation_of_the_17th_Century_Anglo_Dutch_East_Indiaman_Avondster_in_Bay_of_Galle_Sri_Lanka?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_882787", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 5335013, "asset_id": 882787, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 172343, "first_name": "Dr. Christine", "last_name": "Ketel", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ChristineKetel", "display_name": "Dr. Christine L .

We evaluate their authenticity using comparative studies with similar contemporaneous Dutch inscriptions, placing them within the broader context of pseudoarchaeology and the public preoccupation surrounding shipwrecks. The morphology and manufacture of the lettering argues against a 17th or 18th century provenance. Further, photographic records of the Zuiddorp site indicate that its associated inscription is modern. We argue these inscriptions were likely attempts by enthusiasts to \u2018participate\u2019 in the shipwrecking stories, or to claim some recognition with regards to the wrecks. Whatever the reasons, they have been used as evidence to support unorthodox hypotheses about the shipwrecks\u2019 survivors, and serve to keep these theories alive in the public imagination.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32879473, "asset_id": 5891816, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 411477, "first_name": "Mark", "last_name": "Polzer", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "MarkPolzer", "display_name": "Mark E .

The method is illustrated by looking at the testimonies of the so-called Chinese rebellion in Batavia in 1740, when ethnic labels could be a matter of life or death.

Both in trials and theatre performances the complaining party is positioned against someone who defends the accused person or issue, each propagating different viewpoints towards a case, whereupon a judge has to decide on the matter. In the early modern era, plays served as experimental sites to conduct (fictional) cases. When the theatre curtain comes down, the audience is incited to express its opinion on the case that was staged. The case that takes central stage in this article is the accusation of Dutch colonial slavery in Dirk van Hogendorp's antislavery drama Kraspoekol, of de slaaverny (1800). This play was highly controversial and its performance in The Hague caused great tumult. Drawing on studies of early modern and contemporary theatre, this contribution will examine the interlace of Kraspoekol and legal practice by looking at accusations (by slaves and abolitionist characters) and defences (by slave master Kraspoekol). The article addresses how the combination of showing and phrasing injustice might encourage Kraspoekol's audience to ascribe itself the role by the judge and to condemn not only the wrongful treatment of the characters of Kraspoekol, but the entire slavery institution.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56346437, "asset_id": 27004346, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

"dom_id": "work_919493", "summary": "\"The Dutch East India Company (VOC) established their settlement at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652 in order to refresh passing trade ships with fresh water, vegetables, and meat in hopes of lessening disease and death during the long voyages around the tip of Africa between Europe and the Far East. The great demand for meat provided an impetus for Dutch-Khoehoe interactions which ultimately drained the Khoekhoe of their wealth, land, and identity. Currently, with the exception of the terrestrial faunal from Oudepost I (Cruz-Uribe and Schrire 1991), historic period faunal analyses at the Cape have been very localized, superficially descriptive, and taphonomically flawed, which has led to very little understanding of the overall colonial meat market and included some implausible interpretations.\r\n\r\nThis thesis takes into account contextual evidence, applies zooarchaeological methodology, and incorporates actualistically-based research into taphonomic traces on bone surfaces and to better reconstruct the originally deposited samples. The investigation of the VOC\u2019s meat industry that was emplaced at the Cape is carried out through the investigation of five faunal samples including three sites from the Castle of Good Hope; the Moat, the Granary (F2), and Donkergat (DKG); Elsenburg; and the Dump from Oudespost I. The systemic approach provides information about livestock production, slaughter, and consumption at the Cape with information about large scale slaughter for local markets or trade ship provisioning. This thesis describes the transplanted European husbandry practices as the VOC overcame initial hardships of meeting high meat demands to become the dominant power across the landscape.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33792091, "asset_id": 919493, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 434812, "first_name": "Adam", "last_name": "Heinrich", "domain_name": "monmouth", "page_name": "AdamHeinrich", "display_name": "Adam Heinrich", "profile_url": "https://monmouth.academia.edu/AdamHeinrich?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/434812/324236/1638225/s65_adam.heinrich.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1624, "name": "Zooarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zooarchaeology?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2795, "name": "Landscape Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Landscape_Archaeology?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2989, "name": "World Systems Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Systems_Analysis?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 8536, "name": "Hybridization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridization?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 12958, "name": "South Africa (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Africa_History_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 15780, "name": "Taphonomy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Taphonomy?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 33105, "name": "Ancient Husbandry & Livestock (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Husbandry_and_Livestock_Archaeology_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 37256, "name": "Archaeology of Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_Identity?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 47094, "name": "Faunal Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Faunal_Analysis?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 62138, "name": "Cape Town", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cape_Town?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 85315, "name": "Mercantilism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mercantilism?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 365865, "name": "18th Century Cape of Good Hope", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/18th_Century_Cape_of_Good_Hope?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 538424, "name": "Archaeology of Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_Colonialism?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 77547854, "title": "Th\u00e9i\u00e8res Chinoises de Yixing pour l'Europe", "created_at": "2022-04-25T03:26:42.907-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77547854/Th%C3%A9i%C3%A8res_Chinoises_de_Yixing_pour_lEurope?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_77547854", "summary": "This February 1996 typescript is a synthesis of the author's work on ancient Yixing teapots; it foreshadows the book that will be published four years later, in 2000: Yixing, Teapots for Europe.

This gives a different meaning to the presence of the girmitya diaspora in the various countries where they are found.\n\nThe Gangetic Plain \u2013 from where the vast majority of indentures came \u2013 for millennia has been at the centre of India\u2019s empires, mythology, economy, culture, philosophy, politics, and military might. Given this background, for much of human history, many peoples have attempted \u2013 and sometimes succeeded \u2013 in taking over this vast, wealthy and globally important territory.\n\nAs so vividly brought to life in Amitav Ghosh\u2019s Sea of Poppies trilogy, Indian indentureship is intimately tied to the opium trade and the East India Company, as impoverished Indians were essentially economic refugees, trafficked to the plantations of Mauritius, Guyana, Trinidad, Fiji, South Africa, and up and down the Caribbean in the aftermath of slavery. This human trafficking was also organized by the rapacious East India Company.\n\nThe Indian Mutiny in 1857 was against the Company \u2013 the most powerful corporation in human history, to which the description \u201cevil\u201d is often applied. The Mutiny ended the Company, which was a remarkable feat. Many mutineers were also sent or fled to the plantations of the British Empire in the aftermath of the conflict.\n\nNotably, also, the end of Indian indenture in 1920 was perhaps the first major victory of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and the Indian nationalist movement, which eventually led to India\u2019s freedom.\n\nWithout understanding the wider contexts in which Indian indentureship occurred and was abolished, we impoverish our understanding of the history of the peoples of Indian origin in the various plantation countries, and the role that they can still play in the shaping of world history, now that in at least four countries, they are powerful players in national \u2013 and therefore international \u2013 politics.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64246972, "asset_id": 43922608, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8319598, "first_name": "Kirk", "last_name": "Meighoo", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "KirkMeighoo", "display_name": "Kirk Meighoo", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/KirkMeighoo?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8319598/4514052/5889183/s65_kirk.meighoo.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6873, "name": "Caribbean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caribbean_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7945, "name": "Caribbean Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caribbean_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13144, "name": "Indian Diaspora (Migration and Ethnicity)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Diaspora_Migration_and_Ethnicity_?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15696, "name": "Indian nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_nationalism?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43251, "name": "Indo-Caribbean Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indo-Caribbean_Diaspora?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 50908, "name": "Opium Trade in China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Opium_Trade_in_China?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 53334, "name": "Indian Indenture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Indenture?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 58559, "name": "East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65725, "name": "Indo-Caribbean Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indo-Caribbean_Culture?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 133242, "name": "Gandhian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gandhian_Studies?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 173734, "name": "Indian Independence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Independence?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 173739, "name": "Indian National Congress", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_National_Congress?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 244476, "name": "Indentured Labour", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indentured_Labour?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 261158, "name": "Indenture System", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indenture_System?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 323875, "name": "British East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 471889, "name": "Caribbean Indentured Labour", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caribbean_Indentured_Labour?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 542564, "name": "Indentured labour migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indentured_labour_migration?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 688218, "name": "East Indian Indentureship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Indian_Indentureship?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1540459, "name": "History of Indenture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Indenture?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 43259306, "title": "The Military Revolution and European Wars Outside of Europe: The Portuguese-Dutch War in Asia in the First Quarter of the Seventeenth Century", "created_at": "2020-06-04T15:50:20.773-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43259306/The_Military_Revolution_and_European_Wars_Outside_of_Europe_The_Portuguese_Dutch_War_in_Asia_in_the_First_Quarter_of_the_Seventeenth_Century?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_43259306", "summary": "This article discusses Portugal's defeat in the Portuguese-Dutch war in Asia during the first quarter of the seventeenth century, focusing on the much-debated issue of whether a military revolution in Europe produced a military exceptionalism that made Europeans militarily superior to non-Europeans in the Early Modern period.

They are found to encode an ambivalent orientation between African and maritime, and Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds, and are suggestive of a formative worldling of the local literary scene from offshore. The article proceeds to propose that the intersecting portal comprising the Cape \u2014 at the seam of the world-system and the boundary of Africa \u2014 provides an entry point into current debates on world literature, and invites modes of reading that are simultaneously close and distant, local and global.\nAvailable at: http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/axR3CzEFhudcVmigUNyy/full",

Colonial societies were extremely complex places, where race, occupation, religion, class, and legal status constantly interplayed and directed the definition of social boundaries. Instead of thinking in terms of ethnic segregation as presented in the colonial records, this contribution proposes to think in terms of 'moral communities'. By so doing, we might be able to balance better between 'Closeness and Proximity' in colonial societies. We can thus try to visualise colonial society not primarily as a hierarchical order with fairly strict or at least distinctive internal boundaries as defined by the colonial authorities, but as a society of different and overlapping socio-cultural spheres and as circles of trust rather than of bounded ethnic communities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63596241, "asset_id": 43314904, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 519115, "first_name": "Remco", "last_name": "Raben", "domain_name": "uu", "page_name": "RemcoRaben", "display_name": "Remco Raben", "profile_url": "https://uu.academia.edu/RemcoRaben?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/519115/182273/212461/s65_remco.raben.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 13884663, "title": "Review of Adam Clulow, \"The Company and the Shogun: The Dutch Encounter with Tokugawa Japan\".

The burgher protest movement was not a movement of all burghers against the Company, but of a certain faction of burghers against other factions with closer ties to the administration.\r\nThis chapter examines the burghers in the protest movement, both as individuals and as a group, in terms of their numbers; status, occupation, class position and family and business relations and in comparison with the wider burgher population of the town. It will also examine the close-knit urban elite consisting of prominent burghers and Company officials, and a small group of wealthy landowners in the direct vicinity of Cape Town, who did not associate with the protesters. A picture emerges of an involved network of personal and material relationships between burghers and Company officials which dominated political life and copied the Dutch urban faction system.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38737150, "asset_id": 1456331, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 304653, "first_name": "Teun", "last_name": "Baartman", "domain_name": "uct", "page_name": "TeunBaartman", "display_name": "Teun  Baartman", "profile_url": "https://uct.academia.edu/TeunBaartman?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/304653/75148/8541661/s65_teun.baartman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2089, "name": "Social Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Identity?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9671, "name": "Factions (Early Modern History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Factions_Early_Modern_History_?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12958, "name": "South Africa (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Africa_History_?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 62138, "name": "Cape Town", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cape_Town?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 360858, "name": "Burgher Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Burgher_Identity?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 365865, "name": "18th Century Cape of Good Hope", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/18th_Century_Cape_of_Good_Hope?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 765943, "name": "Burgerschap", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Burgerschap?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 73892855, "title": "Recensione di Andrew Phillips, J.C.

However, the historical literature also tends to qualify the company's directors as truly professional. This raises the question of why substantive attempts to counter the VOC's decline were never made. A survey of the company's three important domains of activity-the Asian branch, the metropolitan upper echelons, and shipping between Europe and Asia-yields a view of the VOC as an organization where trade-offs and dilemmas were consciously addressed. Nonetheless, as the VOC struggled to reconcile long-term goals with short-term exigencies, managerial action was often ambivalent or inconsistent. Although this mode of decision making was not sufficient to prevent the company\u2019s eventual\ndownfall, it should not be mistaken for rigid inactivity. The VOC is in effect an optical illusion: \u201cRational\u201d economic coordination at the dawn of modern\ncapitalism was not so much a function of an autonomous economic logic, as commonly believed, as it was of pragmatism and social construction.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61046885, "asset_id": 40766856, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1654205, "first_name": "Wim", "last_name": "van Lent", "domain_name": "meribhainskodandakyunmaara", "page_name": "WimvanLent", "display_name": "Wim van Lent", "profile_url": "https://meribhainskodandakyunmaara.academia.edu/WimvanLent?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1654205/4204947/53303827/s65_wim.van_lent.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 39041123, "title": "The company as family: familial relations, marriage networks and the Dutch East India Company", "created_at": "2019-05-07T02:07:45.597-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39041123/The_company_as_family_familial_relations_marriage_networks_and_the_Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_39041123", "summary": "This is the draft of a paper I presented at the ESHCC conference in Valencia in 2016.

The corollary of this development was the subjugation of the indigenous Khoikhoi and San inhabitants of the region, and the importation and use of a relatively large slave labor force in the agrarian and urban economies. The colony continued to expand throughout the 18th century due to continued immigration from Europe and the rapid growth of the settler population through natural increase. During that century, about one-third of the colony's population lived in Cape Town, a cosmopolitan harbor city with a large transient, and overwhelmingly male, population which remained connected with both the Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds. The unique society and culture that developed at the Cape was influenced by both these worlds. Although in many ways, the managerial superstructure of the Cape was similar to that of a Dutch city, the cosmopolitan and diverse nature of its population meant that a variety of identities and cultures co-existed alongside each other and found expression in a variety of public forms.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82183962, "asset_id": 73803960, "asset_type": "Work",

Malaysia today includes not only the southern part of the Malay Peninsula, but also the states of Sabah and Sarawak in the northern part of the island of Borneo. The people of Borneo are Austronesian or Malayo-Polynesian with the largest ethnic on Sabah being the Kadazandusen and on Sarawak it is the Ibans. The earliest people on the Malay peninsula were the Orang Asli,   their descendants being the Negritos, Senois, and Jakun. The Orang Asli  mixed with Mongols who had migrated south from Yunnan province in China creating the Malay ethnic group.  During the seventh and eighth centuries\nA. D. people from Sumatra (Indonesia today) and Thailand added to the mixture. During the second millennium A.D. Muslim, Arabs, and Persian introduced Islam to the peninsula. Other groups include the Minangkabaus from Sumatra, the Bugis from the Celebes (Sulawesi today), and the Champs from southern Vietnam.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s and Singapore\u2019s location along the Strait of Melaka (Malacca) made them important to trade routes between the India Ocean and the South China Sea. Indian traders introduced Buddhist and Hindu prayers and rituals to the region. In the Sumatran principality of Palembang there developed the Buddhist Srivijaya Empire circa 683 A.D. that dominated the Strait of Melaka. In the fourteenth century the kingdom Majapahit in eastern Java replaced the Srivijaya Empire, and resentment against them let to a member of the Palembang royal family named Parameswara to declare himself the leader of the Malays and the creation of the Melaka sultanate. In the 1390s Parameswara established their base on the island of Memasek (Singapore today). Later he moved his capital to the northwest port town of Melaka on the east bank so the Strait of Melaka.\n\nIn the early sixteenth century the Portuguese began to arrive. In 1511 Alfonso de Albuquerque forced the ruling family of Melaka to flee their town for the southeastern section of the Malay Peninsula, where they established the Malay kingdom of Johor. In 1580 the kingdoms of Portugal and Spain were united under the Spanish Habsburg kings. At the same time the Netherlands gained its independence from Spain and established the Dutch East India Company (VOC) to gain a foothold in the spice trade. The VOC established a trading post named Batavia (later Jakarta) the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. In 1640 Portugal left the so-called Iberian Union, and the VOC took advantage of the Portugal\u2019s split with Spain to occupy Melaka. \n\nIn the late eighteenth century, English traders began to make contact with local royal courts on the Malay Peninsula. In 1783 the Shah of Kedah, seeking protection from Siam (Thailand today) and Burma (Myanmar, today) offered an English trader a lease on Penang Island off the northwest coast of the Malay peninsula. The trader founded the town of Georgetown on the island. In 1795 the British convinced the Dutch King William, who had fled to England when the French took over the Netherlands, to allow the British to occupy Melaka. In 1819 the British East India Company signed a treaty with sultan of Johor ceding the island of Singapore to Britain. The British also occupied Melaka (Malacca) and Penang, which together became known as the Straits Settlements. The British also encouraged large numbers of Chinese and Indians to migrate to their colony. The British did not intervene in the northmost sultanates of Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan, and Terengganu that were under Siamese influence because it viewed Siam as a buffer against the French in Indochina. But in 1895 Britain annexed them to Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang to form the Federated Malay States with its capital in Kuala Lumpur. In 1946 Britain combined the Federated Malay States with the Straits Settlements (Melaka and Penang) to form the Malayan Union, which was renamed the Federation of Malaya in 1948. In 1957 the Federation of Malaya achieved its independence, and in 1963 it annexed North Borneo (Sabah today), Sarawak, and Singapore to become Malaysia. In 1965 Singapore left Malaysia to become a sovereign city-state.\n\nMalaysia and Singapore developed in different ways because of a different ethnic mixture. In Singapore 70 percent of the populations is Chinese with a minority of 13 percent Malay, 9 percent Indian. Buddhism is the largest religion with 33 percent of the population, and 24 percent Muslim. In Malaysia 69 percent of the population is Bumiputera (Malay and the indigenous ethnic groups on the island of Borneo, on 25 percent ethnic Chinese, and 7 percent Malaysian Indian. Islam is the largest religion with 61 percent of population followed by 20 percent Buddhist, and 6 percent Hindu. Ethnic Chinese make up about 25 percent of the population, and Malaysian Indian about 7 percent. The official language of Malaysia is Bahasa Malaysia, a standardized form of the Malay language. While Malaysia is technically a secular state, Islam is designated as the \u201creligion of the Federation.\u201d About 61 percent of the population is Muslim, 20 percent Buddhist, 9 percent Christian, 6 percent Hindu, and 1 percent either Confucian, Tao, or followers of other traditional Chinese religions.

Dutch and English in the economic zone of the Indian Ocean in the early modern period (sixteenth \u2013 early nineteenth century). This activity is compared by the goals set by its agents, the methods used by them and the results achieved for the Indo-oceanic economy. The inseparable connection of economic and non-economic aspects of the European activity in the Orient is stressed.

During its founding years, the free inhabitants all shared the same socio-economic background, yet three to four generations later a stratified society had developed with a clearly identifiable elite. Partly this was the result of some burghers amassing large capital resources through utilising the possibilities afforded by the lucrative alcohol trade. A large measure of this success was due to the exploitation of an intricate network of connections built up through kinship and social capital. This article concentrates on the cultural aspects of the lives of the most successful alcohol entrepreneurs, taking a multi-generational view. If they were the financial elite of Cape Town, were they also the social and cultural ones? How did they view themselves and how were they viewed by others? In order to answer these questions the article uses Bourdieu\u2019s concept of \u2018symbolic capital\u2019, arguing that it operated in tandem with economic and social capital. Two broad aspects of the cultural lives of wealthy alcohol traders are addressed. Firstly, the article discusses their consumption patterns and the use of material culture in showcasing their wealth such as choice of address, the use of slaves and carriages, and the display of jewellery, paintings and curtains. Secondly, it investigates to what extent these people\u2019s status was acknowledged by others \u2013 both in concrete terms by being elected to major civic functions (especially in the burgher militia) and in symbolic terms, notably their role in formal processions through the town.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60654034, "asset_id": 9159374, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8002573, "first_name": "Gerald", "last_name": "Groenewald", "domain_name": "johannesburg", "page_name": "GeraldGroenewald", "display_name": "Gerald Groenewald", "profile_url": "https://johannesburg.academia.edu/GeraldGroenewald?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8002573/3997984/64659588/s65_gerald.groenewald.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 27, "name": "Entrepreneurship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Entrepreneurship?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 136, "name": "Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 972, "name": "Self and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_and_Identity?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2089, "name": "Social Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Identity?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 12958, "name": "South Africa (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Africa_History_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 13775, "name": "History of Elites", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Elites?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 15775, "name": "History of Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Identity?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 25552, "name": "Consumption and Material Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Consumption_and_Material_Culture?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 35704, "name": "Identity Formation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Formation?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 49209, "name": "Material Culture and Consumerism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_and_Consumerism?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 62138, "name": "Cape Town", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cape_Town?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 77274, "name": "Symbolic Capital", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Symbolic_Capital?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 218722, "name": "Dutch overseas history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_overseas_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 300568, "name": "Sumptuary Legislation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sumptuary_Legislation?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 365865, "name": "18th Century Cape of Good Hope", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/18th_Century_Cape_of_Good_Hope?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 5601598, "title": "\"A Mother Makes No Bastard\": Family Law, Sexual Relations and Illegitimacy in Dutch Colonial Cape Town, c. 1652-1795", "created_at": "2014-01-04T04:04:11.571-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5601598/_A_Mother_Makes_No_Bastard_Family_Law_Sexual_Relations_and_Illegitimacy_in_Dutch_Colonial_Cape_Town_c_1652_1795?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_5601598", "summary": "Many mothers in seventeenth and eighteenth-century Cape Town produced prenuptial or out-of-wedlock children.

Because of this neglect, I propose to address in this exploratory article some of the issues raised by illegitimacy and to present some of the sources that are available to historians. This I do by concentrating on the legal framework: illegitimacy is first of all a legal and not primarily a moral category. Who were the parents of illegitimate children and what sort of sexual relations resulted in their birth? How did the specific social conditions at the Cape impact on the different types of relations that existed between men and women? And, above all, how was this regulated \u2013 what was the impact of family law on the relations between parents and the status of their children? A further question \u2013 albeit one which can be dealt with less fully due to the restrictions of the archival record \u2013 is what happened to such children. Were they allowed to live? What provisions were made for them, and what was the legal impact of their status as bastards? In spite of the legal focus of this article, it must be remembered that the way in which the law was interpreted and enforced at the Cape of Good Hope was influenced by the social contexts of both early modern Europe and the society which developed here during the Dutch period.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67613483, "asset_id": 5601598, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 67613480, "asset_id": 5601598, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 67613481, "asset_id": 5601598, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 67613482, "asset_id": 5601598, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8002573, "first_name": "Gerald", "last_name": "Groenewald", "domain_name": "johannesburg", "page_name": "GeraldGroenewald", "display_name": "Gerald Groenewald", "profile_url": "https://johannesburg.academia.edu/GeraldGroenewald?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8002573/3997984/64659588/s65_gerald.groenewald.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1727, "name": "Early Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2272, "name": "Gender History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3687, "name": "Family Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_Law?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3767, "name": "Law and Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_and_Society?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4584, "name": "Single Mothers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Single_Mothers?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 6283, "name": "History of Slavery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Slavery?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 6463, "name": "History of Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Sexuality?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 7337, "name": "History of Childhood and Youth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Childhood_and_Youth?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 12958, "name": "South Africa (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Africa_History_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 15245, "name": "History of the Family", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Family?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 32159, "name": "Family history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 52690, "name": "History of Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Law?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 62138, "name": "Cape Town", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cape_Town?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 209284, "name": "Honour", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Honour?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 218722, "name": "Dutch overseas history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_overseas_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 365865, "name": "18th Century Cape of Good Hope", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/18th_Century_Cape_of_Good_Hope?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 398468, "name": "Illegitimate children", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Illegitimate_children?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 81135423, "title": "Theodorus van den Heuvel Inspects the Phramen of Queen Aphainuchit in 1738", "created_at": "2022-06-09T22:22:33.368-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/81135423/Theodorus_van_den_Heuvel_Inspects_the_Phramen_of_Queen_Aphainuchit_in_1738?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_81135423", "summary": "In 1738, the director of the Dutch trade office at Ayutthaya was invited to inspect the crematory building being prepared for one of King Borommakot\u2019s chief queens, probably an unique opportunity for a foreigner in this era; and on the following day, he witnessed the funeral procession.

The 1625 loss of Dutch Brazil made clear that the next attempt of the WIC had to be more tenacious and that its commanders needed better information about the areas that had to be seized and could be useful for trade in the West (read: Atlantic).

In recent research, empires are seen more as a collection of\n nodes than structures of a centre with peripheries. Each node can be part of\n several networks, which contribute to the shaping of that node. When applied\n to the Cape settlement this concept makes a valuable contribution to our\n understanding of Cape society and its residents. The Cape was a complex society\n in which several different groups lived together. Each of these experienced\n their environment in another manner influenced by the networks they were\n part of, and each of these made their own contribution to the shaping of\n the Cape settlement. This article focuses on the burgher group and especially\n those burghers from the middle and upper layers. These burghers were the\n ones who were mostly exposed to the many connections of the Cape with the\n Netherlands through for instance religion, education, enterprise, the justice\n system, and travel. As a result, they came to regard themselves as burghers of\n the United Netherlands who were entitled to all the rights and privileges of\n that status. The VOC administration did not agree and argued that all were\n subjects of the Company. The position on both sides of the conflict needs to\n be referenced to the larger framework of the Dutch world. As such this clash is\n a practical example of how the Cape during the Dutch period can only really\n be understood as part of a larger context which shows that the Cape, although\n perhaps unique and atypical, ultimately was part and parcel of the Dutch\n trading empire and its networks.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42270730, "asset_id": 19468637, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 304653, "first_name": "Teun", "last_name": "Baartman", "domain_name": "uct", "page_name": "TeunBaartman", "display_name": "Teun  Baartman", "profile_url": "https://uct.academia.edu/TeunBaartman?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/304653/75148/8541661/s65_teun.baartman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2089, "name": "Social Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Identity?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12958, "name": "South Africa (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Africa_History_?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 174485, "name": "Cape Colony", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cape_Colony?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 365865, "name": "18th Century Cape of Good Hope", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/18th_Century_Cape_of_Good_Hope?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 518508, "name": "Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 14021796, "title": "Exotic origins: the emblematic biogeographies of early modern scaly mammals", "created_at": "2015-07-14T02:01:56.758-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14021796/Exotic_origins_the_emblematic_biogeographies_of_early_modern_scaly_mammals?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_14021796", "summary": "Exotic natural objects brought to Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were mutable and malleable things.

The distinctions between Orient and Occident had divided the world since antiquity and were given a range of new senses in this period. The location of these two \u2018Indies\u2019, and their relationship to one another, were neither static nor always geographically defined. This article focuses on two rich examples of this natural historical construction in relation to images of the Indies: the Old World pangolin, or scaly anteater, and its New World counterpart, the armadillo. Initially, pangolins were understood as East Indian \u2018scaly lizards\u2019, armadillos as West Indian. But from the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, their geographical identities and symbolic associations were entangled as these creatures came to embody colonial anxieties and resonances. The \u2018India\u2019 of the scaly lizard became the \u2018Indies\u2019 of the scaled mammals, both East and West.

By making use of the concept of entrepreneurship and its attendant issues, the article describes Eksteen\u02bcs rise to fortune and prestige through his exploitation of a combination of economic opportunities afforded by Cape Town\u02bcs position as a port servicing passing ships. Crucial to Eksteen\u02bcs later success was his successful use of the opportunities provided by the monopolistic alcohol retail market at the Cape. Eksteen\u02bcs initial success in this arena provided him with a capital base to pursue other opportunities in agriculture, fishing and meat provision, making him the wealthiest man at the Cape by the 1730s. The article also illustrates how Eksteen\u02bcs upward mobility was linked to his use of social capital and the cultivation of large social networks through kinship. It demonstrates, furthermore, that economic success was wound up with social power and prestige. In using the biography of Eksteen, the article argues for the importance of economic history in the study of the early modern Cape, but calls also for a study which links economic developments with social and cultural ones through a focus on individual entrepreneurs. Shown, too, is the fact that the existing conception of the rise of a Cape gentry in the eighteenth century needs to be revised to take into account the role of entrepreneurship, the urban foundations

He converted in 1745 in Aachen from Judaism to Christianity, and went to Sri Lanka in 1754 to work as a preceptor of Oriental Languages at the Seminary in Colombo for the Dutch East India Company. He wrote three books in German about conversion. However he is most famous as the translator of the excerpts of the Chronicles of the Jews from Cochin, India, and the Hebrew translation of the Quran, which resides in the Library of Congress in Washington. He also allegedly possessed a manuscript called the Iggeret Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai, now in possession of The Royal Danish Library. Until now information about his life was scarcely available. This book aims to give more insights into his life, and to provide context to the aforementioned books and the manuscript. It reveals among many other things that van Dort also translated the Hebrew New Testament, residing in the Cambridge Library. \r\n\r\n- In the book the following data can be found: background of upbringing, parents and siblings, education including list of books he read, whereabouts through all the years, content and explanation of his 3 books on conversion and dates, background on his print business in Aachen, purpose of visit to Cochin, exact dates of visit to Cochin, attitude towards teaching and translations, insights into his attitudes, values, beliefs and actions.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73609443, "asset_id": 44467432, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 139177471, "first_name": "Mascha", "last_name": "van Dort", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MaschavanDort", "display_name": "Mascha van Dort", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MaschavanDort?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/139177471/38593336/37201631/s65_mascha.van_dort.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 983, "name": "Jewish Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jewish_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8908, "name": "History of The Netherlands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_The_Netherlands?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27831, "name": "18th Century", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/18th_Century?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 168297, "name": "Colonial archival records on Cochin", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_archival_records_on_Cochin?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 218722, "name": "Dutch overseas history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_overseas_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 533716, "name": "History of Germany", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Germany?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 924301, "name": "History of Ceylon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Ceylon?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 43314419, "title": "\u2018The Asian foundations of the Dutch thalassocracy; Creative absorption and the Company empire in Asia\u2019 in: Rolf Strootman, Floris van den Eijnde and Roy van Wijk eds., Empires of the sea; Maritime power networks in world history (Leiden: Brill 2019) 312-337", "created_at": "2020-06-11T04:06:47.387-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43314419/_The_Asian_foundations_of_the_Dutch_thalassocracy_Creative_absorption_and_the_Company_empire_in_Asia_in_Rolf_Strootman_Floris_van_den_Eijnde_and_Roy_van_Wijk_eds_Empires_of_the_sea_Maritime_power_networks_in_world_history_Leiden_Brill_2019_312_337?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_43314419", "summary": "This article evaluates the modes of operation of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) within the framework of empire studies.

It deals with the various branches of the Company that produced records relevant for Indian history, where these materials are presently kept, and how they are accessible.\n\nThe second part of the presentation addresses the question what can be found in the Dutch sources with respect to India. Serving as an illustration of the often surprising contents of these records, the focus lies here with court politics in the Vijayanagara successor states, ruled by Nayaka dynasties. Since the Dutch maintained close and long-lasting relations with these states, the Company archives contain numerous references to matters like succession struggles, the powers of courtiers, and court ritual. For each of these aspects, examples are discussed that show how Dutch sources contribute to our knowledge of India\u2019s past.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51445494, "asset_id": 31011472,

"summary": "This article examines Anglo\u2013Dutch rivalry in the Banda Islands in the period from 1609 to 1621, with a particular focus on the process of claiming initiated by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and English East India Company (EIC). Historians have paid little attention to the precise legal justifications employed by these organisations, and how they affected the outcome of events. For both companies, treaties with Asian rulers and peoples were essential in staking out claims to trade and territory. Because so many different parties were involved, individual documents had to serve multiple purposes, both on the ground in the East Indies and at the negotiating tables back in Europe. Whenever a VOC or EIC official presented a treaty to a Bandanese leader, he had to recognise local power structures in the Spice Islands, but also needed to consider his European competitors in the area, his superiors in Batavia or Bantam, and the company directors back in Amsterdam or London. Consequently, the safest and most reliable course of action was to make as many arguments as possible, piling them on top of one another. The result was an inherently messy process of claiming, yet one that was also clearly intelligible to most parties involved, including Asian rulers and peoples. A constantly changing legal suite extended to freedom of trade and navigation, contracts and alliances with native peoples, just war, conquest, actual possession, and the (perceived) surrender of native sovereignty to European authorities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44202317, "asset_id": 23804229, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

The focus is on Dutch demand for porcelain, which types of porcelain were ordered and what the Dutch East India Company (VOC) transported. I found that most orders were sent between 1634-1644, a relatively short period and porcelain deliveries peaked between 1638-1644. This was the result of effective Dutch demand for porcelain. The VOC plays an essential role in this process because Chinese ceramics were not only shipped to the Dutch Republic itself, but also throughout eastern and western Asia.\nFor this study, I have drawn on three distinct areas of research: maritime trade and archaeology, Chinese export ware, and the history of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). I have used maritime archaeology to analyse the types of export ceramics that were transported overseas from China. I argue that objects salvaged from shipwrecks show that during the pre-Western period of trade in Asia, ceramics were for the most part shapes intended for the Chinese domestic market, but gradually came to include items to suit the preferences of a certain region and/or clientele. \nFrom the same perspective, I have sought to demonstrate that after the arrival of the first Western merchants in Asia, the Portuguese and the Spanish, only slight adaptations such as the application of a heraldic or religious decoration were made. However, it seems that there was no mass production of shapes destined specifically for the Iberian markets. Items from the S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o (1552) and the S\u00e3o Bento (1554) shipwrecks are illustrative of porcelain available to the Portuguese in that period; these were for the most part bowls and some flatware, all regular Chinese domestic shapes. A significant change can be seen from the San Diego shipwreck of 1600, which revealed flatware with a panel-decoration not retrieved from earlier shipwrecks. In later years, this type became known as Kraak porcelain, the core subject of this dissertation.\nFrom an etymological perspective, I argue that the term carrack/ kraken was used by the English and the Dutch only to describe a specific type of North European trading vessel used from early 15th century in the North Sea regions. When people from this area were confronted with Iberian ships resembling those they were acquantied with, they used the general term for trading vessels, carracks/kraken.\n From an art-historical perspective, I conclude that the Dutch did not use the term Kraak in combination with porcelain for Chinese porcelain at the beginning of the 17th century. The combination only starts to appear regularly during the second half of the 17th century, but then with the meaning of old or antique porcelain. As has been the case regarding other export ware, Kraak is a Western label, comparable to \u2018transitional ware\u2019, famille verte, famille noire and famille rose. I suggest that the principal decorative feature, panels or cartouches, which distinguishes this type of export ware from others produced during the same period, should preferably be chosen as the reference point to describe Kraak porcelain. Terms like \u2018blue and white panel-decorated Chinese porcelain made for export\u2019, or simply, \u2018panel-decorated Kraak porcelain\u2019, \u2018Kraak-panelled porcelain\u2019, all serve the purpose. \nI have used archaeological data from Jingdezhen to illustrate that items for the domestic market were produced and fired in the same kilns as Kraak-panelled porcelain, using the same types of materials. I illustrate the shapes that are for the most part foreign to the Chinese, using the typology made for the items retrieved from the Witte Leeuw, as they represent the majority of Kraak-panelled ware. My reinterpretation of dating Kraak-panelled porcelain is to correct the idea that this type of porcelain was produced as early as 1570. This analysis is again based on shipwreck finds since these are of a fixed date, contrary to those from museum or private collections of which the provenance is uncertain.\nFrom a historical perspective, I demonstrate that Dutch demand for porcelain only gradually developed. This analysis is mainly based on VOC orders and cargo lists. Commissions were initially sent to Asia irregularly; the focus was on flatware and shallow bowls. VOC shipwrecks from 1609 and 1613 are illustrative of what was transported to the Dutch Republic. At this stage, their contents are a mixture of Kraak-panelled porcelain and Chinese domestic ware. I analyse and illustrate the quantities on cargo lists by a several table to show the fluctuation in shipments of porcelain by the VOC.\nIn 1624, the VOC established a trading post on Formosa (present-day Taiwan), which remained in operation until 1662. Historical documents such as the Dagregisters van het Kasteel Zeelandia show that ceramic shipments from China to Formosa are mostly listed generally as either \u2018coarse\u2019 or \u2018fine\u2019, without further detail. From 1634, deliveries became more constant; orders increased and contained more specific instructions as to shapes and designs, often accompanied by samples to be copied. These included Western items as beer tankards and candlestick holders, but the designs should be non-Western, Chinese figures and landscapes and no Dutch flowers. Such items have been categorized as \u2018transitional wares\u2019. I analyse, again by way of a table, that the peak in the quantities transported by the VOC occurred during a relatively short period, between 1635-1645. It is therefore not surprising that illustrations of Dutch interiors dating prior to this period do not depict large numbers of Chinese porcelain. \nThe dissertation has presented a comprehensive analysis of the history of Chinese export ceramics based on archaeological finds, combined with the art-historical aspects of one particular type, Kraak porcelain. I arrived at a sharper definition and a clearer chronology of this specific type of porcelain, the main sort produced for Europe. Dutch demand for porcelain was decisive in activating the porcelain production in China; Western shapes were in demand and quantities rose, be it only during a relative short period. However, it cannot exactly be established when these arrived in the Dutch Republic. Items from shipwrecks are helpful to show what was transported during this period. The VOC was the main company ordering and storing Chinese porcelain and distributed it within Asia, to Persia and Arabia, and to Europe during the first half of the 17th century.

The Dutch company, often called \u00abthe first multinational company in the world\u00bb, is most often studied from the perspective of business history, history of trade or maritime history. However, Philip Stern, in his recent The Company State: Corporate Sovereignty and the Early Modern Foundations of the British Empire in India, introduces a new perspective to study the Early Modern commercial companies. Instead of seeing the various chartered companies as filling \u00abstate-like\u00bb functions, he argues we should see them as states in their own right 1. Stern argues that the English East India Company, acted as a state in Asia and viewed itself as such even as early as the seventeenth century. Rather than seeing the company as a commercial entity that also fulfills some \u00abstate-like\u00bb roles, the company was a state. This state, moreover, was not constituted solely by the charter granted in England, but also by the privileges received from sovereigns in Asia, as well as the rights it had acquired in specific locations due to purchase, lease, or conquest. This has a number of important consequences for the study of the company. In the first place, we should approach the company as an organization with a political life of its own, independent from that of the mother country. In the second place, this means that we may study the companies from a political perspective, rather than from a purely commercial one. This will also allow scholars to study ideological conflicts within company ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62130595, "asset_id": 42006206, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 20890903, "first_name": "Erik", "last_name": "Odegard", "domain_name": "iisg", "page_name": "ErikOdegard", "display_name": "Erik Odegard", "profile_url": "https://iisg.academia.edu/ErikOdegard?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/20890903/6209346/86503165/s65_erik.odegard.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 137, "name": "Economic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1727, "name": "Early Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26606, "name": "17th Century Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 218722, "name": "Dutch overseas history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_overseas_history?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 40568962, "title": "Remains of Dark Days: The Architectural Heritage of Oratorian Missionary Churches in Sri Lanka", "created_at": "2019-10-09T07:06:34.086-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40568962/Remains_of_Dark_Days_The_Architectural_Heritage_of_Oratorian_Missionary_Churches_in_Sri_Lanka?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_40568962", "summary": "The book is a narrative of the turbulent, historical, cultural and artistic context of the Goan Oratorian architectural tradition, adopted to the temporal and spiritual needs of the native Catholic population of Sri Lanka, during the 18th and 19th centuries, through various form of Indo-Portuguese influences.

This chapter, however, takes a broader view of the East India companies as trading ventures and instruments of empire, especially as the building blocks for a subsequent phase of empire-building.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59229103, "asset_id": 8145977, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 26, "name": "Business", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Business?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 137, "name": "Economic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1727, "name": "Early Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2074, "name": "International Business", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Business?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 3180, "name": "International Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Trade?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 3479, "name": "Business History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Business_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 18673, "name": "Economic history/Trade history/Oriental trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_history_Trade_history_Oriental_trade?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 30010, "name": "Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Empire?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 31619, "name": "Ports and Harbours", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ports_and_Harbours?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 32014, "name": "Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trade?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 35165, "name": "History of the British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_British_Empire?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 54691, "name": "History of Commodities in a Global Perspective", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Commodities_in_a_Global_Perspective?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 159832, "name": "Commodities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commodities?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 410377, "name": "Foreign Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foreign_Trade?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 992982, "name": "Empire and Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Empire_and_Imperialism?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1173530, "name": "Chartered Companies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chartered_Companies?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1282994, "name": "Commodities Trading", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commodities_Trading?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 11586704, "title": "(ed.), Fifty years later;

Historians of the Cape of Good Hope during the VOC era have identified the development of a local elite during the eighteenth century. The Cape gentry, consisting of grain and wine farmers in the hinterland of Cape Town, consolidated their power and influence over several generations through capital accumulation in the form of land and slaves, and through contracting endogamous marriages. This article contributes to this scholarship by adding a missing dimension: urban entrepreneurs in the form of the alcohol pachters (lease-holders). It traces how kinship, entrepreneurship and social capital were used by these people to gain economic advancement, and how the use of these factors changed over time. The article argues that the 1770s present a change-over from an earlier era when alcohol entrepreneurs were largely immigrant-based and used their cultural identities to their  advantage, to a system where the urban and rural elites increasingly contracted business and social alliances. As such this study argues that the foundations of the Cape gentry lay in more than the accumulation of land and slaves. The  entrepreneurial activities of alcohol pachters in Cape Town and their increasing alliances with the rural elite played an important role in creating an intricate network of wealthy and influential elite families at the Cape of Good Hope by the end of the eighteenth century.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60621767, "asset_id": 8870662, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8002573, "first_name": "Gerald", "last_name": "Groenewald", "domain_name": "johannesburg", "page_name": "GeraldGroenewald", "display_name": "Gerald Groenewald", "profile_url": "https://johannesburg.academia.edu/GeraldGroenewald?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8002573/3997984/64659588/s65_gerald.groenewald.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 27, "name": "Entrepreneurship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Entrepreneurship?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3479, "name": "Business History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Business_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5745, "name": "Social Capital", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Capital?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6761, "name": "Prosopography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prosopography?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8577, "name": "Social Stratification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Stratification?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 12958, "name": "South Africa (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Africa_History_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 13775, "name": "History of Elites", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Elites?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 62138, "name": "Cape Town", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cape_Town?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 218722, "name": "Dutch overseas history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_overseas_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 365865, "name": "18th Century Cape of Good Hope", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/18th_Century_Cape_of_Good_Hope?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 8018427, "title": "Slaves and Free Blacks in VOC Cape Town, 1652\u20131795", "created_at": "2014-08-18T22:52:54.786-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8018427/Slaves_and_Free_Blacks_in_VOC_Cape_Town_1652_1795?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_8018427", "summary": "During the past three decades, historians of the Cape Colony during the period of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) rule have transformed our view of the role of slavery. Slavery has moved from an issue of marginal importance to one which is now considered central to the establishment and growth of a colonial society in South Africa. Most of this work, however, focused on the agrarian areas of the colony, and there has, until recently, been relatively little attempt to plumb the uniqueness of the experience of slaves and free blacks in VOC Cape Town. This topic deserves interest because of the cosmopolitan nature of the urban environment and its links with the wider world of the Indian Ocean. This article is a synthesis of the most important recent research on the experience of slaves and free blacks in Cape Town. It shows that although there is general agreement about the origins and development of slavery, its demographic nature and its economic significance, Cape historians have yet to fully utilise the available sources to trace the cultural and social history of urban slavery.

Si trattava di una nave carica d\u2019artiglieria, munizioni e polvere da sparo, con a bordo un equipaggio di k\u014dm\u014djin (lett. \u2018gente dai peli rossi\u2019) secondo la definizione poi corrente in Asia orientale. Alcuni anni dopo, nell\u2019agosto 1609, Tokugawa Ieyasu (1542-1616) \u2013 gi\u00e0 sh\u014dgun in ritiro, ma padrone de facto del Giappone \u2013 concesse i primi \u2018lasciapassare\u2019 alle navi della Compagnia olandese delle Indie orientali (1602-1795). Nel porto di Hirado si sarebbe inaugurata la prima base commerciale olandese, e accanto ad essa, nel 1613, vi si insedi\u00f2 anche la filiale di un\u2019altra potente organizzazione per i traffici con l\u2019oltremare, l\u2019East India Company (1600-1858). Subentrando con forza alle grandi potenze mercantili iberiche sulle rotte dell\u2019est-Asia, le marinerie del nord Europa ne insidiarono il primato nell\u2019area, inserendosi inoltre in quel lungo processo di trasferimento di tecnologie e conoscenze scientifiche occidentali, gi\u00e0 avviato nel Cinquecento dai mercanti iberici e dai missionari cattolici. Per il Giappone si apriva una lunga ed inattesa pagina non soltanto delle relazioni diplomatico-commerciali con nuovi interlocutori europei, ma anche degli scambi culturali, scientifici ed artistici \u2013 coltivati nel Settecento in particolar modo dai rangakusha, i \u2018cultori di studi olandesi\u2019 \u2013 che anticiparono il dialogo e la cooperazione con l\u2019Occidente, avviato dal secolo XIX in poi.\r\n\r\nIndice:\r\nIntroduzione: empori, rotte e traffici in Asia orientale prima delle Compagnie\r\n1. Un triangolo navigato: Cina-Corea-Giappone\r\n2. Tanegashima, kirishitan e naus da prata: mercanti iberici alla riscossa\r\n3. Amacon, un ponte tra la Cina e il Giappone\r\n4. Il bakufu e i traffici con l\u2019oltremare: il ritorno delle shuinsen\r\nI. L\u2019arrivo dei primi k\u014dm\u014djin\r\n1. I superstiti del Liefde sbarcano nel Ky\u016bsh\u016b (1600)\r\n2.

This comparison will allow me to cast new light on Woodburn\u2019s argument that the the origin of social inequality in immediate-return hunter-gatherer societies may lie in the appropriation of the religious domain by senior men.  \r\nIn the first part of the paper, I argue that the Makassar and the Buid formed part of a single regional system in which coastal societies preyed on the members of autonomous tribal societies practicing shifting cultivation in the highlands.  The depredations of the hierarchical coastal societies spawned an ethic in the highlands in which equality, autonomy and communal solidarity were valued above all else.  But even within the coastal societies, the lower orders often developed a set of religious values similar to those of the highlanders, values that rejected the hierarchy, dependency and factionalism of the elite.  This rejection was expressed through popular interpretations of world religions like Islam and Christianity.  Historically, religions promising spiritual salvation from social bondage often arose in the most hierarchical social orders.  I argue that hierarchy and equality, dependency and autonomy, solidarity and factionalism should all be viewed as conceptual oppositions that develop in tandem with one another, much like the concepts of \u201cfree gift\u201d and \u201ccommodity\u201d (Parry, 1986).\r\n\r\nIn the second part of the paper, I approach popular ideas of salvation among the Makassar through an analysis of the epic of Datu Museng.  In reciting this epic, Makassar bards simultaneously recall their experience of Dutch colonialism, express a mystical vision of life as a quest to transcend the social order and reunite with God, and rework a pervasive precoccupation of Austronesian mythology, the fate of opposite-sex twins.  They also reveal a profound ambivalence toward the values of equality and hierarchy, autonomy and dependency, solidarity and factionalism. It is only because Makassar society was based on hereditary ranks, slavery and warfare that Makassar religion could develop such a clear ideal of the wandering saint who transcends all worldly spatial, temporal and categorical boundaries.  \r\n\r\nIn the third part of the paper, I compare the salvation Islamic saints promise the Makassar with the salvation Jesus Christ promises lowland Filipinos.  In both cases, the lower orders in a hierarchical society can appeal to the transcendental values of a global religion to circumscribe the power of the local spirits and political elites.  I contrast this situation with that of the Buid and the immediate-return hunter-gatherers discussed by Woodburn.  In these egalitarian societies, the major threat to society comes not from elites who abuse their power but from individuals who place their own autonomy above the needs of the group.  Religious rituals are used to assert the primacy of communal solidarity over individual autonomy.    The seeds of inequality lie in a widespread tendency to map the opposition between communal and individual interest onto the opposition between male and female, allowing senior men to assert a monopoly of control over collective ritual.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31089558, "asset_id": 3158477, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 519466, "first_name": "Thomas", "last_name": "Gibson", "domain_name": "rochester", "page_name": "ThomasGibson", "display_name": "Thomas  Gibson", "profile_url": "https://rochester.academia.edu/ThomasGibson?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/519466/182474/212683/s65_thomas.gibson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7540, "name": "Oral Traditions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oral_Traditions?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30571, "name": "Islamic Mysticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Mysticism?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68203, "name": "Bugis-Makassar Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bugis-Makassar_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 3158484, "title": "2008 From stranger king to stranger shaikh: Austronesian symbolism and Islamic knowledge", "created_at": "2013-03-29T13:04:00.566-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3158484/2008_From_stranger_king_to_stranger_shaikh_Austronesian_symbolism_and_Islamic_knowledge?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_3158484", "summary": "Three political institutions came into being successively in Southeast Asia and co-existed for several centuries: stranger-kingship, cosmopolitan law and bureaucratic rationality. Each was based on a different set of practices, and each served to estrange political authorities from their subjects. Firstly, cosmological rituals placed the stranger-king above the factional loyalties of his subjects. Secondly, cosmopolitan legal codes and mystical practices derived from Islamic scriptures placed the ulama and shaikh above the elders who enforced local customs \u2013 and, in times of crisis, even above the local king. Thirdly, impersonal bureaucratic procedures and access to an archive of documents placed the officers of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and of the colonial state above the \u2018natives\u2019. This paper argues that all three institutions be seen as a symbolic expression of a general requirement for the existence of ordered social life, namely the need for institutions that can rise above the conflicts and factionalism generated by everyday events. It traces the process by which the traditional authority of stranger-kings in south Sulawesi was complemented and contradicted after 1605 by the charismatic authority of Islamic shaikhs, and by the bureaucratic authority of Dutch officials.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31089548, "asset_id": 3158484, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 519466, "first_name": "Thomas", "last_name": "Gibson", "domain_name": "rochester", "page_name": "ThomasGibson", "display_name": "Thomas  Gibson", "profile_url": "https://rochester.academia.edu/ThomasGibson?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/519466/182474/212683/s65_thomas.gibson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 899, "name": "Legitimacy and Authority", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Legitimacy_and_Authority?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68203, "name": "Bugis-Makassar Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bugis-Makassar_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 204034, "name": "Sacred and divine kingship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sacred_and_divine_kingship?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 45618066, "title": "Tard\u00edos amores insulindios: Manila y el sultanato de Macasar en el siglo XVII / Insulindian Late Loves: Manila and the Sultanate of Makassar in the 17th Century", "created_at": "2021-03-26T04:32:52.265-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45618066/Tard%C3%ADos_amores_insulindios_Manila_y_el_sultanato_de_Macasar_en_el_siglo_XVII_Insulindian_Late_Loves_Manila_and_the_Sultanate_of_Makassar_in_the_17th_Century?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_45618066", "summary": "Resumen\nEste art\u00edculo tiene como objetivo estudiar la relaci\u00f3n que entablaron las Filipinas con el sultanato\nde Macasar, en articulaci\u00f3n con el sector mercantil portugu\u00e9s, durante el siglo xvii.

After a war between the Nayakas of Thanjavur & Madurai, the former was killed, and thereafter, Thanjavur was quickly seized by Ekoji, an Adilshahi general, who was also the half brother of Shivaji. Thus the Thanjavur Maratha dynasty was born. The Maratha monarchs of Thanjavur and their officials issued 7 kauls 1 to VOC i.e. Dutch East India Company during 1676-91, which provide us varied and detailed information about the nature and extent of the operations of VOC in Koromandel region, along with its relations with the Thanjavur Kings. During this time, at least two armed conflicts between the VOC and Thanjavur Maratha Kingdom took place. The reason behind choosing the year 1690-91 as the limit is that the year is significant for both VOC as well as Thanjavur Marathas-the former saw its headquarters shifted & the latter had to face Mughal invasion & pay tribute to Mughals. Despite the importance of both VOC & Thanjavur Marathas Kingdom in the political & economic History of the Koromandel coast, their relations with each other have never been explored in detail till date.

"work_60663751", "summary": "Ocean-going ships were key to rising maritime economies of the Early Modern period, and understanding how they were built is critical to grasp the challenges faced by shipwrights and merchant seafarers. Shipwreck timbers hold material evidence of the dynamic interplay of wood supplies, craftmanship, and evolving ship designs that helped shape the Early Modern world. Here we present the results of dendroarchaeological research carried out on Batavia's wreck timbers, currently on display at the Western Australian Shipwrecks Museum in Fremantle. Built in Amsterdam in 1628 CE and wrecked on its maiden voyage in June 1629 CE in Western Australian waters, Batavia epitomises Dutch East India Company (Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC) shipbuilding. In the 17th century, the VOC grew to become the first multinational trading enterprise, prompting the rise of the stock market and modern capitalism. Oak (Quercus sp.) was the preferred material for shipbuilding in northern and western Europe, and maritime nations struggled to ensure sufficient supplies to meet their needs and sustain their ever-growing mercantile fleets and networks. Our research illustrates the compatibility of dendrochronological studies with musealisation of shipwreck assemblages, and the results demonstrate that the VOC successfully coped with timber shortages in the early 17th century through diversification of timber sources (mainly Baltic region, L\u00fc beck hinterland in northern Germany, and Lower Saxony in northwest Germany), allocation of sourcing regions to specific timber products (hull planks from the Baltic and L\u00fc beck, framing elements from Lower Saxony), and skillful woodworking craftmanship (sapwood was removed from all timber elements).

De doelstelling van haar studie is om te achterhalen hoe en wanneer het dominante beeld ontstond van 'de' Nederlander als handelaar. Sturkenboom laat dit (zelf)beeld samenvallen met de bloei van de Republiek. Ze analyseert deze vorm van identiteitsbeleving expliciet vanuit een genderperspectief en koppelt de ontluikende koopmansidentiteit nadrukkelijk aan vroegmoderne mannelijkheidsidealen binnen en buiten de Republiek. Zich baserend op rijk en gevarieerd bronnenmateriaal, gaande van reisverslagen, koopmanshandboeken, tot humanistische traktaten, theaterstukken en encyclopedie\u00ebn geschreven door Verlichtingsdenkers, biedt Sturkenboom de lezer een systematisch overzicht in vijf uitgebreide hoofdstukken die elk een ander aspect van de 'mannelijke' koopmansidentiteit belichten. Het eerste hoofdstuk biedt een theoretisch kader voor de studie naar identiteiten en geeft de lezer houvast bij de rest van het boek. Identiteitsvorming is volgens Sturkenboom geen rechtlijnig parcours. Dit sociologisch proces verloopt doorgaans doordat we ons expliciet afzetten tegen 'de ander' en een wensbeeld van onszelf als groep ophangen. Hierdoor sluit het bronnenmateriaal dat Sturkenboom gebruikte vaak de ogen voor overduidelijke contradicties binnen de groep die zich een bepaalde identiteit wenst eigen te maken, zoals ze zelf ook aangeeft. In het tweede hoofdstuk staat een van die tegenstrijdigheden binnen het mannelijkheidsideaal van de Nederlandse koopman meteen centraal. Sturkenboom confronteert de geroemde krijgshaftigheid van de ontluikende Republiek met het zogenaamd 'zachte' handelsinstinct van de koopman, die om redenen van profijt liever gewelddadige confrontaties vermijdt. Het derde hoofdstuk behandelt mannelijkheid vanuit de strijd om de broek: hoe blijft het beeld van de koopman als ideale man overeind in een regio waar ook vrouwen zelfstandig handelsactiviteiten konden ontplooien? Ook in hoofdstuk vier toont Sturkenboom aan dat mannelijkheid nooit op zichzelf staat maar altijd in relatie met andere (gender)identiteiten vormgegeven wordt. In dit deel confronteert zij de Nederlandse handelsmentaliteit met contemporaine visies van buitenlandse Verlichtingsdenkers op slavernij en kolonialisme. Tot slot bespreekt Sturkenboom in hoofdstuk vijf hoe buitenlandse auteurs het ideaalbeeld van de eerlijke en onderlegde koopman", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65095057, "asset_id": 44626041, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2815387, "first_name": "Jonas", "last_name": "Roelens", "domain_name": "ugent", "page_name": "JonasRoelens", "display_name": "Jonas Roelens", "profile_url": "https://ugent.academia.edu/JonasRoelens?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2815387/934020/37064911/s65_jonas.roelens.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 137, "name": "Economic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1727, "name": "Early Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2272, "name": "Gender History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2865, "name": "Masculinity Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Masculinity_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26606, "name": "17th Century Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 39223294, "title": "Electronic critical edition of Hugo Grotius' Law of Prize and Booty / De Iure Praedae Commentarius (IPC) as preserved in the single extant manuscript, Leiden UL, BPL 917 \r\n\r\nURL: http://arkyves.org/view/DeIurePraedae", "created_at": "2019-05-22T03:52:52.936-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39223294/Electronic_critical_edition_of_Hugo_Grotius_Law_of_Prize_and_Booty_De_Iure_Praedae_Commentarius_IPC_as_preserved_in_the_single_extant_manuscript_Leiden_UL_BPL_917_URL_http_arkyves_org_view_DeIurePraedae?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_39223294", "summary": "Hugo Grotius (1583-1645) wrote the text of 'De Iure Praedae Commentarius' or 'De Indis' between September 1604 and November 1606 at the request of the directors of the Dutch East India Company, the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC), who (apparently) foresaw the need for a further defence of the taking of the Portuguese vessel Santa Catarina in the Strait of Malacca by their captain Jacob van Heemskerk in February 1603. The Admiralty of Amsterdam had declared the ship legitimate booty in September 1604, just prior to the VOC directors' request to Grotius to write a defence. The exact intentions and intended audience of IPC are not known, although various hypotheses have been put forward.\nJudging by its appearance, the manuscript BPL 917 seems originally to have been a 'fair copy' intended for example for circulation among persons involved with the issue at stake, or for a typesetter to print the work from. However, the work remained unpublished after completion. Grotius subsequently made many changes in the text, which are written in the manuscript in the form of deleted text, and words and passages added in margins or between lines. It seems likely that this process continued for many years. However one part of IPC was actually published: chapter 12 appeared separately as De Mari Libero ('The Free Sea', also known as Mare Liberum) in 1609.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59357158,

Currently, people live in a society with all the technological sophistication at our disposal to reach the breadth of daily interactions, starting with taking every photo of a cup of coffee. If the coffee consumer turns to the black drink that fills the cup within a minute, the coffee consumer might ask about the coffee origins. But unfortunately, the coffee consumer did not have time to jolt his mind to that one question. The sweetness of specialty coffee has passed its past, forgetting the audience from the bitter history of coffee at the time of the advancement of coffee civilisation in today's modernist community. Meanwhile, people welcome the \"third wave\" coffee culture generation, which describes a generational culture that gives a higher culinary appreciation to coffee and all that is related to it and requires: focus on the intricacies of taste, origin, and process (Colonna-Dashwood, 2017). Moreover, it's perhaps too rare to feel the classic beauty of the cafe room design on the corner of Surabaya street, or the grandeur of the cafe in a luxury mall area in South Jakarta, or the unique colonialism design in Jakarta's historical?

The paper proposes that Indian indentureship is intimately tied to the opium trade and the East India Company, as impoverished Indians were essentially economic refugees, trafficked to the plantations of Mauritius, Guyana, Trinidad, Fiji, South Africa, and up and down the Caribbean in the aftermath of slavery. This human trafficking was also organized by the rapacious East India Company. Indentureship is also tied to the destruction of the historically central East India Company by its own Sepoys in the 19th century, and also to the beginning of the global decolonisation movement by the Indian nationalist movement in the 20th century.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 75534230, "asset_id": 62929582, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8319598, "first_name": "Kirk", "last_name": "Meighoo", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "KirkMeighoo", "display_name": "Kirk Meighoo", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/KirkMeighoo?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8319598/4514052/5889183/s65_kirk.meighoo.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6541, "name": "World History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13144, "name": "Indian Diaspora (Migration and Ethnicity)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Diaspora_Migration_and_Ethnicity_?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15696, "name": "Indian nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_nationalism?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18970, "name": "British Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperialism?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21011, "name": "Guyana", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Guyana?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 33833, "name": "History of Colonial India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Colonial_India?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 36172, "name": "Amitav Ghosh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amitav_Ghosh?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 39492, "name": "Decolonisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonisation?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 53334, "name": "Indian Indenture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Indenture?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 58559, "name": "East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 69219, "name": "Mauritius", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mauritius?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 75814, "name": "Indian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 80993, "name": "Eurocentrism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eurocentrism?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 95431, "name": "Indian Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Diaspora?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 137967, "name": "Trinidad and Tobago", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trinidad_and_Tobago?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 283936, "name": "History of Indian Mutiny 1857", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Indian_Mutiny_1857?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 630381, "name": "World Development and World History According to Andre Gunder Frank", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Development_and_World_History_According_to_Andre_Gunder_Frank?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 668994, "name": "Indian Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1019273, "name": "Colonialism and Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism_and_Imperialism?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 50823771, "title": "Chinese Tea Exports via Taiwan by VOC (1641-1660): A Prelude to European Tea Consumption in 18 th Century", "created_at": "2021-08-10T20:28:19.319-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/50823771/Chinese_Tea_Exports_via_Taiwan_by_VOC_1641_1660_A_Prelude_to_European_Tea_Consumption_in_18_th_Century?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_50823771", "summary": "Tea, an exotic drink from China, was first introduced to the Europeans in the 16th century, but its consumption became more widespread only after mid-18th century. Scholars have attributed the sudden surge in tea consumption to urbanization and rise of the middle class in early-modern Europe. While Dutch, English and Portuguese residents in Asia had become very accustomed to drinking tea throughout the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and English East India Company (EIC) carried it as a profitable commodity and imported regular supplies to the homeland only after the 1680s. In mid-17th century, tea gradually began to appear on cargo manifests of VOC and EIC ships, but it was for sale to India and Persia, especially Surat (west coast of India). Consequent to the downfall of Ming dynasty and rise of Qing rule between 1644 and 1683, which disrupted the tea trade route on China's western borders, Persians who used to purchase tea from Mongolian traders in Central Asia sought alternative supplies by sea route. The VOC, which then occupied Taiwan and built close ties with Chinese traders in Fujian, responded rapidly to this call until it lost Taiwan in 1662. This article examines the Taiwan-India tea trade from c. 1641 to 1660, in particular the ways tea was prepared and consumed by Chinese, Indians, Persians and Europeans on the maritime tea route, before the sudden upsurge in tea-drinking in Europe. The author argues that their daily engagement in teadrinking parties on official and private occasions in cross-cultural settlements in Tayouan, Batavia, Bantam, Ayutthaya (central Thailand), and Surat, enabled VOC and EIC personnel to develop a tea-drinking habit, especially a taste for sugared tea. Such might have arisen from the cross-cultural encounters along the maritime tea route. Although the sugared tea was served only on special festive occasions in Fujian, the Muslim communities throughout the Southeast Asia, India and Persia were accustomed to taking tea with sweets or preserves.

This made the mount a historical and cultural symbol in the heart of the Han Chinese. Few people could imagine that the Portuguese, Spaniards and Dutch had reached China Sea and competed to win a commercial port at this mount in three hundred years.\n        After the Portuguese were allowed to reside in Macao, they kept moving about among Guangdong islands and harbors. The Pinhal had become their important porto da veniaga, or port of trade. Catholic rituals were operated by Jesuits in Pinhal, which were regarded as blasphemous conducts to the Quanjie and Dazhong Temples and the Chinese faith. The Portuguese also purchased Chinese children for religious purposes. All these pushed Lin Huichun, the magistrate of Xinhui, to adopt military actions against the Portuguese of Pinhal, and expelled them in 1569. The fact that Portuguese merchants could reside in Pinhal illustrated Guangdong authorities' weak control of neighboring islands. Obviously it offered some opportunities to the the followers, such as the Spaniards and the Dutch.\n        At the end of 1598, the Spanish captain Don Juan Zamudio was authorized to anchor and merchandise temporarily in the port of Pinhal. Not long after, another Spanish captain Luis P\u00e9rez das Mari\ue570as was also allowed to enter the port. With this, the Portuguese of Macao were anxious that the Spaniards would imitate their tricks and probably be allowed to reside in Pinhal just like them in Macao. In this case, military conflicts broke out between them, and ended with Luis P\u00e9rez das Mari\ue570as' evacuating at the beginning of 1600.\n        In the next year, the valiant Dutch followed the Spaniards closely and participated in this combat of Pinhal. In September 1601, a Dutch fleet commanded by Captain J\u00e1quez Van Neck attempted to reach the so called Pinal. However, owing to their ignorance of the Guangdong coastal regions, the Dutch reached Macao instead of Pinhal. The Portuguese had learned a lesson from the precedent incident of 1598-1600. They hastily executed seventeen Dutch sailors in case the Chinese government might extradite them. On the other hand, although there were different opinions inside the Guangdong government, Dai Yao the Governor-General of Guangdong & Guangxi adopted the policy of \u2033using one barbarian against the other\u2033 and remained neutral on the surface. J\u00e1quez Van Neck had to leave China Sea after failing to rescue his countrymen.\n        The pullout from Pinhal turned the attention of the Spaniards and the Dutch to Taiwan. In 1622, when the Dutch intercepted several Spanish documents, they discovered that the Spaniards of Manila were planning to construct a fortress in Taiwan. Thereby, they made decisions to take preemptive actions and succeed in constructing the Kasteel Zeelandia in 1624. The Spaniards built the fort San Salvador in Quelung two years later. Since then, the contention of the three forces transferred from Pinhal to the Island of Taiwan, and the former dismal and remote Taiwan began to play a significant role in the global economy and politics.\n1279\u5e74\u5b8b\u5143\u519b\u961f\u6700\u540e\u7684\u6fc0\u6218\u4ee5\u53ca\u5357\u5b8b\u738b\u671d\u7684\u8986\u4ea1\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5d16\u5c71\u6210\u4e3a\u6781\u5177\u8c61\u5f81\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u5316\u7b26\u53f7\u3002\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u6709\u4eba\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u767e\u4f59\u5e74\u540e\u7684\u660e\u4ee3\u665a\u671f\uff0c\u8461\u8404\u7259\u4eba\u3001\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u4eba\u548c\u8377\u5170\u4eba\u76f8\u7ee7\u62b5\u8fbe\u8fd9\u91cc\u5e76\u5c55\u5f00\u6fc0\u70c8\u7ade\u4e89\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u665a\u660e\u671d\u5ef7\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c\u8d25\u7ed9\u6fb3\u95e8\u8461\u4eba\u7684\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u4eba\u548c\u8377\u5170\u4eba\u624d\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u8f6c\u8d8b\u6211\u56fd\u53f0\u6e7e\u5730\u533a\u3002\u897f\u65b9\u8bf8\u56fd\u5728\u5d16\u5c71\u7684\u6e2f\u53e3\u4e4b\u4e89\u548c\u665a\u660e\u5730\u65b9\u653f\u5e9c\u7684\u76f8\u5e94\u4e3e\u63aa\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53cd\u6620\u51fa\u5927\u822a\u6d77\u65f6\u4ee3\u56fd\u9645\u5f62\u52bf\u7684\u98ce\u4e91\u53d8\u5e7b\uff0c\u4ea6\u6298\u5c04\u51fa\u665a\u660e\u671d\u5ef7\u56e0\u5faa\u5b88\u65e7\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9884\u793a\u4e86\u201c\u8001\u5927\u5e1d\u56fd\u201d\u6b64\u540e\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002",

Ranging across global contexts including the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans as well as the Caribbean, Andaman, and South China Seas, and exploring the actions of sailors, laborers, convicts, and slaves, this collection offers a fresh, sea-centered way of seeing the confluence between space, agency, and political economy during this crucial period. In this introduction we contend that the radicalism of the age of revolution can best be viewed as a geographically connected process, and that the maritime world was central to its multiple eruptions and global character. Mutiny therefore can be seen as part of something bigger and broader: what we have chosen to call maritime radicalism, a term as well as a concept that has had virtually no presence in the literature on the revolutiona...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73330745, "asset_id": 59375436, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 58821256, "first_name": "Hamish", "last_name": "Maxwell-Stewart", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HMaxwellStewart", "display_name": "Hamish Maxwell-Stewart", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HMaxwellStewart?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/58821256/43023562/34327042/s65_hamish.maxwell-stewart.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4121, "name": "Atlantic World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atlantic_World?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4409, "name": "Naval History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Naval_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4652, "name": "French Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_Revolution?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6888, "name": "Indian Ocean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 15573, "name": "American Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Revolution?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 27533, "name": "Atlantic history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atlantic_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 29329, "name": "Mutiny and Military Unrest", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mutiny_and_Military_Unrest?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 49917, "name": "Dutch History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 62138, "name": "Cape Town", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cape_Town?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 66183, "name": "Britain and French Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Britain_and_French_Revolution?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 184047, "name": "New South Wales", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_South_Wales?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 186703, "name": "Convict Transportation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convict_Transportation?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 202979, "name": "Amistad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amistad?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 257992, "name": "Historical Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Studies?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 405669, "name": "Cura\u00e7ao", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cura%C3%A7ao?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 642554, "name": "Atlantic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atlantic_History-18?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 53312963, "title": "Securing the emperor, securitising the guns: the strangely delayed dissemination of Ottoman military technology in the late Ming empire", "created_at": "2021-09-25T02:56:28.415-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/53312963/Securing_the_emperor_securitising_the_guns_the_strangely_delayed_dissemination_of_Ottoman_military_technology_in_the_late_Ming_empire?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_53312963", "summary": "This article analyses the reasons behind the delayed appropriation and adoption of Ottoman harquebuses by the Ming army. Although these weapons had reached the empire by the mid-16th century, their existence was only acknowledged at the end of the century. Through the lens of securitisation, I will argue that this delay was a result of the context of Luso-Ottoman geopolitical rivalries in which these weapons were possibly leveraged as an incentive to form a Sino-Ottoman alliance against the Portuguese. I will argue that a civil bureaucracy averse to assertive activist rulership could have prevented the emperor from participating in the resulting military diplomacy. By comparing this event with a later Dutch East India Company embassy with similar geopolitical intentions, I will argue that the Ming civil officials achieved their goal by controlling the emperor's perception of Ottoman intentions. In terms of securitisation, this meant that the emperor himself was the main audience and his officials the securitising agents in matters of foreign relations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 70213279, "asset_id": 53312963, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4664899, "first_name": "Barend", "last_name": "Noordam", "domain_name": "uab", "page_name": "BarendNoordam", "display_name": "Barend Noordam", "profile_url": "https://uab.academia.edu/BarendNoordam?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4664899/1959365/2316200/s65_barend.noordam.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 133, "name": "Military History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 138, "name": "Diplomatic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomatic_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11208, "name": "Ottoman Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ottoman_Empire?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12746, "name": "Ming Dynasty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ming_Dynasty?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19609, "name": "History of Military Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Military_Technology?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 20433, "name": "History of the Portuguese Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Portuguese_Empire?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 299258, "name": "Jesuits in China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jesuits_in_China?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 313371, "name": "Diplomacy and international relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomacy_and_international_relations?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 45103804, "title": "Grotius and the East Indies", "created_at": "2021-02-11T18:14:47.787-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45103804/Grotius_and_the_East_Indies?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_45103804", "summary": "The present chapter explores what Grotius came to know about trade,\ndiplomacy and politics in the East Indies.

focuses on a set of events in the Aru Islands, Maluku, in the late eighteenth century which are documented in some detail by Dutch records. A violent rebellion with Muslim and anti-European overtones baffled the Dutch colonialists (VOC) and led to a series of humiliations for the Company on Aru, before eventually being subdued. As one of the main catalysts of the conflict stands the chief Tamalola from the Muslim island Ujir. Interestingly, this person is also a central figure in local traditions from Ujir. Moreover, his story connects with wider cultural and economic networks in eastern Indonesia. Thus the article asks how the imprints of the Tamalola figure in textual and non-textual sources can add to our knowledge of how communities of Eastern Indonesia ordered their lives outside colonial control.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61137334, "asset_id": 40851668, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 973182, "first_name": "Emilie",

We consider the extent to which military Asian influence on the Portuguese in Asia in the 16th Century made them militarily inferior to European enemies like the Dutch in the 17th Century. It will be argued that it did so only in a limited way that does not corroborate claims for an extensive Early Modern Western military exceptionalism.\n\nEste artigo pretende relacionar a guerra naval luso-neerlandesa na \u00c1sia no s\u00e9culo XVII com o tema da revolu\u00e7\u00e3o militar, designadamente na discuss\u00e3o que tem gerado sobre a exist\u00eancia ou n\u00e3o de uma excepcionalidade militar ocidental no per\u00edodo moderno que teria superiorizado decisivamente ocidentais em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a n\u00e3o-europeus. O tema \u00e9 abordado considerando ate\u0301que ponto a influ\u00eancia militar asi\u00e1tica sobre os portugueses no s\u00e9culo XVI os inferiorizou depois em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a oponentes europeus como os neerlandeses no s\u00e9culo XVII. Alegar-se-a\u0301 que o fez apenas limitadamente, n\u00e3o chegando por isso para corroborar por extens\u00e3o as reivindica\u00e7\u00f5es de uma excepcionalidade militar ocidental taxativa e decisiva.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59009050, "asset_id": 38909828, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2549092, "first_name": "Andr\u00e9", "last_name": "Murteira", "domain_name": "fcsh-unl", "page_name": "Andr\u00e9Murteira", "display_name": "Andr\u00e9 Murteira", "profile_url": "https://fcsh-unl.academia.edu/Andr%C3%A9Murteira?f_ri=65822", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4537, "name": "Early Modern Portuguese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Portuguese_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20433, "name": "History of the Portuguese Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Portuguese_Empire?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37092215, "title": "\u2018The Indian Ocean in the Long Eighteenth Century\u2019, Eighteenth-Century Studies, 47/4 (2014), pp. 1-19.

After 1637, a new set of investigations on the coast of Xinzhu and Xiao Liuqiu water were initiated for settling a new course cross Taiwan strait. The Spaniards were defeated in Jilong in 1642, it led to an examining on the coast of Xinzhu and Miaoli. When the VOC resumed its blockade on Manila, vessels were assigned to Luzon passing by Xiao Liuqiu. During reoccupation of Jilong 1664-1668, the VOC vessels sailed around Northern Fujian and Zhejian province and sailed south on the east coast of Taiwan. The VOC mariners had surveyed all waters around Taiwan and pinned the terminal points when sailing from Taiwan to other shores. Most of those points were still functioning under the later Qing court.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68957186, "asset_id": 50823710, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2644935, "first_name": "Weichung", "last_name": "Cheng", "domain_name": "sinica", "page_name": "httpwwwithsinicaedutwmembers_02_lookphpno473page1", "display_name": "Weichung Cheng", "profile_url": "https://sinica.academia.edu/httpwwwithsinicaedutwmembers_02_lookphpno473page1?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2644935/842543/6972408/s65_skipio.formosanus.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1727, "name": "Early Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15658, "name": "History of Taiwan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Taiwan?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26630, "name": "Age of Sail", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Age_of_Sail?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 79022, "name": "Sea Routes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sea_Routes?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 648975, "name": "Trade Routes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trade_Routes?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1195930, "name": "Hydrographic Surveying", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hydrographic_Surveying?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 3117512, "name": "Nautical Charts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nautical_Charts?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 49060804, "title": "VERMEER'S SIGNATURE on a ca. 1665 map of NEW NETHERLAND based on Dutch explorer Adriaen Block's 1614 voyage. 2021", "created_at": "2021-05-28T09:42:01.313-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49060804/VERMEERS_SIGNATURE_on_a_ca_1665_map_of_NEW_NETHERLAND_based_on_Dutch_explorer_Adriaen_Blocks_1614_voyage_2021?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_49060804", "summary": "Vermeer was an architectural image maker and a map maker.

So berichteten Jesuiten schon Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts aus Japan ueber die Moxibustion. Allerdings blieben diese Informationen sehr sporadisch und waren ueber verschiedene Textarten verstreut, so dass es in Europa zu keiner nennenswerten Reaktion kam. Mit dem 1675 publizierten Buch des batavischen Pfarrers Hermann Buschoff jedoch setzt eine nachhaltige Debatte ueber diese Brenntherapie ein. Buschoffs Namen finden wir im Zusammenhang mit der Einfuehrung des Begriffes \"Moxa\" in vielen Arbeiten zur Vermittlung der ostasiatischen Medizin nach Europa, doch war bis in die juengste Vergangenheit fast nichts ueber dessen Leben und Werk bekannt. Buschoff, der etwa 1620 in Utrecht geboren wurde, zog 1654 als Pfarrer im Dienste der VOC nach Ostasien, wo man ihn zunaechst auf Taiwan, spaeter in Batavia einsetzte. Er litt u. a. an Podagra. Dieses Leiden wurde gegen Ende der fuenziger Jahre so virulent, dass er, nachdem die europaeischen Aerzte nicht mehr helfen konnten, eine Aerztin aus dem vietnamesischen Raum um Beistand bat. Diese setzte einige Moxa-Kegelchen auf und bewirkte binnen kurzem eine erstaunliche Besserung. Nach dieser dramatischen Erfahrung widmete sich Buschoff der Erforschung der Fussgicht und der wundersamen Moxa. Schliesslich verfasste er eine den \"Bewindhebbern\" der VOC gewidmete Schrift, die sein Sohn in die Niederlande mitnahm. Zum Zeitpunkt der Publikation allerdings war der Autor schon verstorben. Buschoffs Schrift beruht auf intensiven Studien europaeischer Autoren. Sie zeigt zugleich starke Einfluesse der chinesischen Medizin. Die \"aufgestauten, boesartigen Daempfe\" als Ursache der Gicht haben ihre Wurzel im ostasiatischen Konzept des \"Qi\". Die Abfuehrung der \"Daempfe und Feuchtigkeiten\" durch die Moxa findet laut Buschoff am besten auf den Adern statt. Diese Deutung ist ein Reflex auf die Trakte und Kanaele (Meridiane) der chinesischen Anatomie. Auf festgesetzten Punkten wird dort in der Tat aufgestautes, ueberschuessiges \"Qi\" abgeuehrt. Buschoffs Schrift uebte einen grossen Einfluss auf die spaeteren europaeischen Beobachter und Autoren aus. Auch nachdem man seinen Namen schon vergessen hatte, galt die in Asien eigentlich universell eingesetzte Moxa im Westen vorwiegend als Heilmittel gegen Podagra.

In Accordance with these Dutch Merchant boats arrived in the Red Sea harbours of Yemen in 1614. Dutch East India Company owned these boats and they want to establish a trading Office (Factorij) in Yemen\u2019s ports. \u0130n 1616 the Dutch Commander Pieter van den Broecke pays a visit to Sanaa to the governor Cafer Pasha to obtain permission for trading Office in Mocha. The main Ottoman Policy after the Jeddah incident of 1517 was to make the Red Sea an internal Ottoman Sea, and giving no permission to foreign Christian Powers  to enter the Red Sea, because of the possible dangers for the Holy places of Mecca and Medina.  For this policy, Ottomans started to conquer Yemen and the African Coast of Red Sea. In addition, no western power was allowed to enter the Red Sea even for Trade. This policy lasted until 1618. \nAfter long correspondence, the ottoman Sultan Osman II gives permission for opening of an Office. These activities of the Dutch were the first as such fort he western European countries. The Dutch National archives contain many documents concerning the Dutch activities during the period 1614-1635, and they give insight into the internal situation of Yemen. \n\n",

Images of perpetually floating, dew-drinking birds from a \u2018spice island\u2019 paradise were the imagined animate counterparts to the legless skins that were brought from the Indies. These rare skins were bought at great expense to become highly prized items in curiosity collections. Yet, bird of paradise skins had been traded for many thousands of years before Europeans reached the Indies. Skins prepared by hunters were exchanged as part of relations between New Guinean tribes, transported in kora kora craft around local trade networks in South East Asia, and passed into mainland Asia from key entrep\u00f4ts such as the port of Malacca. \r\n\r\nThese trade networks led to interactions between diverse groups of people, from tribal hunters to Moluccan sultans, Asian traders to European nobles, each of whom attributed different meanings and values to the birds. The skins oscillated between being high-value commercial \u2018things\u2019 and prized symbolic \u2018objects\u2019.  Along the path of transit some of the meanings with which the birds were imbued followed the skins, and others did not, depending on the interests of people handling them.  This paper will give an overview of the formation of the different cultural constructions of the birds of paradise, that were the result of not only the bird skins themselves, but of the knowledge and symbolic meanings that were transported along with them and how this interacted with the different cultural contexts into which they were introduced. This will show how the plume preparation practices of New Guinean hunters, allowing them to literally and metaphorically inhabit the \u2018skins\u2019 of the birds, led to the distant and angelic Manucodiata of early modern Europe; and how fragments of information carried by Asian traders reached and rebounded from mainland Asia to create the Mamuco Diuata (birds of God) in South East Asian cultures that had newly converted to Islam.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32676128, "asset_id": 5596701, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

study focuses on colonial town planning carried out by the Dutch East India Company in Asia in the 17th century, taking four cities in the Asian trading network as examples. The overseas town planning carried out by this company was probably influenced by a combination of local Dutch theories and practical traditions, as well as geographical, military, political, and economic factors. This study is therefore aimed toward answering the following question: How can all of the related factors be combined in such a way as to lead to a comprehensive understanding the company's overseas town planning process?\n\nThe study begins by revealing the relevance of the form and meaning of Simon Stevin's theories of Dutch town planning. Then, town planning in four cities overseas is reconstructed based on historical images and documents. The company\u2019s establishment of cities overseas through forceful conquest and governance policies was fundamentally carried out to achieve the company's core goal of profiteering in terms of trade. Thus, each of the proposed factors is analyzed from the perspective of a profit-oriented business group to understand the town planning scheme in the context of the company\u2019s management mode in each city. Finally, a comparison is made between these schemes and Stevin's theories of Dutch town planning.\n\nBased on the this analysis and comparison, it was concluded that Stevin's theories of Dutch town planning reflect an economically rational mode of thinking by providing a systematic planning principle for Dutch colonial cities overseas rather than a direct morphological model. The company takes into account the business objectives related to different regional locations, the local geography, the military situation, and the ethnic structure to build a different business model in each city. A flexible business model was then used in town planning in terms of location, city contours, canal networks, and the layout of important buildings and facilities, without a fixed standard.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73513780, "asset_id": 59754483, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 124531636, "first_name": "\u90b1\u74ca\u5100", "last_name": "Chiung-Yi Chiu", "domain_name": "pku", "page_name": "\u90b1\u74ca\u5100ChiungYiChiu", "display_name": "\u90b1\u74ca\u5100 Chiung-Yi Chiu", "profile_url": "https://pku.academia.edu/%E9%82%B1%E7%93%8A%E5%84%80ChiungYiChiu?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/124531636/42567391/55259639/s65__.chiung-yi_chiu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8724, "name": "17th-Century Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th-Century_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 40606, "name": "Town planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Town_planning?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 378704, "name": "Asian cities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_cities?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 54232693, "title": "\"VOC Slave Trading Strategies on the Madagascar to Cape Slave Route, 1676-1781\"", "created_at": "2021-09-30T02:59:24.652-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/54232693/_VOC_Slave_Trading_Strategies_on_the_Madagascar_to_Cape_Slave_Route_1676_1781_?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_54232693", "summary": "This article charts the development of VOC slave trading on the Cape to Madagascar slave route from 1676-1781.

Dutch VOC traders and indigenous peoples through servitude, social hierarchy, and cultural hybridity. The cohabitation of the city\u2019s heterogeneous communities, coupled with the crucial yet threatening economic position of the Chinese, required careful VOC regulation in order to maintain their superior social position. A pajong-bearer depicted in the painting invites investigation into this social hierarchization, as well as the reception of representations of indigenous people and spaces during the era of Dutch globalization. Partially subsumed behind the prominent Dutch couple, yet accented by the large pajong, the figure is depicted as a Europeanized foil to the Dutch commander. Through analysis of the significance of the pajong-bearer, I argue that Cuyp portrayed Dutch culture as superior and all-encompassing in order to reflect optimism in the future success of VOC trade and settlements in Asia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64059658, "asset_id": 43748401, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 79846029, "first_name": "Alaina", "last_name": "Hendrickson", "domain_name": "american", "page_name": "AlainaHendrickson", "display_name": "Alaina Hendrickson", "profile_url": "https://american.academia.edu/AlainaHendrickson?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/79846029/20655524/35837660/s65_alaina.hendrickson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5081, "name": "Painting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Painting?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8734, "name": "Masculinity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Masculinity?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 10006, "name": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_and_Racial_Studies?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 24294, "name": "Gender and Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Race?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 26606, "name": "17th Century Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 49917, "name": "Dutch History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 80087, "name": "Hegemonic Masculinity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hegemonic_Masculinity?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 121119, "name": "17th century Dutch Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_century_Dutch_Art?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 166284, "name": "Batavia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Batavia?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 427024, "name": "Global trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_trade?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 610983, "name": "Dutch colonial history in Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_colonial_history_in_Indonesia?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1172058, "name": "Aelbert Cuyp", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aelbert_Cuyp?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 37418834, "title": "The value of Admiral Matelieff's writings for studying the history of Southeast Asia,\r\nc.1600\u20131620", "created_at": "2018-09-15T00:08:22.971-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37418834/The_value_of_Admiral_Matelieffs_writings_for_studying_the_history_of_Southeast_Asia_c_1600_1620?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_37418834", "summary": "NOW FREELY DOWNLOADABLE VIA OPEN ACCESS\n\nCornelis Matelieff de Jonge (also Cornelis Cornelisz.

Such a megacorp maintains its own army, creates its own laws and currency, grants citizenship to employees and customers, and governs vast swaths of cyberspace and the physical world. If it allows traditional governments to survive in some vestigial form, it\u2019s only so they can handle those mundane tasks that the megacorp doesn\u2019t want to deal with itself. By these standards, contemporary companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, ExxonMobil, and Walmart aren\u2019t (yet) \u201cmegacorps\u201d; they\u2019re the playthings that megacorps gobble up to use for spare parts. \n \nThis volume develops a comprehensive intellectual history of the megacorp. It locates forebears of the cyberpunk megacorp not only in earlier fictional works like \u010capek\u2019s R.U.R. (1921) and Von Harbou\u2019s Metropolis (1925) but in a string of real-world organizations ranging from the 17th-Century British and Dutch East India Companies to the Pullman Palace Car Company, the Ford Motor Company, and late 20th-Century Japanese keiretsu and South Korean chaebol \u2013 as well as in the nearly indestructible oligopolistic \u201cmegacorp\u201d described in the pioneering theory of American economist Alfred Eichner. \n \nBy investigating the nature of the cyberpunk megacorp as a political entity, commercial entity, producer and exploiter of futuristic technologies, and generator or manipulator of culture, differences are highlighted between the megacorps of \u201cclassical\u201d cyberpunk and post-cyberpunk fiction. Classical cyberpunk megacorps \u2013 portrayed in novels like Gibson\u2019s Sprawl trilogy, films like RoboCop and Johnny Mnemonic, and games like Cyberpunk, Cyberspace, and Syndicate \u2013 are often ostentatiously malevolent and obsessed with short-term financial profits to the exclusion of all else; the over-the-top depictions of such companies serve a dramatic purpose and are not offered by their authors as serious futurological studies. On the other hand, the more nuanced and philosophically rich portrayals of megacorps in post-cyberpunk works like Shirow\u2019s manga The Ghost in the Shell reveal companies that are less overtly evil, possess a broader and more plausible range of long-term strategic goals, and coexist alongside conventional governments in a state of (begrudging) mutual respect. Yet other works like the game Shadowrun depict companies that combine elements of both classical cyberpunk and post-cyberpunk megacorps. \n \nDrawing on such analyses, the volume concludes by exploring how the idea of the post-cyberpunk megacorp anticipated a new type of real-world megacorp \u2013 the unfathomably large, fast, and complex \u201crhizocorp\u201d \u2013 that's now being made possible through ongoing revolutions in the exploitation of robotics, AI, and the Internet of Things \u2013 and which threatens to become the dominant economic, political, and sociocultural power of our technologically posthumanized future world.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3436579, "first_name": "Matthew", "last_name": "Gladden", "domain_name": "georgetown", "page_name": "MatthewGladden", "display_name": "Matthew Gladden", "profile_url": "https://georgetown.academia.edu/MatthewGladden?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3436579/6167991/6990131/s65_matthew.gladden.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 558, "name": "Corporations (Law)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Corporations_Law_?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1452, "name": "Corporate Social Responsibility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Corporate_Social_Responsibility?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4167, "name": "Corporate Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Corporate_Governance?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4289, "name": "Cyberpunk", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberpunk?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29571, "name": "Multinational Corporations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multinational_Corporations?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 51611, "name": "William Gibson", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/William_Gibson?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 70643, "name": "Privatization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Privatization?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 121158, "name": "Mercenaries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mercenaries?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 184562, "name": "Oligopoly", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oligopoly?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 206943, "name": "Blade Runner", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Blade_Runner?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 206944, "name": "Metropolis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Metropolis?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 398951, "name": "Ghost in the Shell", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ghost_in_the_Shell?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 513595, "name": "Transnational Corporations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_Corporations?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 821684, "name": "Monopoly", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Monopoly?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1324609, "name": "Masamune Shirow", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Masamune_Shirow?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 2671772, "name": "Megacorporations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Megacorporations?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 2671773, "name": "Megacorps", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Megacorps?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 3302123, "name": "Shadowrun", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shadowrun?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 38056394, "title": "Book flyer: The Dutch and English East India Companies", "created_at": "2018-12-29T06:28:02.834-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38056394/Book_flyer_The_Dutch_and_English_East_India_Companies?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_38056394", "summary": "Full title: The Dutch and English East India Companies: Diplomacy, Trade and Violence in Early Modern Asia\nVolume Editors: Adam Clulow, Tristan Mostert\nPublisher: Amsterdam University Press\nSeries: Asian History, https://www.aup.nl/en/series/asian-history\n\nThe Dutch and English East India Companies were formidable organizations that were gifted with expansive powers that allowed them to conduct diplomacy, wage war and seize territorial possessions. But they did not move into an empty arena in which they were free to deploy these powers without resistance. Early modern Asia stood at the center of the global economy and was home to powerful states and sprawling commercial networks. The companies may have been global enterprises, but they operated in a globalized region in which they encountered a range of formidable competitors. This groundbreaking collection of essays explores the place of the Dutch and English East India Companies in Asia and the nature of their engagement with Asian rulers, officials, merchants, soldiers, and brokers. With contributions from some of the most innovative historians in the field, The Dutch and English East India Companies: Diplomacy, Trade and Violence in Early Modern Asia presents new ways to understand these organizations by focusing on their diplomatic, commercial, and military interactions with Asia.\n\nTable of Contents: Introduction, The Companies in Asia, Adam Clulow and Tristan Mostert;

As a result the New Netherlanders relationship with the Native Americans were more cooperative than the Cape Colony setters who competed with the Khoekhoe (African population of the Cape) for beef supplies. But this contrast is a drastic oversimplification.\n\nFirst of all, there are differences in climate and geography. The Cape Colony is in the Southern Hemisphere, and New Netherland in the Northern. Thus, not only are the seasons reversed, but there is a difference between the Mediterranean climate of the Cape and the seasonal weather contrasts in New Netherland. This resulted in differences between the horticulture-hunting-gathering economy of the Native Americans and the hunter-gathering-livestock raising economy of the Khoekhoe on the Cape. While farming in New Netherland was primarily in grain production, Cape Colony became mainly pastoral, that is, cattle ranching. In addition the Delaware, Hudson, and Mohawk rivers gave the Dutch in New Netherland immediate access to the interior, whereas a narrow, fertile coastal plain with the Great Karoo semi-desert and Drakenberg Mountain inland initially restricted the Dutch settlement in the Cape to the coastal region. \n\nThe Dutch East India Company (VOC) was established in 1603 to counter the influence of the Portugal (which had been united with Spain in 1580) that was establishing trading posts Africa and the East Indies. The Netherlands had declared its independence from Spain in 1581, and Spain brought Portugal into its war against the Netherlands. In 1609 Spain and the Netherlands signed a 12-Year Truce. The same year the English sea captain Henry Hudson, working for the Dutch East India Company, tried to find a northwest passage to the East Indies. Instead, he explored the Hudson River, where he came in contact with Munsee and Mohican Indians. Despite attempts to trade with them, the first contact involved some peaceful but numerous violent incidents. .\n\nThe Dutch West India Company (WIC) was founded in 1621 at the end of the 12-year truce. In addition to trade between the Netherlands, Africa, and the Americas, it was intended as a military post to support the renewed war against Spain in the West Indies and the  Portuguese in Brazil. It also had a religious and political dimension. There was a division within the Dutch Reformed Church between the so-called Remonstrants (followers of Jacobus Arminius, who taught that people could achieve salvation by faith) and the Counter-Remonstrants (followers of Franciscus Gomarus, who adhered to the strict Calvinist belief in predestination). The largest subscriber to the Zeeland chamber of the VOC in 1602 was a timber merchant from Dordrecht named Cornelis de Witt, one of whose sons Jacob de Witt became treasurer of the Synod of Dordt in 1618 (that repudiated Arminius) and an opponent of William II of the House of Orange.  Most of the directors of the WIC were Counter-Remonstrants. \n\nThere were also major differences in the populations that settled the Cape Colony and the Dutch West East India and New Netherland.  Almost half the Dutch in New Netherland came from places outside the present boundaries of the Netherlands. These settlers from diverse background became Dutch by adopting the Dutch names, the Dutch language, and the Dutch Reformed religion. And not all of the people who became culturally Dutch in New Netherland were white. From the 1620s onwards the Dutch became involved in the slave trade from West Africa to the Americas. Many of the slaves who came to New Netherland arrived by way of the Dutch slave entrep\u00f4t on the Caribbean island of Cura\u03c2ao. Some slaves were probably captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships, other were brought from Brazil after it was captured by the Dutch in 1634.  Some of the Company slaves were freed as early as the 1640s. Most of the Afro-Dutch later merged with the general American-American community. One small group, known in the nineteenth century as later as the \u201cJackson Whites,\u201d adopted a separate racial identity as descendants of Hessians, Dutch, and Native Americans.\n\nIn April 1652 the Dutch East India Company established a settlement on Table Bay under the command of Jan van Riebeeck. One member of the van Riebeeck\u2019 crew was Polish. Between 1652 and 1814 more established families from Royal (Western) Prussia and Ducal (Eastern) Prussia came to the Cape. Between 1707 and 1778 additional settlers came mostly as soldiers and seamen. Again the largest group came from Gdansk. While the Afrikaaners developed a Dutch language and the Dutch Reformed religion their ancestry was even more mixed than that of Dutch-Americans in New Netherland.\n\nThe Native Americans the Dutch encountered were not a single group. They were divided into competing and even warring linguistic and territorial groups. In the northern Hudson Valley were the Algonquian-speaking Mahican Indians.  To the west along the Mohawk River and the Finger Lakes were the Iroquoian-speaking Five Nations (the Mohawks, the Oneida, the Onondaga, the Cayuga, and the Seneca). \n\nIn the Cape Colony there were two distinct prehistoric peoples: the Khoikhoi (\u201cmen of men\u201d) and the San or \u201cBushmen.\u201d  Both have been grouped together under the name Khoisan. Finding the  Khoisans (i.e., Khoikhoi and San) uncooperative, the Dutch began to transport to their colony Negro slaves from the Gold Coast and Mozambique and \u201cMalay\u201d slaves from Batavia. In 1731 the population of the Cape Colony consisted of a majority African/Asian slaves,  about a third of white settlers, and smaller numbers of  \u201cFree Blacks\u201d (excluding Khoikhoi and San), and white knegts (hired laborers). The \u201ccoloured\u201d category consisted of those with  Khosian ancestry and offspring  of Dutch males mating with Khoikhoi woman. \n\nThe Khoikhoi predate the Bantu people who migrated into what is today South Africa around 1500 A.D. There are two major Bantu linguistic groups in South Africa: the Sotho and the Nguni. The Ngoni settled along the coast of modern Natal and split into the Swazi, the Zulu, the Pondo, the Tembu and the Xhosa. \n\nAlso contrary to Schrire and Merwick,, the Dutch attitudes toward the Native-Americans were not different from the indigenous population in the Cape Colony. The Dutch called the Native Americans wilden (or \u201cwild men\u201d),  Because of this status, there was little effort to convert Native Americans to Christianity. In both the New Netherland and the Cape Colony, Africans and Afro-Dutch were proselytized probably because of their previous exposure to Christianity by the Spaniards and the Portuguese. But in both instances, the Dutch relations with native populations were characterized by brutal warfare.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference between the Cape Colony and New Netherland had to do with migration. Most Dutch-Americans remained in New York and New Jersey after the English Conquest in 1664. While the wealthy merchants tended to adopt the English language and the Anglican religion, the rural population continued continued to speak Dutch with distinct dialects of Jersey Dutch and Mohawk Valley Dutch and to attend the Dutch Reformed Church well into the eighteenth century. The slaves and free blacks in New York and New Jersey also retained Dutch surnames, attended the Dutch Reformed Church, and had their own dialect of Dutch. These Afro-Dutch settlers eventually were integrated into the general African-American ethnic group. However, one small subgroup on the border between New York and New Jersey, previously known as the \u201cJackson Whites,\u201d or the \u201cRamapough Indians\u201d today, remained a race apart. The Munsee and the Mohegan Indians migrated north and west in the nineteenth century ending up on reservations in Canada, Kansas, and Oklahoma. The Iroquois remain on reservations in central and western New York State. \n\nWhile some Africaners remained in the Cape Colony, others migrated into the interior  along the northern fringes of the Great Karoo and along the coast. The Dutch settlers who participated in this migration were known as the Trekboers (literally, migrant farmers). After the English conquest of the Cape Colony in 1814, they declared their independence as the Natalia Republic in 1839 and the Orange Free State in 1852.  But they were reunited with South Africa in 1902 after the Second Boer War. The Khoisa remained a separate group as \u201cCape Coloureds,\u201d and despite a period of segregation into separate black \u201chomelands\u201d under apartheid  between 1948 and 1994, the Xhosa remained a majority. In 1994 Nelson Mandela, a Xhosa, became the first black president of South Africa.\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67849898, "asset_id": 37252937, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1064372, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Cohen", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "httpwwwtalkinghistoryorgcohenhtml", "display_name": "David S Cohen", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/httpwwwtalkinghistoryorgcohenhtml?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1064372/427483/36885867/s65_david.cohen.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 16918, "name": "Dutch West India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_West_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 61866, "name": "South Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Africa?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 103572, "name": "Dutch Reformed Church", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_Reformed_Church?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 112455, "name": "New Netherland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Netherland?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 363443, "name": "Ramapough Mountain Indians", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ramapough_Mountain_Indians?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1187020, "name": "Afro-Dutch", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Afro-Dutch?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1458248, "name": "The Xhosa Nation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Xhosa_Nation?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 3008229, "name": "The Cape Colony", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Cape_Colony?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 3008230, "name": "The Munsees", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Munsees?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 3008231, "name": "The Mohican", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Mohican?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 3008232, "name": "The Mohawks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Mohawks?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 3008233, "name": "The Khoikhoi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Khoikhoi?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 3008234, "name": "The San", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_San?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 3008235, "name": "Cape Coloureds", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cape_Coloureds?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 3008236, "name": "The Esopus Indians", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Esopus_Indians?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 18851161, "title": "F\u00fcr eine Welten-Geschichte (Merkur, n\u00b0 799, 12.2015)", "created_at": "2015-11-23T03:01:15.532-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/18851161/F%C3%BCr_eine_Welten_Geschichte_Merkur_n_799_12_2015_?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_18851161", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40289952, "asset_id": 18851161, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3058373, "first_name": "Romain", "last_name": "Bertrand", "domain_name": "sciences-po", "page_name": "RomainBertrand", "display_name": "Romain  Bertrand", "profile_url": "https://sciences-po.academia.edu/RomainBertrand?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3058373/1005461/1257281/s65_romain.bertrand.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26606, "name": "17th Century Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 27811, "name": "German Colonial Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_Colonial_Empire?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65700, "name": "Geschichte", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geschichte?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 680531, "name": "Histoire sociale", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Histoire_sociale?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1019273, "name": "Colonialism and Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism_and_Imperialism?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 16116379, "title": "\u2018Ick vertrouwe dat de werelt hem naer dien op twee polen keert\u2019 -

"Using published and unpublished documents of Dutch, Portuguese and Malay provenance, the present study explores how news of the Twelve Years Truce in December 1609 negatively impacted politics and commerce at the court of the Kingdom of Johor. Since 1603, Johor had emerged as one of the principal allies of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in the region of the Singapore and Melaka Straits, and after 1606 it had proven itself as a worthy ally in the company\u2019s war on the Iberian powers across Southeast Asia. It will be argued that confusion resulting from the news of the truce on the ground in Asia exacerbated factionalism at the court. The Johor ruler, Ala\u2019udin Ri\u2019ayat Shah III, and especially his younger sibling Raja Bongsu, were incensed and evidently felt they had been left to carry on the struggle against Portuguese Melaka on their own. Unable to continue the war effort without Dutch funds, subsidies and ammunition, the pro-Portuguese faction at the Johor court brokered a peace with the Estado da \u00cdndia in October 1610. This deal led to the fall of Raja Bongsu and his pro-Dutch faction at the court. This essay provides the political and historical backdrop to the writing and revision of the Sejarah Melayu, or Malay Annals, in or around 1612.

This article recovers the writings of F\u00e9lix Fernando de Sotomayor, Duke of Sotomayor (1684\u20131767), who drew on the works of Grotius, Samuel Pufendorf, and Charles Dutot in order to show that the history of these corporations chronicled the contestation and erosion of Spanish power and the diversion of European states from their true interests. Sovereigns, not merchants, argued Sotomayor, could guarantee fair trade and the equitable distribution of wealth. The study of Sotomayor\u2019s views on trade, natural law, and alienation challenges traditional interpretations about the Iberian engagement with Grotius, the rise of capitalist hopes in Southern and Northern Europe, and Spain\u2019s investment in the Enlightenment.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3956758, "first_name": "Edward", "last_name": "Jones Corredera", "domain_name": "mpil", "page_name": "EdwardJonesCorredera", "display_name": "Edward Jones Corredera", "profile_url": "https://mpil.academia.edu/EdwardJonesCorredera?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3956758/11780341/36570594/s65_edward.jones_corredera.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 802, "name": "Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Economy?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4154, "name": "Iberian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iberian_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4296, "name": "Natural Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Natural_Law?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5231, "name": "Eighteenth Century History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eighteenth_Century_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9690, "name": "Intellectual History of Enlightenment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intellectual_History_of_Enlightenment?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 18727, "name": "History of Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Imperialism?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 26950, "name": "Enlightenment Political Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Enlightenment_Political_Thought?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 29571, "name": "Multinational Corporations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multinational_Corporations?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 42066, "name": "Early modern Spain", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_modern_Spain?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 47133, "name": "Hugo Grotius", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hugo_Grotius?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 58559, "name": "East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 135661, "name": "Spanish enlightenment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spanish_enlightenment?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 49528396, "title": "Yixing l'art de la th\u00e9i\u00e8re pourpre, Bruxelles, 2001", "created_at": "2021-07-03T11:40:48.956-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49528396/Yixing_lart_de_la_th%C3%A9i%C3%A8re_pourpre_Bruxelles_2001?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_49528396", "summary": "Yixing, the Art of purple teapot, exhibited from April 5th to September 30th, 2001, antique teapots from Arthur Harris collection, London;

However, after years of rapidly changing circumstances and twists and turns, this promising young naturalist settled down to serve the British in Ceylon without ever returning to Europe.

It was dedicated to the Duke of Saxony Johann Georg III. and published in 1686 as a private print under the title \"Short explanation of the most prominent rarities in East India and the neighbouring kingdoms\". The author Caspar Schamberger (1623-1706) had worked in Asia for twelve years as a surgeon on VOC ships and in Dutch trading posts. He is known as the \"father\" of the first fully-fledged Western-style medical school in Japan. His text describes fruits, plants, animals, ethnic groups, coins etc. from Persia to Japan including the Khoikhoi (Khoisan) in Southern Africa. This is one of the earliest Western accounts of these matters based on observations made during the late 1640s and 1650s. The extensive commentary (126 pages) gives an outline of Schamberger's life presenting numerous new information on his activities after his return to Leipzig in 1658. Schamberger's descriptions are analysed in detail within the context of similar accounts of nine contemporary German travellers: Caspar Schmalkalden, Zacharias Wagener, Heinrich Muche, Johann Wilhelm Vogel, Elias Hesse, Albrecht Herport, George Meister, Andreas Cleyer, Engelbert Kaempfer.

Cornelis\u2019s text is leading in the analysis and is presented more or less chronological. To be able to distinguish the two authors Cornelis\u2019s text is shown in the analysis with an indentation. Both texts in old Dutch are directly followed by a translation which stays as close as possible to the original text.\n\nThe perspective from which the two books are viewed is a practical one. The questions \u201cWhat did it look like\u201d? and \u201cHow did they do it\u201d? provide the basis. Subject is the establishment of the shape of the hull and if a team of skilled shipwrights would read the text they should be able to build the described ship. The reconstruction of a ship with a length of 155 feet from stem to stern provides the thread in the analysis. This length is chosen because Cornelis provides two comprehensive certers, one of a ship of 155 feet built in 1664 and one of 154 built in 1667 where he gives an enormous amount of information of these closely related and comparable ships. The text is supported by a computer reconstruction in 3D which creates on its own terms the need for precise dimensions and appearances. The text is adapted as new insights emerge and/or additional information is generated for example by discussion and suggestions from people who have read the text and comment on it. I have deliberately chosen this form because it always broadens and deepens my own judgment and insight and this will be beneficial to the text.

This paper looks at the first encounters between European mariners and the Australian landscape, focusing on a single site on Dirk Hartog Island, on the western Australian coast. From the early 17th century Dirk Hartog Island became one of the few fixed and known points on the largely unmapped Australian coastline. Over a period of several hundred years its northern tip was repeatedly visited by a succession of Dutch, French and English explorers, sometimes accidentally but usually intentionally, replicating each other's movements up the cliffs to stand on the rocky headlands overlooking Shark Bay. More importantly, each group left behind a physical testament to their presence, alternately removing, repairing or adding to the monuments left by those who preceded them. This paper examines these encounters and this site in terms of some of the themes suggested by Westerdahl's work, including territoriality and pilgrimage among explorers as a maritime community.

Following the well-known dictum that seas unite while the land divides, historians have looked to the seas as the most crucial conduit for human interaction and the principal medium by which foreign influences entered the region. Yet, for many Southeast Asians, the seas were much more than simply a void to be crossed. This statement is especially true for island Southeast Asia, where daily life for its inhabitants is closely calibrated with the rhythms of the monsoon winds and ocean currents, and where the vast expanse of the sea dwarfs in both size and significance the land that it envelops. There, the seas and littoral are the primary spaces of interaction and thus a crucial element in the history of the region.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous ethnic groups in island Southeast Asia, the powerful influence of the sea on daily life is perhaps nowhere more apparent than in the communities of Sama Bajo sea peoples that inhabit the region. For the Sama Bajo, the seas and littoral are the primary setting of their histories and the focal point of their culture. \r\nFocusing on the sea-centred Sama Bajo communities of eastern Indonesia during the early modern period, in this seminar Nolde will discuss the pervasive influence of the sea in the lives of the Sama Bajo, and demonstrate how their unique relationship to the sea helped to shape the course of their history. While most scholars have characterized the Sama Bajo as timid sea nomads, marginal to the region\u2019s important historical developments, based on extensive research in Sama Bajo oral and written traditions, Makassarese and Bugis manuscript sources, and the archives of the Dutch East India Company, Nolde argues that the Sama Bajo were in fact central to processes of state formation, commerce, and regional integration in eastern Indonesia.  \r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36923893, "asset_id": 11352309, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

Taiwanese readers must be familiar with the section about Formosa in the Fourth Boek, Fourth Deel, for this section was incorporated and translated to English in William Campbell\u2019s Formosa under the Dutch (1903). However, Campbell did not faithfully copy Valentyn\u2019s Formosan ethnography, but he replaced it with Georgius Candidius\u2019 \u201cDiscours ende Cort verhael, van't Eylant Formosa\u201d (1628). By a comparison between Candidius\u2019 and Valentyn\u2019s ethnography, I found that the Formosan ethnography in \u2019t verwaerloosde Formosa (1675) is the bridge between Candidius and Valentyn. Valentyn compiled his Formosan ethnography largely from abridging the one of C. E. S. Nevertheless, in the description of Formosan religious practices, Valentyn neglected the account of C. E. S. but relied on Candidius\u2019 sensational report. Valentyn\u2019s editorial selection clearly demonstrated his strong personal opinions and chauvinism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59973975, "asset_id": 39788456, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14875171, "first_name": "Hung-yi", "last_name": "Chien", "domain_name": "ncku", "page_name": "HungyiChien", "display_name": "Hung-yi Chien", "profile_url": "https://ncku.academia.edu/HungyiChien?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14875171/13981103/21168803/s65_hung-yi.chien.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3524, "name": "Historiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historiography?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15658, "name": "History of Taiwan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Taiwan?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37444284, "title": "Linking Dutch Trading Posts with Uncommon Cat Tail", "created_at": "2018-09-19T11:43:15.480-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37444284/Linking_Dutch_Trading_Posts_with_Uncommon_Cat_Tail?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_37444284", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57411252, "asset_id": 37444284, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14875171, "first_name": "Hung-yi", "last_name": "Chien", "domain_name": "ncku", "page_name": "HungyiChien", "display_name": "Hung-yi Chien", "profile_url": "https://ncku.academia.edu/HungyiChien?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14875171/13981103/21168803/s65_hung-yi.chien.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 113037, "name": "Maritme History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritme_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 301233, "name": "Nagasaki", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nagasaki?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 577933, "name": "Genetic variation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genetic_variation?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 996172, "name": "Felis Catus", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Felis_Catus?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 37178415, "title": "Dutch East India Company Shipbuilding -- Chapter 3 (Site Formation, Excavation, and Reconstruction)", "created_at": "2018-08-03T21:59:31.173-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37178415/Dutch_East_India_Company_Shipbuilding_Chapter_3_Site_Formation_Excavation_and_Reconstruction_?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_37178415", "summary": "Eight months into its maiden voyage to the Indies, the Dutch East India Company\u2019s Batavia sank on 4 June 1629 on Morning Reef in the Houtman Abrolhos off the western coast of Australia.

Thus, these accounts deal with kings and queens, the power of courtiers, and both courtly protocol and insults.

Cornelis\u2019s text is leading in the analysis and is presented more or less chronological. To be able to distinguish the two authors Cornelis\u2019s text is shown in the analysis with an indentation. Both texts in old Dutch are directly followed by a translation which stays as close as possible to the original text.\n\nThe perspective from which the two books are viewed is a practical one. The questions \u201cWhat did it look like\u201d? and \u201cHow did they do it\u201d? provide the basis. Subject is the establishment of the shape of the hull and if a team of skilled shipwrights would read the text they should be able to build the described ship. The reconstruction of a ship with a length of 155 feet from stem to stern provides the thread in the analysis. This length is chosen because Cornelis provides two comprehensive certers, one of a ship of 155 feet built in 1664 and one of 154 built in 1667 where he gives an enormous amount of information of these closely related and comparable ships. The text is supported by a computer reconstruction in 3D which creates on its own terms the need for precise dimensions and appearances. The text is adapted as new insights emerge and/or additional information is generated for example by discussion and suggestions from people who have read the text and comment on it. I have deliberately chosen this form because it always broadens and deepens my own judgment and insight and this will be beneficial to the text. Nothing is ever really finished.\n\nThe place where to find the quoted passages in the original books is in Cornelis\u2019s case given by a page and a line for example (p.1, l.2), in Nicolaes\u2019s case a column number is added (1 or 2) and the edition is mentioned, for example (p.1, c. 2, l. 3, 1671).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50133554, "asset_id": 29640482, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26011191, "first_name": "Jaap", "last_name": "Luiting", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JaapLuiting", "display_name": "Jaap Luiting", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JaapLuiting?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26011191/7141221/17399063/s65_jaap.luiting.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 26606, "name": "17th Century Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 406927, "name": "Dutch shipbuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_shipbuilding?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1126452, "name": "Nicolaes Witsen (1641-1717)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nicolaes_Witsen_1641-1717_?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1924527, "name": "Cornelis van Yk", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cornelis_van_Yk?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 21697928, "title": "Beads from the wreck of the Dutch East Indiaman De Liefde (1711)", "created_at": "2016-02-08T11:15:49.081-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/21697928/Beads_from_the_wreck_of_the_Dutch_East_Indiaman_De_Liefde_1711_?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_21697928", "summary": "Describes the beads recovered from the wreck of De Liefde, a Dutch United East India Co.

It is an opportunity to look back on the previous decade of research, identify accomplishments, and chart future directions. We note a significant historiographical shift from research that focused broadly on colonised peoples, particularly slaves and Khoesan, to emerging literatures that give equally careful attention to colonisers. This shift moves the field toward a more complete picture of colonial society; it accompanies a present period of political uncertainty. The growing body of scholarship on early colonial history is drawing more practitioners. The resulting exploration of new topics and the revision of existing interpretations are producing robust, methodologically diverse work, especially noteworthy for its interdisciplinarity. While this work increasingly situates the Cape in broader regional and global histories, even more intentional efforts are required in order to avoid parochialism. The transition from Dutch to British rule at the Cape also requires further scrutiny.

As the Twelve Year\u2019s Truce (1609\u20131621) expired, the United East Indian Company (VOC) took the initiative to get rid the Portuguese empire in Asia, called Estado da \u00cdndia, of maritime dominance. At the same time, it exploited the Portuguese inability to carry out fundamental structural reforms, as well as the Portuguese\u2011Spanish suspicions and rivalries, which prevented mutual effective cooperation. First, in 1621\u20131635, it asserted its complete superiority in Insulindia and the Far East, and, subsequently, between 1635 and 1669, it shattered the Portuguese power in the western Indian Ocean. The result was the collapse of Estado da \u00cdndia and the establishment of a Dutch monopoly for commerce in spices. Finally, the author seeks an overall assessment of the Portuguese-Dutch conflict and its effects on the Estado da \u00cdndia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68204939, "asset_id": 49419904, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 76079154, "asset_id": 49419904, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3697817, "first_name": "Karel", "last_name": "Stan\u011bk", "domain_name": "nkp", "page_name": "KarelStan\u011bk", "display_name": "Karel Stan\u011bk", "profile_url": "https://nkp.academia.edu/KarelStan%C4%9Bk?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3697817/1316918/38346898/s65_karel.stan_k.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2861, "name": "Portuguese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portuguese_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4916, "name": "Portuguese Discoveries and Expansion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portuguese_Discoveries_and_Expansion?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20433, "name": "History of the Portuguese Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Portuguese_Empire?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 49917, "name": "Dutch History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 218722, "name": "Dutch overseas history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_overseas_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 433549, "name": "Portuguese expansion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portuguese_expansion?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 511225, "name": "History of the Portuguese Expansion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Portuguese_Expansion?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 552311, "name": "Portuguese Overseas Expansion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portuguese_Overseas_Expansion?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 43099968, "title": "Monitoring Report of the present conditions of a 17th century wreck site at Quissimajulo bay, Nampula, Mozambique, April 2012", "created_at": "2020-05-18T18:23:21.968-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43099968/Monitoring_Report_of_the_present_conditions_of_a_17th_century_wreck_site_at_Quissimajulo_bay_Nampula_Mozambique_April_2012?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_43099968", "summary": "This is a monitoring visit to a 17th century wreck site discovered in previous expeditions and tentatively identified as t\u2019 Hert, Dutch, 1622.

This was especially true in Japan\u2019s expanded print culture, and specifically in the encyclopedic books that categorized information and promoted cities and locales through through depictions of famous sights and local specialties. An examination of images of Nagasaki from the late Edo period shows that illustrations of Dutch ships and the annual spectacle of their arrival were common and visually connected to the city itself, much in the same way that other locales were represented by their attractions or products (for example, the cherry blossoms of Yoshino, or tea from Uji.) The foreign presence in Nagasaki, and the Dutch ships in particular, became a part of Nagasaki\u2019s visual identity and branding during the Edo period, highlighting the city\u2019s role as the link between Japan, Asia, and Europe before expanded relations during the Meiji period (1868\u20131912).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58522972, "asset_id": 38459052, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49471511, "first_name": "Harrison", "last_name": "Schley", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "HarrisonSchley", "display_name": "Harrison Schley", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/HarrisonSchley?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/49471511/23139449/22247147/s65_harry.schley.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 32191, "name": "Japanese Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_Art_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1949800, "name": "Japanese-Foreigners Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese-Foreigners_Relations?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 38453974, "title": "Maharana Sangram Singh of Udaipur entertaining members of the Dutch East India Company led by Johan Josua Ketelaar", "created_at": "2019-02-28T00:40:25.046-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38453974/Maharana_Sangram_Singh_of_Udaipur_entertaining_members_of_the_Dutch_East_India_Company_led_by_Johan_Josua_Ketelaar?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_38453974", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58517172, "asset_id": 38453974, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 45140973, "first_name": "Joachim K", "last_name": "Bautze", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JoachimKBautze", "display_name": "Joachim K Bautze", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JoachimKBautze?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/45140973/22395109/21603439/s65_joachim_k.bautze.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 51030, "name": "History of Indian Painting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Indian_Painting?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 93708, "name": "Persian and Indian Miniature Painting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persian_and_Indian_Miniature_Painting?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 779328, "name": "Indian Painting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Painting?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 795131, "name": "History of Indian Princely States", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Indian_Princely_States?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1468906, "name": "Indian miniature painting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_miniature_painting?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1813724, "name": "Rajasthani Painting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rajasthani_Painting?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 37221729, "title": "Dutch East India Company Shipbuilding -- Chapter 5 (Archaeology of Dutch Ocean-Going Vessels)", "created_at": "2018-08-12T06:42:22.726-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37221729/Dutch_East_India_Company_Shipbuilding_Chapter_5_Archaeology_of_Dutch_Ocean_Going_Vessels_?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_37221729", "summary": "\nEight months into its maiden voyage to the Indies, the Dutch East India Company\u2019s Batavia sank on 4 June 1629 on Morning Reef in the Houtman Abrolhos off the western coast of Australia.

This paper uses land contracts collected in H\u1ed9i An ch\u014dka bunsh\u016b (Documents of Merchant Family House in H\u1ed9i An) and lawsuits kept in Gong An Bu (Minutes of the Board Meetings of the Chinese Council [in Batavia]) to reveal the Chinese female socioeconomic activities in two host societies, H\u1ed9i An under the Qu\u1ea3ng Nam regime in southern Vietnam and Batavia under the colonial Dutch dominance in Java, from 1700s to 1800s. By using the contracts and legal documents, I argue that overseas Chinese female or hybrid native-born women inherited the relative equal status of Southeast Asian \u201ctradition\u201d and played a significant role on social economic issues. The activity on land or estate purchasing and lawsuit filing created not only the base with land and housing, but also the real home for the ethnic Chinese, and it also made the durable commercial activity and public participation possible as well as changing the scene of the cities as their new \u201chome.\u201d In short, this paper explores the commercial activities of female Chinese in Southeast Asia, revealing further the interaction of cultural encounters in two host societies.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56096279, "asset_id": 36195104, "asset_type": "Work",

Focus shall be placed on two interrelated developments: one, the first diplomatic mission to the Dutch Republic in 1608-10; and two, a scheme hatched by Siamese officials to assist the Dutch in obtaining access to the Chinese marketplace. This has deemed necessary after the Dutch, supported by some overseas Chinese businessmen from Southeast Asia, had failed to gain trading access in 1604. On the Dutch side, two men stand in the limelight: Admiral Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge, a director of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and supreme commander of its second fleet to Asia, as well as Hugo Grotius, who at the time was a rising star in the Dutch government and later would be celebrated as one of the pathbreakers of modern international law. Their hitherto published and unpublished manuscripts will be examined to ascertain how Matelieff and the VOC directors reacted to these Siamese initiatives and how in turn, the admiral sought to mobilize and co-opt the Siamese into his own commercial and military agenda with the help of Grotius. Introduction Much ink has been spilled in discussing how Siam (Thailand) successfully resisted French and British advances during the territorial grab of the late nineteenth century. Studies have focused on the comprehensive reform programmes launched by kings Mongkut and Chulalongkorn to modernize Siam that aimed at reducing or eliminating the chance of seeing their territorial space and political agency whittled away by the European imperial powers. Such a display of agency by the Siamese monarchs, however, has instructive antecedents in an era when a far less confident and arrogant Europe was beginning to forge more regular contacts with the rulers of mainland and insular Southeast Asia.1 This article will examine how, during the first two decades of the seventeenth century, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) responded to Siam as a potential mediator, able to help the Dutch gain access to the China trade, and also as a potential military ally against the Portuguese in Southeast Asia. The article will show how the Siamese proactively engaged the VOC in order to further both Dutch and Siamese ends. This makes an interesting contrast to the situation in later centuries when", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59972937, "asset_id": 32902158, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 138, "name": "Diplomatic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomatic_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3180, "name": "International Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Trade?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 4409, "name": "Naval History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Naval_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 5649, "name": "South-East Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South-East_Asia?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 8225, "name": "Taiwan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Taiwan_Studies?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 9707, "name": "Diplomacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomacy?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 12108, "name": "China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 15658, "name": "History of Taiwan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Taiwan?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 20433, "name": "History of the Portuguese Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Portuguese_Empire?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 47133, "name": "Hugo Grotius", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hugo_Grotius?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 49837, "name": "Historia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historia?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 88265, "name": "South east Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_east_Asia?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 97643, "name": "South East Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_East_Asian_Studies?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 104788, "name": "Hist\u00f3ria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hist%C3%B3ria?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 113008, "name": "Siam Kingdom", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Siam_Kingdom?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 113009, "name": "Kingdom of Siam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kingdom_of_Siam?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 235694, "name": "Malaysian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 273287, "name": "Johor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Johor?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 313371, "name": "Diplomacy and international relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomacy_and_international_relations?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 410377, "name": "Foreign Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foreign_Trade?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1412129, "name": "Sejarah Johor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sejarah_Johor?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 23693015, "title": "Notice Middelburg et Vlissingen.

Today, however, as power shifts away from Western nations, the issue of what is an appropriate rules-based international order is under review.\r\n \r\nRe-reading Grotius in his 17th-century context is vital. It shows how strongly his perspectives clashed with ideas dominant in Southeast Asia at that time. It takes us back to a period before Western global domination when diplomacy had to come to terms with or confront - just as increasingly it has to do today - a range and a contest of foreign-relations perspectives.\r\n \r\nMoving forward - building regional institutions, forging new forms of engagement between major powers, defining and mediating different national interests in the South China Sea - it may be fruitful to look backward as well as ahead. Doing so offers the architects of a new order a more inclusive - less narrowly-European - experience; and it is possible that we could also learn something valuable from the way international pluralities were navigated in an earlier era. \r\n\r\nA video recording is accessible at the following site:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H6L04JtORs", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

The focus will be on two interrelated developments: one, the \ufb01rst diplomatic mission to the Dutch Republic in 1608 and, two, a scheme hatched by Siamese of\ufb01cials to assist the Dutch in obtaining access to the Chinese market. This was deemed necessary after the Dutch, supported by some overseas Chinese businessmen from Southeast Asia, failed to gain trading access in 1604. On the Dutch side, two men stand in the limelight: Admiral Cornelis Matelief de Jonge, a director of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and supreme commander of its second \ufb02eet to Asia, and Hugo Grotius, who at the time was a rising star in the Dutch government and would later be celebrated as one of the path\ufb01nders of modern international law. Both their published and unpublished manuscripts will be examined to ascertain how Matelief and the VOC directors reacted to these Siamese initiatives and how, in turn, the admiral sought to mobilize and co-opt the Siamese into his own commercial and military agenda, with the help of Grotius.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59240874, "asset_id": 8830832, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 137, "name": "Economic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 138, "name": "Diplomatic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomatic_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2074, "name": "International Business", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Business?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 9707, "name": "Diplomacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomacy?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 20602, "name": "China studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China_studies?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 21168, "name": "Strategy (Business)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Strategy_Business_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 47133, "name": "Hugo Grotius", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hugo_Grotius?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 52849, "name": "History of Commerce", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Commerce?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 66842, "name": "Grotius", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Grotius?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 102503, "name": "Business Strategy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Business_Strategy?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 104788, "name": "Hist\u00f3ria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hist%C3%B3ria?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 113008, "name": "Siam Kingdom", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Siam_Kingdom?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 113009, "name": "Kingdom of Siam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kingdom_of_Siam?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 174487, "name": "Siam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Siam?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 8326285, "title": "De la mer et autres d\u00e9mons.

The figure was probably based on an earlier drawing that is now known as Man in Korean costume (J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles) (fig. 3). The drawing has been related to Siamese ambassadors in London, pagan priests in Goa, and European missionaries in China, but the association with Korea has been most persistent since it was first put forward in 1934: the sitter may have been a freed Korean slave who traveled from Japan to Rome, where Rubens could have met and portrayed him. The drawing\u2019s degree of detail suggests that at least the dress was done from observation. When the Getty Museum devoted an exhibition to the work in 2013, its experts concluded that the costume may have been authentically East Asian.

bilingual Dutch-English essay in the catalogue Sunken Treasures, edited by Karin Gaillard and Eline van den Berg, which accompanied the eponymous exhibition in the Princessehof National Museum of Ceramics in Leeuwarden, 2019 (pp. 114\u201337). Here, the Dutch text has been removed and the English text has been edited, but all figures have been kept. The essay deals with the porcelain finds from two shipwrecks: the Hatcher wreck of c. 1643 and the Geldermalsen wreck of 1751. Both finds have been of great importance for our knowledge of the porcelain trade, the types that were shipped and, in general, for the new information they provided. In the case of the Geldermalsen, the hype surrounding the auction of the porcelain cargo was a new phenomenon at the time.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64612661, "asset_id": 44241538, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 60619467, "first_name": "Christiaan", "last_name": "J\u00f6rg", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ChristiaanJ\u00f6rg", "display_name": "Christiaan J\u00f6rg", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ChristiaanJ%C3%B6rg?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://gravatar.com/avatar/25e25b088489fb28e6732373fd521465?s=65"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12108, "name": "China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48820, "name": "Shipwrecks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shipwrecks?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 239877, "name": "East West relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_West_relations?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 557026, "name": "Chinese Porcelain", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Porcelain?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1033501, "name": "Inter Asian Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Inter_Asian_Trade?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1359832, "name": "Asian Export Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Export_Art?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 43506370, "title": "CFP: \"WHY TROMPE L'OEIL?

words in Voyant Tools (https://voyant-tools.org/). Thanks goes to St\u00e9fan Sinclair for adding this list to the program!\r\n\r\nNB: I have revised and updated this file soon after adding it originally. The revision mainly involves removing the numerals and special characters at the beginning (they were from TAPORware). I have also added some words to the file after testing it on \"Aan het Volk van Nederland\" (1781). \r\n...\r\nThis .docx file includes a list of common, non-conceptual 21st- and 18th-century Dutch words (including lots of spelling variations). It is useful for computer programs that do text analysis. I developed it in order to experiment with \"distant reading\" of 18th-century Dutch sources of the sort that are available through dbnl.org and earlydutchbooksonline.nl . I use it regularly with voyant-tools.org.\r\n\r\nI'm not a native Dutch speaker, and this resource is a work-in-progress.

Dutch: duiten) to Java, which is a remarkable operation for the world\u2019s largest enterprise at that time, since these coins were unfit to pay for the company\u2019s wholesale trade. This paper argues that the VOC responded to Java\u2019s specific need for small coins, because people increasingly relied on the market for daily necessities and became less dependent on subsistence farming. The alternative explanations of population growth, substitution and inflation do not satisfactorily explain the increased demand for these copper doits. Therefore, this paper proposes that Java\u2019s economy underwent a transformation, particularly after 1750.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis WP is published as an article in the special issue 'Coins, Currencies, and Credit Instruments' of the Tijdschrift voor Sociale en Economische Geschiedenis (TSEG) / The Low Countries Journal of Social and Economic History as: 'Dutch Coins for Asian growth.

questions in mind: What did Grotius actually know about the Portuguese Estado da \u00cdndia at the time of drafting the treatise between 1604 and 1606/8? What did he know about the Luso-Asian trading regime or Asian trading practices at large? Using the published correspondence of Grotius, archival documentation, manuscript fragments as well as unpublished reading notes and drafts, a case will be made that he had in fact few sources at his fingertips. This insight serves fundamentally to refute older assumptions, expounded notably by Robert Fruin and C.H. Alexandrowicz, that the young Grotius conducted independent research in the VOC company archives, or had immersed himself with Asian maritime codes or commercial practices.",

Havart described the various temples, mosues and other landmarks along the way, many of which are still to be found. His account is complemented by a detailed map of the road, made by his contemporary, Pieter Smith. Havart also described the lives of some Dutchmen who lived in the village of Nagulvancha, halfway along the road. In the process of making this documentary, we discovered the graves of two of these Nagulvancha- dwellers, One was the colourful Nicolaas Faber, who was as close to the villagers as he was to Hindu culture. Havart himself was more inclined to the Muslim culture of cosmopolitan Hyderabad, and a lover of Persian poetry. All of which goes to show that while prejudices were many in those days, they were more complex than the simple opposition between Europeans and non-Europeans through which many scholars today are inclined to see the period.\r\n\r\nThe documentary takes the shape of a road trip and explores the depths of self and other in an early phase of globalisation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 6791713, "asset_id": 899880, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 413948, "first_name": "Gijs", "last_name": "Kruijtzer", "domain_name": "leidenuni", "page_name": "GijsKruijtzer", "display_name": "Gijs Kruijtzer", "profile_url": "https://leidenuni.academia.edu/GijsKruijtzer?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/413948/244954/289589/s65_gijs.kruijtzer.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8516, "name": "Funerary Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Funerary_Archaeology?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11790, "name": "Early Modern Era", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Era?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22012, "name": "Architecture and Travel", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture_and_Travel?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29565, "name": "Persian Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persian_Culture?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 715619, "title": "Being \u2018Dutch\u2019 in the Indies.

He sent his personal secretary Leeuwenson overland with the ciphertext in his pocket and its key in his head. And with additional oral information that had to be delivered in person. Van Goens senior requested to conquer the whole of Sri Lanka, the island Ramanacoil and coastal area around it along with 1,000 more soldiers. This paper shows that by sending Leeuwenson, Van Goens senior wanted to repeat his most successful 'Vertoog' from 1655.

It was originally a spice trading organization, and its existence was precarious in its early years. But its governors soon began to think bigger. A decade after its foundation, they started to plan voyages to more adventurous places, notably Japan. Japan had silver, was cold in winter, and had no sheep, so was a perfect market for England's\nmain export, woollen cloth. The Company planned to add to its spice-runs, sailing back and forth to Japan, exchanging wool for silver. This could be done quickly and easily, over the top of Russia - or so the maps of the day suggested (these same maps also showed Japan twenty times too large, about the\nsize of India).\n\nKnowing the Spanish and Portuguese had got there before them, the Company prepared a special present to impress and win over their Japanese hosts. They chose as their first gift a silver telescope. The expedition carrying the telescope departed in 1611, and the Shogun was finally presented with the telescope in the name of King James I in 1613. It was the first telescope ever to leave Europe, and the first made as a presentation item. Before this voyage had even returned, the Company had\ndispatched another with an equally stunning cargo: nearly a hundred oil paintings.\n\nThis is the story of these two extraordinary cargoes: what they meant for the fortunes of the Company, what the choice of them says about the seventeenth century England from which they came, and what effect they had on the quizzical Asian rulers to whom they were given.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65515016, "asset_id": 44977388, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 478236, "first_name": "Thomas", "last_name": "Lockley", "domain_name": "nihon-u", "page_name": "ThomasLockley", "display_name": "Thomas Lockley", "profile_url": "https://nihon-u.academia.edu/ThomasLockley?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/478236/345561/29319536/s65_thomas.lockley.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 387, "name": "Japanese Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6001, "name": "Japanese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6027, "name": "Enlightenment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Enlightenment?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9690, "name": "Intellectual History of Enlightenment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intellectual_History_of_Enlightenment?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27396, "name": "European Enlightenment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/European_Enlightenment?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 32191, "name": "Japanese Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_Art_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 36327, "name": "Edo-period Japan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Edo-period_Japan?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 38383, "name": "Telescope Making", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Telescope_Making?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 49968, "name": "Tokugawa Ieyasu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tokugawa_Ieyasu?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 53190, "name": "Tokugawa Japan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tokugawa_Japan?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 58559, "name": "East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 75328, "name": "Japanese Foreign Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_Foreign_Policy?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 240914, "name": "King James I", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/King_James_I?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 323875, "name": "British East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 538474, "name": "Japanese foreign policies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_foreign_policies?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 678943, "name": "English east india company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_east_india_company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 825445, "name": "Tokugawa Shogunate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tokugawa_Shogunate?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 2635878, "name": "Christianity in Tokugawa Period", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christianity_in_Tokugawa_Period?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 2986618, "name": "Tokugawa period", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tokugawa_period?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 44952286, "title": "CFP - Decentering Asian Slavery in Early Modern European Colonial Empires: debates, definitions, and challenges (16th to 19th centuries)", "created_at": "2021-01-21T22:31:12.611-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44952286/CFP_Decentering_Asian_Slavery_in_Early_Modern_European_Colonial_Empires_debates_definitions_and_challenges_16th_to_19th_centuries_?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_44952286", "summary": "Call for Papers for the V International Conference on Frontiers of Humanity and Beyond: Towards new critical understandings of borders (21-23 July 2021, online and in-person event)\n\nSubmissions: from 10 January 2021 to 28 February 2021\n\nRegistration and submissions: http://chamconference2021.fcsh.unl.pt/call-for-papers/\n\nPanel abstract:\nSince the early 2000s, a number of scholars have been writing and publishing works analyzing the presence of South, Southeast, and East Asians enslaved by Europeans in the early modern Americas and Europe, as well as in the waters between the Indian and the Pacific oceans under the rule of a variety of different powers: Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Mughal, Persian, Chinese, Japanese, Moluccan, and others. The panel wishes to invite contributions from scholars interested in the enslavement of Asians by Europeans in the early modern age. Some of the possibilities include the following: How were local forms of human bondage used by European historical actors? How did local and imported notions of labor, dependence, subalternity, and coercion interact in the encounters of Europeans with Asians? What social and legal categories were created and transformed in societies under and beyond the jurisdiction of colonial and ecclesiastical powers in order to respond to the demand for labor in Goa, Kochi, Ormuz, Batavia, Pegu, Malacca, Manila, Macau, Canton or Nagasaki? How can local scholarship contribute to the understanding of the enslavement of Asians by Europeans? Is the violence suffered by enslaved Black Africans in North and South American plantations comparable to the violence endured in households dominated by Europeans in Asia?

Founded by Queen Elizabeth I on December 31st 1600, this joint-stock company, originally conceived to import spices and silk from the islands of Southeast Asia, became, during the course of the 18th century, the main tool of British colonial expansion in the Indian sub-continent, until its liquidation in 1858. In the 17th century, though, it still was, essentially, a company of \u201cadventurers\u201d trying to challenge the Portuguese and Dutch merchants in the East-Indies spice race. On the basis of the assumption that to decide by majority means to decide democratically, this essay aims at reconsidering the supposed democracy of the business corporation EIC, by way of the enforcement of the majority principle in modern England. It focuses on three issues: overview of the historiography devoted to the topic; description of the rooting of the principle in England (courts of justice, Parliament and legal-political doctrine, with a particular focus on Locke\u2019s thought); analysis of the development of the voting systems within the EIC in the time-frame 1600-1700. We will see that it was possible to define the EIC as a \u201cdemocratic\u201d organization, but only at the beginning of its very long history.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63954811, "asset_id": 43654226, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 742813, "first_name": "Stefania", "last_name": "Gialdroni", "domain_name": "unipd", "page_name": "StefaniaGialdroni", "display_name": "Stefania Gialdroni", "profile_url": "https://unipd.academia.edu/StefaniaGialdroni?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/742813/253277/96564758/s65_stefania.gialdroni.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6406, "name": "History of Democracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Democracy?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 58559, "name": "East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 201335, "name": "Joint stock companies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Joint_stock_companies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 323875, "name": "British East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 465609, "name": "Majority principle", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Majority_principle?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1584828, "name": "History of commercial law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_commercial_law?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 43208984, "title": "(2020) The intertidal springs near the 'Vergulde Draak' 1656 wreck site, Western Australia: hydrogeological characteristics and archaeological significance", "created_at": "2020-05-30T21:11:31.726-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43208984/_2020_The_intertidal_springs_near_the_Vergulde_Draak_1656_wreck_site_Western_Australia_hydrogeological_characteristics_and_archaeological_significance?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_43208984", "summary": "On 28 April 1656, the Vergulde Draak was shipwrecked on the Western Australian shore after it struck a reef north of the present-day town of Seabird. This article presents the results of an investigation in the vicinity of the wreck site to identify any potable water resources for the sustenance of the 68 survivors. From historical documents it is known that hardly any provisions could be rescued from the ship, so the survivors were reliant on finding water on land. There is no surface water in the immediate vicinity of the wreck. The chemical characteristics of three intertidal springs, as well as the Indian Ocean, were documented. Enough freshwater discharged from two of the three springs to cause a decrease of the salinity and pH, and an increase of the temperature, of the ocean water over a distance along the shore of 100 m. The chloride concentrations of the springs ranged between 3 and 6.5 g/L, and the shipwreck survivors might have resorted to drinking this brackish water. It is also possible that they collected rainwater or tried to dig a well in the dunes, where slightly brackish groundwater was found during the present study. Only future archaeological discoveries can provide certainty, but, albeit suboptimal, the beach offered at least some water resources for a survivor camp.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 712903, "first_name": "Wendy", "last_name": "van Duivenvoorde", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "WendyVanDuivenvoorde", "display_name": "Wendy van Duivenvoorde", "profile_url": "https://flinders.academia.edu/WendyVanDuivenvoorde?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/712903/254737/7962015/s65_wendy.van_duivenvoorde.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2549, "name": "Hydrology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hydrology?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2795, "name": "Landscape Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Landscape_Archaeology?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6951, "name": "Groundwater", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Groundwater?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8724, "name": "17th-Century Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th-Century_Studies?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 26606, "name": "17th Century Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 26849, "name": "Age of Exploration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Age_of_Exploration?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 29709, "name": "Underwater Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Underwater_Archaeology?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 48820, "name": "Shipwrecks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shipwrecks?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 90931, "name": "Western Australia-History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Western_Australia-History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 143607, "name": "Maritime Cultural Landscapes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Cultural_Landscapes?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 157160, "name": "Maritime and Underwater Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_and_Underwater_Archaeology?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 271756, "name": "Western Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Western_Australia?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 368448, "name": "Seafaring", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Seafaring?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 383271, "name": "Shipwreck Survivors", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shipwreck_Survivors?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 499946, "name": "Maritime Cultural Landscape and Seascapes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Cultural_Landscape_and_Seascapes?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 583743, "name": "Dutch Golden Age", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_Golden_Age?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 41627962, "title": "Historical aspects of supernumerary anatomical structures in arm and hand", "created_at": "2020-01-14T10:57:21.098-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41627962/Historical_aspects_of_supernumerary_anatomical_structures_in_arm_and_hand?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_41627962", "summary": "In nonhuman primates and their predecessors, the presence of such supernumerary muscles as the contrahentes muscles and extensor digitorum profundus muscle may be quite normal, but in human anatomy most of these muscle layers disappear during ontogeny.

Another example of this, namely supernumerary digital rays in the hand, better known as the Ellis-van Creveld (EVC) syndrome or postaxial polydactyly, is then discussed. First depicted in 1670, this genetic condition did persist by inheritance, in the offspring of 17th and 18th century Mennonite migrants, fleeing from Switzerland and the Palatinate.  \nCurrently described in Amish and Brasilian families, EVC syndrome also occurs in some Western Australian Aboriginal families.  Some members of the first Mennonite refugee group, who arrived in Holland in April / May 1710 may have joined the crew of the Dutch East India ship \u201cZuytdorp\u201d during the next year.

research on Japan was not the result of a long term vision. It was born in Batavia after other plans to settle down had failed. His application for the post at Dejima was supported by old and new friends in the Dutch East India Company. Many of them were motivated to help him out of this impasse not only through friendship. They also saw in Kaempfer a scholar capable of conducting extensive research on problems in which they had an interest. As in many other aspects of Kaempfer's Japan project, his investigations concerning Japanese plants and drugs were strongly influenced by questions that had circulated among curious men in Batavia and their counterparts in Europe. Kaempfer, who before his arrival in Batavia knew virtually nothing about Japan, obviously established a link into this circle. His descriptions of plants and drugs in the \"Amoenitates Exoticae\" (1712) and his manuscript \"Heutiges Japan\", as well as his notes, clearly indicate that he was fully aware of the current state of knowledge. As three examples of plants and drugs considered by his partners to be of special importance show, Kaempfer was not a lone pioneer on uncharted paths. His research and his writings fit neatly into the context of previous publications and questions. On the basis of the information that he collected in Japan, he attempts to arrange, to clarify and, as far as possible, to add new details. Even when he does not explicitly refer to specific persons, he nevertheless reacts to their opinions.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59232765, "asset_id": 39113337, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33051498, "first_name": "Wolfgang", "last_name": "Michel-Zaitsu", "domain_name": "kyushu-u", "page_name": "WolfgangMichelZaitsuW\u30df\u30d2\u30a7\u30eb", "display_name": "Wolfgang Michel-Zaitsu", "profile_url": "https://kyushu-u.academia.edu/WolfgangMichelZaitsuW%E3%83%9F%E3%83%92%E3%82%A7%E3%83%AB?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33051498/10754105/25305854/s65_wolfgang.michel-zaitsu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6727, "name": "Early Modern (Japanese History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Japanese_History_?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23954, "name": "History of Medicine in Japan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Medicine_in_Japan?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 36327, "name": "Edo-period Japan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Edo-period_Japan?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 57524, "name": "Scientists, Naturalists, Travelers and Explorers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Scientists_Naturalists_Travelers_and_Explorers?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 176163, "name": "Early Modern Travellers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Travellers?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1325736, "name": "History of Western Studies In Japan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Western_Studies_In_Japan?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1347714, "name": "Dejima", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dejima?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 38013795, "title": "Chapter 9, Tropenmuseum \u2013 Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen, Amsterdam", "created_at": "2018-12-20T01:53:32.837-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38013795/Chapter_9_Tropenmuseum_Nationaal_Museum_van_Wereldculturen_Amsterdam?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_38013795", "summary": "In 2006, during preparation for a small exhibition of Oceanic clubs at Amsterdam\u2019s Tropenmuseum (Museum of the Tropics), curator David van Duuren and I rediscovered the interesting origins of eleven clubs from the Pacific that had been part of the collection since the museum\u2019s founding.

A group of Japan-related nineteenth-century maps are analysed in terms of the various ways in which they can be related to specific encounters between historical actors. Their significance is enhanced by the fact that they bear traces of their use, thereby allowing the reconstruction of the material processes through which geographical knowledge was exchanged through social networks.\n     This study seeks to bring new insights to aspects of the movements of knowledge in early modernity from a non-Eurocentric perspective, by rethinking cartifacts\nas integral parts of an intellectual conversation about geographical knowledge. The study of knowledge transfer in early modernity has been dominated by postcolonial theory that emphasizes the agency of the colonial subject. However, in the case of geographical knowledge on Northeast Asia, a horizontal power relationship was at work, relying on informal exchanges in which the materiality of maps played an\nimportant role. Although the Sinocentric tradition provided the social protocols, Sinocentrism was concomitantly undermined by these exchanges.\nCartifacts circulated in an intermediary zone of civility where different modes of knowledge could be literally put side by side. These knowledge vehicles were\nalways on the move, never reaching a fixed destination. Within this process, the dynamics of knowledge exchange was shaped far less by Western science and its search for objectivity than by transcultural social interactions between peers. In this way, the examination of maps in the Leiden University Library collections \nenables the configuration of an alternative model for knowledge exchange.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3154596, "first_name": "Radu", "last_name": "Leca", "domain_name": "hkbu", "page_name": "RaduLeca", "display_name": "Radu Leca", "profile_url": "https://hkbu.academia.edu/RaduLeca?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3154596/1036788/93615366/s65_radu.leca.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 280, "name": "Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cartography?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 387, "name": "Japanese Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5527, "name": "Knowledge sharing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Knowledge_sharing?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6001, "name": "Japanese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 6878, "name": "History of Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Cartography?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 803916, "name": "Leiden University", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Leiden_University?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1013563, "name": "Asia Europe Cultural Cooperation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asia_Europe_Cultural_Cooperation?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 2511908, "name": "Cartifact", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cartifact?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 37527751, "title": "Dutch East India Company Shipbuilding -- Chapter 8 (Analysis)", "created_at": "2018-10-04T00:28:54.162-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37527751/Dutch_East_India_Company_Shipbuilding_Chapter_8_Analysis_?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_37527751", "summary": "Eight months into its maiden voyage to the Indies, the Dutch East India Company\u2019s Batavia sank on 4 June 1629 on Morning Reef in the Houtman Abrolhos off the western coast of Australia.

Cornelis\u2019s text is leading in the analysis and is presented more or less chronological. To be able to distinguish the two authors Cornelis\u2019s text is shown in the analysis with an indentation. Both texts in old Dutch are directly followed by a translation which stays as close as possible to the original text.\n\nThe perspective from which the two books are viewed is a practical one. The questions \u201cWhat did it look like\u201d? and \u201cHow did they do it\u201d? provide the basis. Subject is the establishment of the shape of the hull and if a team of skilled shipwrights would read the text they should be able to build the described ship. The reconstruction of a ship with a length of 155 feet from stem to stern provides the thread in the analysis. This length is chosen because Cornelis provides two comprehensive certers, one of a ship of 155 feet built in 1664 and one of 154 built in 1667 where he gives an enormous amount of information of these closely related and comparable ships. The text is supported by a computer reconstruction in 3D which creates on its own terms the need for precise dimensions and appearances. The text is adapted as new insights emerge and/or additional information is generated for example by discussion and suggestions from people who have read the text and comment on it. I have deliberately chosen this form because it always broadens and deepens my own judgment and insight and this will be beneficial to the text. Nothing is ever really finished.\n\nThe place where to find the quoted passages in the original books is in Cornelis\u2019s case given by a page and a line for example (p.1, l.2), in Nicolaes\u2019s case a column number is added (1 or 2) and the edition is mentioned, for example (p.1, c. 2, l. 3, 1671).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50814182, "asset_id": 30362309, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26011191, "first_name": "Jaap", "last_name": "Luiting", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JaapLuiting", "display_name": "Jaap Luiting", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JaapLuiting?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26011191/7141221/17399063/s65_jaap.luiting.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 26606, "name": "17th Century Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 93769, "name": "Shipbuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shipbuilding?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 406927, "name": "Dutch shipbuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_shipbuilding?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1126452, "name": "Nicolaes Witsen (1641-1717)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nicolaes_Witsen_1641-1717_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1924527, "name": "Cornelis van Yk", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cornelis_van_Yk?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 29584643, "title": "The Paper Company: The Impact of Paper on the Dutch East India Company in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries", "created_at": "2016-11-01T03:46:33.511-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29584643/The_Paper_Company_The_Impact_of_Paper_on_the_Dutch_East_India_Company_in_the_Seventeenth_and_Eighteenth_Centuries?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_29584643", "summary": "This project investigates how paper, as a material medium, information storage device, and communications technology, facilitated, sustained, and impacted the Dutch East India Company (Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC). I consult the VOC\u2019s rich seventeenth- and eighteenth-century archival collections to uncover how the Company obtained, employed, and preserved paper. The project hypothesizes that paper, as a material object, fundamentally influenced the VOC\u2019s operations. Vast amounts of paper were crucial to obtaining, managing, utilizing, and archiving essential information and knowledge, which was the cornerstone of the Company\u2019s politics, trade, diplomacy, and warfare. Simultaneously, the use of paper confronted the VOC with material constraints such as paper shortages and information overload, which impeded the Company's functioning. The exploration of paper offers a new way of studying the VOC and illuminates the material basis of Dutch political and commercial overseas expansion.\n\nGraduate School of Humanities/The Groningen Research Centre for the Study of Culture funded PhD-project (University of Groningen/Rijksuniversiteit Groningen)\n\nSupervisors:\nProf. Dr. R.M.

And the outward seabound journey of a literary character was found to echo explorations of exotic islands and illegal trading. \n\nThrough such examples, this study expands our understanding of the geographical imaginary, by exposing its permeation within a range of artistic productions. It thus reveals a \u2018floating world\u2019 production more in tune with the dynamics and materiality of global trade than previously thought.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors":

Hoe leefden ze daar en wat weten we eigenlijk van hun opvattingen over de exotische streken waar ze vertoefden? Hoe keken zij naar de mensen die zij \u2018aan de overkant\u2019 ontmoetten? Waren deze reizigers en emigranten ge\u00efnteresseerd in andere culturen? Begrepen zij iets van de andere religies, gewoonten en samenlevingen waarin zij terechtkwamen? Of ging het hen alleen maar om het najagen van het eigenbelang voor hun bazen of voor zichzelf.\r\n\r\nDe Nederlanders die we in de bronnen tegenkomen brachten hun eigen opvattingen, ja, begrijpelijkerwijs, hun cultuur- en groepsgebonden oordelen mee. Die klinken vaak door in denigrerende of jaloerse opmerkingen. Maar gelukkig zijn er ook voorbeelden van waardering en samenwerking: plaatselijke informanten speelden bijvoorbeeld een belangrijke rol in de overdracht van kennis van andere culturen.\r\n\r\nDeze bundel levert een kostelijke verzameling verhalen op over de vraag hoe Nederlanders en \u2018zij die aan de overkant leefden\u2019 over en weer naar elkaar keken en elkaar de maat namen.\r\n\r\nInhoud\r\n\r\nVan tussenpersonen, tolken en trotse heersers: inheemse stemmen uit het verre verleden van het eiland Formosa\r\nLeonard Bluss\u00e9\r\n\r\nZingen voor de shogun.

major harbours around the China Seas which may have lasted for a millennium , Tayouan bay did not become a prominent harbour until the VOC (Dutch East India Company) arrived there in 1624. In this article, the author intends to clarify the drivers behind its sudden rise. The rise of Tayouan harbour is a result of multiple interactions of different forces displayed on a specific geopolitical terrain which was created by two large-scale military confrontations in Northeast and Southeast Asia. The Imjin war (1592-1598) between China, Korea and Japan caused a political split between China and Japan, while the expanding demands in commerce compelled traders of both countries to conduct transit trade in Southeast Asian harbours. When in 1617 the Japanese Shogunate eased its pursuit of direct trade with China via Taiwan, the Fukien authorities and Japanese Red Seal (Go-shuin) operators reached a tacit agreement to keep Tayouan bay in a \u2018stateless\u2019 status. In the same year, a strong typhoon suddenly struck the Philippines Islands, and destroyed most of the Iberian fleet that originally planned to sweep the Dutch fleet from Asia once and for all. This incidental vacuum of Iberian naval forces allowed the VOC to blockade Iberian transit harbours like Macau and Manila and to harass Chinese junks bound to these harbours. In response to this threat, overseas Chinese traders residing in Japan thus planned to exploit Tayouan bay as an exceptional transit harbour. In 1622, the VOC aimed to take over Macau but failed; instead of mounting further attacks on Macau, Company forces occupied the Pescadores in order to gain access to the Chinese market. After their request for free trade was denied by the Chinese Ming court, the Dutch adapted to the strategy of overseas Chinese in Japan, and retreated to Tayouan bay to engage in the transit trade.

Modern criticism of his work to a large degree revolves around accusations of plagiarism of naturalist Georg Rumphius. This criticism, however, does not take into account early eighteenth-century notions of plagiarism and systems of referencing. This article tries to read the shortcomings (from our perspective) of Valentyn\u2019s system of referencing against the background of shifting ideas about scholarly behaviour and referencing within the Republic of Letters around 1700. The argument of the paper focusses both on Valentyn\u2019s use of Rumphius and his defence against potential accusations of plagiarism in the case of his assertions about the possible location of biblical Ophir in the book of Kings. It is concluded that Valentyn found himself in an ambiguous discursive position. Although he was\r\nacquainted with the stricter guidelines for scholarly referencing in the Republic of Letters, in which he held at most an outsider\u2019s position, at the same time he remained caught up in a historiographical discourse which discouraged explicit attribution\r\nand, in the case of travel writing, even allowed large scale plagiarism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

"\"Travel narratives have been one of the primary means by which Europeans learned about the rest of the world. This paper examines how travel narratives concerning the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa) from 1649 to 1690 utilized specific images of the Khoikhoi to serve either Dutch imperial intentions or a larger European cultural project. In both cases, writing was utilized as a technology of representation: texts served as tools in the construction of a Euro-managed Khoikhoi identity.\r\n\r\nThe paper is based on sailors' accounts. Between 1649 and 1690 at least eighty-eight reports of the Cape of Good Hope were written by sailors, many of them quoted by later academics and imperial strategists. This paper focuses on the most popular and representative of these writings. It first looks at how Khoikhoi were represented as \"strategic shepherds\", as herders who were seen as important assets in the Dutch colonial establishment at the Cape. It then investigates how travellers tapped into and enhanced the trope of the godless savage, extending this rather popular stereotype to Khoikhoi as part of European understanding of the \"other\". Finally it examines how local Cape peoples were valued as ethnographic specimens.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86107, "asset_id": 164945, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

knowledge production. Post-colonial historiography has stressed the role of non-European actors in the process of creat- ing knowledge on nature in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Research on spaces of knowledge creation, actors, networks, and mediality have received attention in recent historiography. Individual initiatives and cross-cultural contacts and net- works facilitated dissemination of knowledge. This is particularly true for knowledge from the colonies that travelled long distances. The East India companies provided a conduit for the movement of people, books, plants, and animals between Asia and the Low Countries. Knowledge depended on the media of its representation that were often subject to change.

In recent research, empires are seen more as a collection of nodes than structures of a centre with peripheries. Each node can be part of several networks, which contribute to the shaping of that node. When applied to the Cape settlement this concept makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of Cape society and its residents. The Cape was a complex society in which several different groups lived together. Each of these experienced their environment in another manner influenced by the networks they were part of, and each of these made their own contribution to the shaping of the Cape settlement. This article focuses on the burgher group and especially those burghers from the middle and upper layers. These burghers were the ones who were mostly exposed to the many connections of the Cape with the Netherlands thro...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79060035, "asset_id": 68652160, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 304653, "first_name": "Teun", "last_name": "Baartman", "domain_name": "uct", "page_name": "TeunBaartman", "display_name": "Teun  Baartman", "profile_url": "https://uct.academia.edu/TeunBaartman?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/304653/75148/8541661/s65_teun.baartman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2089, "name": "Social Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Identity?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 174485, "name": "Cape Colony", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cape_Colony?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 384842, "name": "South Africa history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Africa_history?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 518508, "name": "Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 68369914, "title": "Sporen van het slavernijverleden in Groningen: Gids voor Stad en Ommeland", "created_at": "2022-01-15T23:41:35.658-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/68369914/Sporen_van_het_slavernijverleden_in_Groningen_Gids_voor_Stad_en_Ommeland?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_68369914", "summary": "A guidebook on the traces of the history of slavery and the slave trade in the Dutch province of Groningen. Walking and cycling routes along 57 locations. Abstract in Dutch: De Gouden Eeuw in Nederland had een keerzijde in de vorm van slavenhandel en slavernij. Dat gold ook voor Groningen, waar een eigen Kamer van de West-Indische Compagnie werd opgericht met een scheepswerf aan de Noorderhaven. Van daaruit voeren schepen naar de Afrikaanse kusten om tot slaaf gemaakte Afrikanen op te kopen en ze naar de overzijde van de Atlantische Oceaan te verschepen. Vooraanstaande Groningers investeerden in de Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC), de West-Indische Compagnie (WIC) en in plantages in Suriname en op de Antillen. Na het afschaffen van de slavernij werden velen van hen of hun nazaten in Nederland financieel gecompenseerd voor het verlies van hun slaven. Deze lucratieve geschiedenis speelde zich niet alleen af overzee; zij werkte ook door in de stad Groningen en Ommelanden. Sporen van het koloniale verleden en de slavernij die daarmee gepaard ging, zijn nog steeds aanwijsbaar. Het statige Calmershuis in de Oude Boteringestraat behoorde toe aan Thomas van Seeratt, die voorafgaand aan een glansrijke carri\u00e8re als commies-provinciaal in Groningen zijn fortuin vergaarde als slavenhandelaar in dienst van de WIC. Ook buiten de stad, op borgen en in kerken, vinden we sporen van het slavernijverleden. Op de borg Nienoord in Leek bevindt zich een reproductie van het portret van de 17e eeuwse jonkvrouwe Anna van Ewsum in het gezelschap van een zwarte bediende.

The article suggests their views challenge traditional periodizations about the growth of enlightened hopes and capitalist principles in the Spanish world. The article concludes by suggesting that, despite the existence of conflicting political expectations, early eighteenth-century Spanish officials in Lima and Madrid turned to bargaining and Enlightenment ideas to facilitate trans-imperial negotiation.

They not only brought Chinese products, but also people, language, and customs to foreign lands. However, scholarship on Hokkien merchants has mostly paid attention to the family of Koxinga (Cheng Cheng-kung), or the so-called Overseas Chinese in the modern era. Both approaches are entwined with the Chinese nationalism developed in the last century. This study, however, attempts to elucidate the experiences of five lesser-known 17th century Hokkien merchants to elaborate on the aspect of multinational cooperation in early modern East Asia. The five merchants I examine are from neighborhoods situated on the northern bank of the Jioulong River, and share the same surname Koeh \u90ed. The proximity of their hometowns and identical surnames suggest that they may have been relatives, but a reliable genealogical source is unavailable. These Koeh merchants went overseas and cooperated with rulers in foreign lands to build their businesses in Japan, Dutch Formosa, and Dutch Indonesia. Their enterprises are still remembered by the locals of these locations. By reviewing the activities of these Koeh merchants, this study intends to go beyond the Sino-centric view, and proposes an inclusive historiography that addresses their overseas enterprises, homeland connections, and multi-national cooperatives that enabled their businesses to flourish. I also emphasize that Taiwan, Japan, and Indonesia were equally foreign (hoan) to the Hokkien people in the 17th century. Therefore, as a result of Hokkien colonization since the time of the Koehs, Taiwan can offer an alternative perspective for reconsidering the activities of Hokkien merchants in early modern globalization. This study thereby recovers the history of these merchants from the single-national perspective, which I believe is unsuitable in this further globalizing world.\n\nKeywords: Hokkien merchants, Overseas Chinese, co-colonialism, Dutch East India Company (VOC), Greater-Hokkien cultural sphere", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57509020, "asset_id": 37535135, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14875171, "first_name": "Hung-yi", "last_name": "Chien", "domain_name": "ncku", "page_name": "HungyiChien", "display_name": "Hung-yi Chien", "profile_url": "https://ncku.academia.edu/HungyiChien?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14875171/13981103/21168803/s65_hung-yi.chien.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 43434, "name": "Overseas Chinese", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Overseas_Chinese?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1340690, "name": "Hokkien", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hokkien?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37318512, "title": "Potts 2004.

Having spent most of the 1970s excavating and researching the Batavia shipwreck, and then fi nally overseeing reconstruction of the recovered surviving portion of the ship's hull aft er a lengthy conservation process, I was aware that the details of hull construction had not been properly documented. At the Fift h International Symposium on Boat and Ship Archaeology in Amsterdam in 1988, I presented a paper on the planking-fi rst construction of Batavia's hull. Th is came as a bit of a shock to many of the conference participants, as it was generally accepted that planking-fi rst, or shell-fi rst, construction had died out by the seventeenth century. At that time, few seventeenth-century ships had been excavated archaeologically, and no other hull structure from a Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC) ship had been excavated. Subsequent examination of contemporary paintings and illustrations revealed that this system was widely used, at least in the Netherlands, and particularly by the VOC. However, the thought of documenting the Batavia hull in great detail was for me quite daunting. What I needed was a researcher well versed in nautical archaeology and wooden ship construction who was also capable of studying Dutch archival material. In June 2002, I ran into Wendy van Duivenvoorde at the Bodrum airport in Turkey. We were both on our way to the International Symposium and Workshop on Underwater Archaeology, hosted by Turkey's Ministry of Culture and the Institute of Nautical Archaeology (INA) in Bodrum and at nearby Pabu\u00e7 Burnu. Wendy and I had worked together the previous summer at Tekta\u015f Burnu, Turkey, on the fi nal season of INA's Classical shipwreck excavation and later in Galle, Sri Lanka, on the VOC Avondster project. Our concurrent arrival in Bodrum, from opposite sides of the world, was truly serendipitous, and I was not about to waste this opportune encounter. As we walked together through the airport lobby, chatting casually and catching up on what we had been up to since we last saw each other, I asked Wendy about her long-term plans. When she replied that she was somewhat frustrated in fi nding a ship-related research project, I wasted no time in making a pitch. Here was a Dutch maritime archaeologist eager for a research project, and I had just the thing. We were still making our way through customs when I told her of the Batavia hull remains that needed studying, as well as related materials from three other VOC shipwrecks in the Western Australian (WA) Museum. I off ered her not only the material for study but also a position at the museum. We collected our luggage and headed off to the conference, all the while discussing possible research plans, specifi cs about the archaeological material, living in Fremantle, and sundry other matters. Upon her return to Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, Wendy developed and submitted a formal research proposal for the project. Aft er receiving approval, she spent the following two years conducting historical and archival research but also visited the museum on two occasions to begin the recording and sampling program. In 2006, Wendy fi nally relocated to Fremantle and started work as an assistant curator in the WA Museum's Department of Maritime Archaeology. It took another two years and count", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 712903, "first_name": "Wendy", "last_name": "van Duivenvoorde", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "WendyVanDuivenvoorde", "display_name": "Wendy van Duivenvoorde", "profile_url": "https://flinders.academia.edu/WendyVanDuivenvoorde?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/712903/254737/7962015/s65_wendy.van_duivenvoorde.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 92, "name": "Naval Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Naval_Architecture?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30137, "name": "Nautical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nautical_Archaeology?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36745206, "title": "Patani as a Site of Cultural Mediation and the Encounter with Netherlandish \u2018Popular\u2019 Prints in Early Modern Asia (HNA Conference, Ghent 2018)", "created_at": "2018-05-30T01:00:35.378-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36745206/Patani_as_a_Site_of_Cultural_Mediation_and_the_Encounter_with_Netherlandish_Popular_Prints_in_Early_Modern_Asia_HNA_Conference_Ghent_2018_?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_36745206", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56689959, "asset_id": 36745206, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11427322, "first_name": "Daan", "last_name": "van Heesch", "domain_name": "kbr", "page_name": "DaanvanHeesch", "display_name": "Daan van Heesch", "profile_url": "https://kbr.academia.edu/DaanvanHeesch?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11427322/3331089/22376211/s65_daan.van_heesch.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 15054, "name": "Early modern cross-cultural encounters", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_modern_cross-cultural_encounters?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23426, "name": "Prints (Art History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prints_Art_History_?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26606, "name": "17th Century Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29426, "name": "Cultural Exchange", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Exchange?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43242, "name": "Early Modern print culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_print_culture?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 282228, "name": "Cultural mediation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_mediation?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 416979, "name": "Global Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Art_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 903935, "name": "South Thailand, Patani, History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Thailand_Patani_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 910718, "name": "Patani history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Patani_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 972366, "name": "Transmediality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transmediality?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1383357, "name": "Pattani", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pattani?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 35955328, "title": "The rise and fall of the Dutch in Dhaka", "created_at": "2018-02-18T23:23:40.054-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35955328/The_rise_and_fall_of_the_Dutch_in_Dhaka?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_35955328", "summary": "India has always been considered a haven for various businesses by European traders.

Therefore, this study is partly based on the experiences of Dutch East India Company servants, who regularly visited the south Indian courts of Ikkeri, Tanjavur, Madurai, and Ramnad.\n\nThis presentation addresses the following issues: What were the manifestations and functions of court protocol and diplomatic insult at these courts? How did protocol and insult mirror or shape other facets of court politics? To what extent was Indo-Dutch diplomacy based on south Indian conventions?

It partly serves as a practical and more specific counterpart of the Literature Seminar. It addresses archival issues in the context of a 17th- and 18th-century Dutch-Asian commercial enterprise. While the VOC records formally comprised business administration, in practice they also functioned as a giant repository of valuable and secret information on all sorts of events in early-modern Asia.\r\n\r\nThe remaining VOC records comprise various archives and collections, consisting of many different types or even \"genres\" of documents, including, for example, memoirs, reports of embassies, and maps. Further, they partly overlap with materials that fall outside the confines of these records, but are closely related to them, such as private papers, missionary records, travel accounts, and even works of art. These diverse materials were produced with different purposes, are composed and organised in different ways, and present information from different perspectives.\r\n\r\nThis course considers and compares all these sources from both an archival and a historiographical point of view. The central question is: was there a specific \u201carchival VOC mentality\u201d with regard to the way records were created and information was processed? Therefore, this seminar looks for similarities and differences between, on the one hand, the VOC archives and, on the other hand, archives of contemporaneous Dutch institutions as well as other European overseas trading companies.

In the absence of a pliable indigenous population the mainstay of its labour force was slavery. Historians have long recognized the diverse regions of the Indian Ocean world from which slaves were obtained, but precise enumeration of the town\u2019s enslaved population has been hampered by sources that combine the urban population with the rural hinterland. This paper uses new data obtained from household inventories to show how the main sources of Cape Town\u2019s slave population shifted from South Asia in the early parts of the century, to Southeast Asia and then to the Southwest Indian Ocean and especially eastern Africa by the time of the abolition of the slave trade in 1807.  The paper then argues that both the Indian and the African roots of Cape Town\u2019s slave heritage have been obscured by the strong emphasis in popular perception and memory on \u2018Malay\u2019 slaves from Southeast Asia and analyses the political dynamics behind such a distortion.

Thanks to this voyage, we can learn a lot on the political and economic situation of the Sakalava people of Madagascar as well as that of the VOC. Together with other data compiled from similar expeditions, this voyage allows us to better understand the commercial interactions between Dutch merchants and Malagasy sovereigns during a poorly known period when maritime trade with Europeans was developing rapidly.

They called themselves Sultan and on public occasions they appeared in garments fashioned on Persianate clothing. Both adaptations exemplified efforts to connect to the dominant Indo-Islamic world. From Vijayanagara\u2019s fragmentation in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries new kingdoms arose. We may wonder to what extent those succeeding polities adopted politico-cultural practices from its parental state and\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014from Persianate courts. With that question in mind, this paper compares dynastic titles used in Vijayanagara itself and in several of its successor states. This is done chiefly on the basis of inscriptions commissioned by these rulers and documents received from them by the Dutch East India Company. The focus lies on two aspects of such titles: claims to imperial status and Persianate elements. It appears that the various dynasties substantially differed from one another with regard to both of these facets, reflecting divergent political circumstances and ambitions.",

Yet these same officials gave official titles to Chinese pirates as part of a \"summon and appease\" (zhaofu) policy in the hope that the pirates would abandon crime for more civilized pursuits. After a decade of frustrations, the Dutch decided to take a page from the pirates' playbook and tried to unite the pirates to attack China. The pirate war against China did not go well for the Dutch, who failed to unite the pirates under their leadership. Nonetheless, they did eventually reach a modus vivendi with Chinese officials and began trading regularly with China. Yet after the collapse of the Ming Empire in 1644, the Dutch increasingly suffered competition from an ex-pirate organization: the powerful Zheng family. Its leader, Zheng Chenggong, created a loyalist state with maritime pretensions. So long as the company was competing against private Chinese seamen who lacked state support, it was able to hold its own. But once these seamen were united in the framework of a maritime Chinese state, the company could not prevail. \n\u8bd1\u8005\u6848\uff1a\u539f\u6587\u520a\u4e8eJournal of World History 15. 4 (2004): 415-444\u3002\n\u672c\u6587\u7cfb2006\u5e74\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u4ea7\u7269\uff0c\u5f53\u65f6\u672c\u7279\u5229\uff08Jerry H.

By 1795 their number had grown to almost fifteen thousand. The original free burghers shared the same socio-cultural background and were uniformly poor. Yet in the course of the eighteenth century they developed into a stratified society with a clearly identifiable elite. Hitherto this development had been ascribed to capital accumulation in the form of land and slaves, with a focus on the settled arable farmers. This thesis challenges these arguments by applying the theoretical concept of entrepreneurship to the history of the 198 individuals who served as alcohol pachters (lease holders) in Cape Town between 1680 and 1795. The thesis argues that a study of their economic and social activities leads to greater conceptual clarity and a better understanding of the way in which social mobility operated. This study reveals how intertwined economic success was with social factors; and traces the changing uses and functions of kinship and social capital in VOC Cape Town. It demonstrates the importance of the urban free burghers to the Cape economy and the ways in which this group was linked to the rural free burghers.\r\n\r\nThe first chapter treats the origins and operation of the alcohol pacht (lease) system and its contribution to the Cape economy. This is followed by a prosopographical analysis of all 198 of the alcohol pachters. Chapter three presents the biography of Hendrik Oostwald Eksteen as a vehicle with which to present the theoretical concepts attended on entrepreneurship, which are employed in the rest of the thesis. Chapter four illustrates the importance of social capital and kinship to what was still a largely immigrant society in the 1730s, while chapter five traces the changes which had occurred by the 1770s. These two chapters also demonstrate the ways in which the urban and rural elites coalesced over time. The final chapter shows to what extent the economic success of pachters was translated into other forms of power.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37729179, "asset_id": 12576381, "asset_type":

honderden VOC-dienaren tientallen Aziatische hoven, van India tot de Molukken, van Japan tot de Malediven, en van Perzi\u00eb tot Thailand. Wat die gezanten daar beleefden en observeerden, kunnen we lezen in de vele bewaard gebleven verslagen van deze ambassades.\r\n\r\nDeze collegereeks inventariseert, analyseert en vergelijkt de diplomatieke missies van de VOC naar hoven in West-, Zuid-, Zuidoost-, en Oost- Azi\u00eb in de periode 1600-1800. Het college richt zich met name op de verschillen tussen deze missies en hoven, waarbij het zwaartepunt ligt op zulke aspecten als hofprotocol, geschenken, toegang tot heersers, onderhandelingspraktijken, diplomatieke schoffering en de rol van tussenpersonen, als ook op de belangen van de VOC, Eurocentrische opvattingen en de waarde van observaties van VOC-gezanten.\r\n\r\nElke student kiest tenminste twee hoven, focust op tenminste twee missies, en bestudeert en vergelijkt genoemde elementen op basis van zowel een onuitgegeven ambassadeverslag in het VOC-archief als secundaire literatuur.

Fashion in 1600-l780\u2019s, clearly represents the status and occupation of individuals in that society. Aspects of clothing, such as: fabric, materials, and aesthetic appeal all of which can give clues to the past existence of our colonial culture. Learned social behaviors, trade, and industry developed the evolution of fashion and dictated money flow. I believe to better understand societies of the past, it is ideal to focus on the individual their niche in the Williamsburg community by using their clothing to determine their past. I will use my method of classification to understand individuals of the past through: status, perception, and structure. Further research explained in this essay can offer theories to many questions. Moreover, to entirely visualize the full aspects of historic Williamsburg, looking at where these materials came from can paint a richer image into the past. \r\n\r\n2011", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32459685, "asset_id": 5288650, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1036315, "first_name": "Nicole", "last_name": "Cyrier", "domain_name": "ucl", "page_name": "NicoleCyrier", "display_name": "Nicole Cyrier", "profile_url": "https://ucl.academia.edu/NicoleCyrier?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1036315/1873277/28375728/s65_nicole.cyrier.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3180, "name": "International Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Trade?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 5255, "name": "History of Costume", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Costume?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 8878, "name": "Costume and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Costume_and_Identity?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 12420, "name": "Neoliberalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neoliberalism?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 13430, "name": "Social Exclusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Exclusion?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 23436, "name": "18th Century Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/18th_Century_Art?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 53166, "name": "Power", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Power?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 134282, "name": "Prestige", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prestige?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 311265, "name": "17th and 18th century European Decorative Arts and Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_and_18th_century_European_Decorative_Arts_and_Design?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 332622, "name": "Historic Williamsburg Va", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historic_Williamsburg_Va?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 2274505, "title": "Maggioranza, democrazia & the East India Company.

In this article these travel accounts are for the first time discussed together as a more or less coherent project of Couperus, focusing on the question to what degree his representation of the countries he visited was determined by an imaginative geography which he had constructed on the basis of texts, images and visits to exhibitions. His conception of a confrontation between a destructive Western Modernity and traditional \u2018Oriental\u2019 societies will appear to take a central place, without Couperus being able to free himself of a position as an accomplice in this conflict.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31994840, "asset_id": 4647680, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2686658, "first_name": "Siegfried", "last_name": "Huigen", "domain_name": "wroc", "page_name": "SiegfriedHuigen", "display_name": "Siegfried Huigen", "profile_url": "https://wroc.academia.edu/SiegfriedHuigen?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2686658/859513/36624605/s65_siegfried.huigen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1082, "name": "Travel Writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Travel_Writing?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21277, "name": "Travel Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Travel_Literature?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25988, "name": "Dutch Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_Literature?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 49917, "name": "Dutch History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 218722, "name": "Dutch overseas history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_overseas_history?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 4303213, "title": "Admiral Matelieff and the Beginnings of the Dutch Empire in Asia, 1605-15", "created_at": "2013-08-22T14:17:25.470-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4303213/Admiral_Matelieff_and_the_Beginnings_of_the_Dutch_Empire_in_Asia_1605_15?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_4303213", "summary": "Admiral Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge was a commander of one of the first fleets sent out in 1605 by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) proper.

With more than 1400 men at his disposal, Matelieff imposed a blockade on Portuguese Malacca in 1606, fought the Portuguese armada at sea, forged an enduring alliance with the Kingdom of Johor and Aceh, and founded the Dutch fort at Ternate. \r\nOn his return to the Netherlands in 1608 Matelieff penned a series of memorials recommending major changes in the way the Dutch organized their operations on the ground in Asia. Importantly, he recommended the founding of a permanent base and the appointment of a supreme authority, a Governor-General.  Matelieff also urged the forging of alliances with rulers in Asia to ensure ample supplies of spices and other goods for the company. Needless to say, these alliances were ostensibly also meant to contain the power and reach of the VOC\u2019s European competitors and enemies.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors":

He launched an attack on Portuguese Melaka in 1606 and signed landmark treaties with Johor and Ternate in the same year. On his return to the Netherlands in the autumn of 1608 he began to write a series of epistolary reports and memoranda which were received and carefully studied by leading policy makers in the Republic at the time, including Hugo Grotius and Jan van Oldenbarnevelt. This paper provides an overview of the materials that survive in Dutch archives and specifically delves into his evolving conclusions about security, trade, and diplomacy in Singapore, Batu Sawar and

In the section on Amboina, Valentyn devotes a large part of his text to natural history. From the selection of his material it is clear that his text is aimed at a public of amateurs, while he at the same time presents himself as an amateur natural historian. This attitude resulted in special attention to topics with a problematic epistemological status, such as sea people and birds of paradise. This article examines in particular the way Valentyn justifies his stance on these topics, and analyses his position within eighteenth-century discourse on natural history.

In the beginning and the conclusion, I will expose the way it advances the main themes of the volume. In fact, the people who backed these attempts promoted the production of a wide array of texts (mostly written projects and memoranda, and in one case a travel memoir), which set guidelines for a prospective naval and commercial expansion. There was a feedback process between these works and the different companies or expeditions that were started as a result of their circulation. Moreover, the characteristics of these texts, and the way they circulated, were heavily influenced both by the social and economic background of their producers, as well as by their expected readers. My essay, then, will show the importance that written plans and reports had in European trans-oceanic expansion, even in the cases in which this expansion was eventually aborted. After the introduction, my essay will describe the little-known history of these attempts, as well as the different texts that accompanied them. This part will not just be a review of the existing literature, but it will also include some unpublished results of the archival research I am currently undertaking for my PhD project. The second part of my essay will be devoted to a contextual analysis of these texts. First of all, I will sketch out the stylistic features of these works, and how they were connected (or not) to a pre-existing tradition. I will then focus on the social environment of these texts: I will look at their authors, who were mostly merchants, at their expected readers, i.e. the political \u00e9lites of Tuscany and Genoa, and I would analyse how their interactions shaped the production of these works. Finally, I will look at their contents. These include vindications of the usefulness of extra-European trade as such, which was supposed to enhance internal industrial production and improve the balance of payments, in a mercantilist perspective, as well as to gain international prestige. Moreover, these proposals tried to identify a comparative advantage for Tuscan and Genoese traders, and usually identified it in their relatively easier access to silver and coral. The texts produced in Tuscany and in Genoa shared some common characteristics, which were related to their formal similarities and to the global evolution of international commerce. However, they also differed on many important points, due to the distinct political and economic conditions of Genoa and Tuscany. Finally, in the last part of my essay, I will sum up my conclusions, and point out again the relevance of my work for the study of the role of written intelligence in the European overseas expansion.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12566230, "first_name": "Giorgio", "last_name": "Tosco", "domain_name": "eui", "page_name": "GiorgioTosco", "display_name": "Giorgio Tosco", "profile_url": "https://eui.academia.edu/GiorgioTosco?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12566230/3585517/10320468/s65_giorgio.tosco.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11446, "name": "History of Florence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Florence?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21277, "name": "Travel Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Travel_Literature?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 31622, "name": "Early joint stock shipping companies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_joint_stock_shipping_companies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52849, "name": "History of Commerce", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Commerce?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 254443, "name": "History of Genoa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Genoa?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 953669, "name": "Routledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Routledge?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 75434099, "title": "De Madagascar \u00e0 Sumatra\u00a0: une route n\u00e9gri\u00e8re peu commune.

Shipwreck timbers hold material evidence of the dynamic interplay of wood supplies, craftmanship, and evolving ship designs that helped shape the Early Modern world. Here we present the results of dendroarchaeological research carried out on Batavia\u2019s wreck timbers, currently on display at the Western Australian Shipwrecks Museum in Fremantle. Built in Amsterdam in 1628 CE and wrecked on its maiden voyage in June 1629 CE in Western Australian waters, Batavia epitomises Dutch East India Company (Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC) shipbuilding. In the 17th century, the VOC grew to become the first multinational trading enterprise, prompting the rise of the stock market and modern capitalism. Oak (Quercus sp.) was the preferred material for shipbuilding in northern and western Europe, and maritime nations struggled to ensure sufficient supplies to meet their needs and sustain their ever-growing mercantile fleets and networks. Our research illustrates the compatibility of dendrochronological studies with musealisation of shipwreck assemblages, and the results demonstrate that the VOC successfully coped with timber shortages in the early 17th century through diversification of timber sources (mainly Baltic region, L\u00fcbeck hinterland in northern Germany, and Lower Saxony in northwest Germany), allocation of sourcing regions to specific timber products (hull planks from the Baltic and L\u00fcbeck, framing elements from Lower Saxony), and skillful woodworking craftmanship (sapwood was removed from all timber elements). These strategies, combined with an innovative hull design and the use of wind-powered sawmills, allowed the Dutch to produce unprecedented numbers of ocean-going ships for long-distance voyaging and interregional trade in Asia, proving key to their success in 17th-century world trade.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 712903, "first_name": "Wendy", "last_name": "van

chapter will expand the paper I presented in Chatham, which analysed some texts related to the attempts at extra-European expansion that were promoted in the seventeenth century by the Republic of Genoa and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. In the beginning and the conclusion, I will expose the way it advances the main themes of the volume. In fact, the people who backed these attempts promoted the production of a wide array of texts (mostly written projects and memoranda, and in one case a travel memoir), which set guidelines for a prospective naval and commercial expansion. There was a feedback process between these works and the different companies or expeditions that were started as a result of their circulation. Moreover, the characteristics of these texts, and the way they circulated, were heavily influenced both by the social and economic background of their producers, as well as by their expected readers. My essay, then, will show the importance that written plans and reports had in European trans-oceanic expansion, even in the cases in which this expansion was eventually aborted.\nAfter the introduction, my essay will describe the little-known history of these attempts, as well as the different texts that accompanied them. This part will not just be a review of the existing literature, but it will also include some unpublished results of the archival research I am currently undertaking for my PhD project.\nThe second part of my essay will be devoted to a contextual analysis of these texts. First of all, I will sketch out the stylistic features of these works, and how they were connected (or not) to a pre-existing tradition. I will then focus on the social environment of these texts: I will look at their authors, who were mostly merchants, at their expected readers, i.e. the political \u00e9lites of Tuscany and Genoa, and I would analyse how their interactions shaped the production of these works. Finally, I will look at their contents. These include vindications of the usefulness of extra-European trade as such, which was supposed to enhance internal industrial production and improve the balance of payments, in a mercantilist perspective, as well as to gain international prestige. Moreover, these proposals tried to identify a comparative advantage for Tuscan and Genoese traders, and usually identified it in their relatively easier access to silver and coral. The texts produced in Tuscany and in Genoa shared some common characteristics, which were related to their formal similarities and to the global evolution of international commerce. However, they also differed on many important points, due to the distinct political and economic conditions of Genoa and Tuscany.\nFinally, in the last part of my essay, I will sum up my conclusions, and point out again the relevance of my work for the study of the role of written intelligence in the European overseas expansion.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12566230, "first_name": "Giorgio", "last_name": "Tosco", "domain_name": "eui", "page_name": "GiorgioTosco", "display_name": "Giorgio Tosco", "profile_url": "https://eui.academia.edu/GiorgioTosco?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12566230/3585517/10320468/s65_giorgio.tosco.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11446, "name": "History of Florence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Florence?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21277, "name": "Travel Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Travel_Literature?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 31622, "name": "Early joint stock shipping companies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_joint_stock_shipping_companies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52849, "name": "History of Commerce", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Commerce?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 254443, "name": "History of Genoa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Genoa?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 53196068, "title": "Pieter Adriaensz.

The Portuguese empire in Asia, the so\u2013called Estado da \u00cdndia, remained virtually intact until the beginning of the 1620s. However, as soon as the truce between the Iberian Union (1580\u20131640), of which Portugal was a part, and the Dutch Republic expired (in 1621), the Dutch United East India Company (VOC) was free to make a frontal attack. From mid-1630\u2019s, the Dutch attacked the core of the Estado da \u00cdndia in the western part of the Indian Ocean. They led a concentrated offensive against the Portuguese from their main base in Batavia, on Java Island. The resources of the Iberian Union were drained by the costly struggle on European scene, where the Thirty Years War raged. However, the Dutch pressure itself did not cause the collapse of Portuguese power in the East. The Dutch acted more like a catalyst, which prompted many Asian rulers to resist. Once the Portuguese lost their maritime superiority, lacked resources needed to defend their empire, because the majority of their revenues came from customs duties that they were no longer able to exact. The result was the collapse of the Estado da \u00cdndia and the establishment of a Dutch monopoly for commerce in spices. Finally, the author seeks an overall assessment of the Portuguese-Dutch conflict and its effects on the Estado da \u00cdndia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 74349464, "asset_id": 49420122,

between Portugal and the Dutch Republic (1609\u20131621) had expired and lasted from 1621 until 1636. Portugal, at that time, formed a personal union with Spain - the Iberian Union (1580\u20131640) - whose resources were drained by the costly struggle on the European scene, where the Thirty Years\u2019 War raged. The Dutch United East India Company (VOC) seized the opportunity to get rid of the Portuguese empire in Asia, called Estado da \u00cdndia, and end the Portuguese maritime dominance. At the same time, VOC exploited the Portuguese inability to carry out fundamental structural reforms, as well as Portuguese-Spanish suspicions and rivalries, which prevented effective cooperation between the two Iberian powers. Finally, VOC profited from the collapse of Portuguese trade on the Carreira da \u00cdndia, maritime route between Lisbon and India. At this time, VOC asserted its complete superiority in the maritime trade in Southeast Asia and the Far East and began to prepare for the final struggle in the western part of the Indian Ocean.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65237556, "asset_id": 44743944, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 76080132, "asset_id": 44743944, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3697817, "first_name": "Karel", "last_name": "Stan\u011bk", "domain_name": "nkp", "page_name": "KarelStan\u011bk", "display_name": "Karel Stan\u011bk", "profile_url": "https://nkp.academia.edu/KarelStan%C4%9Bk?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3697817/1316918/38346898/s65_karel.stan_k.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2861, "name": "Portuguese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portuguese_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4916, "name": "Portuguese Discoveries and Expansion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portuguese_Discoveries_and_Expansion?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 49917, "name": "Dutch History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 218722, "name": "Dutch overseas history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_overseas_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 433549, "name": "Portuguese expansion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portuguese_expansion?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 511225, "name": "History of the Portuguese Expansion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Portuguese_Expansion?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 552311, "name": "Portuguese Overseas Expansion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portuguese_Overseas_Expansion?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 44668237, "title": "Rituals and coutumes in the European slave trade on Madagascar in the 17th and 18th centuries", "created_at": "2020-12-09T07:04:06.323-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44668237/Rituals_and_coutumes_in_the_European_slave_trade_on_Madagascar_in_the_17th_and_18th_centuries?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_44668237", "summary": "In this text, we will retrace the commercial interactions linked to the slave trade between Europeans and Malagasy in the 17th and 18th centuries.

This ranged from presenting courtesy gifts up to the delivery of oral and written venerations, and represented an important cofirmation of power.

In this manner this article will question the extent to which institutional differences from Europe in the organisation of empire can account for the different fortunes of both empires in the seventeenth century. It argues that the fiscal systems of the Portuguese and Dutch, although largely adapted from the Asian fiscal matrices, varied in development and outcomes depending on the interaction with local rulers and on the intentions and goals of the colonisers. In drawing such a comparison, this article argues for caution against exaggerating the impact of institutional differences from Europe. Rather, it makes the claim that both the Portuguese empire and the VOC faced similar problems and opted for the same choices in Asia. More importantly, they both changed their stance on monopoly and taxation over time, showing a more fluid and less rigid attitude, than usually acknowledged in the literature. Instead of stressing institutional differences from Europe, continuity and the struggle with similar challenges stand out in the Asian experience of the Portuguese and Dutch empires.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9471790, "first_name": "Susana", "last_name": "M\u00fcnch Miranda", "domain_name": "fcsh-unl", "page_name": "SusanaM\u00fcnchMiranda", "display_name": "Susana M\u00fcnch Miranda", "profile_url": "https://fcsh-unl.academia.edu/SusanaM%C3%BCnchMiranda?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9471790/4269885/4965968/s65_susana.m_nch_miranda.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4770, "name": "Taxation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Taxation?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20433, "name": "History of the Portuguese Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Portuguese_Empire?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27282, "name": "Fiscal History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fiscal_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44146387, "title": "Introduction: Crossing Companies", "created_at": "2020-09-23T02:17:14.958-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44146387/Introduction_Crossing_Companies?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_44146387", "summary": "Imperial and world history have revealed how chartered companies led early modern European colonial and commercial expansion, and have demonstrated the critical role of go-betweens, permeable borders, and transnational networks in shaping these processes. Despite these insights, the scholarship largely continues to treat such companies as coherent, self-contained, and primarily national institutions. This special issue explores the ways in which these overseas companies were in fact constituted by people, ideas, capital, and goods that cut across both national and institutional boundaries. It examines both the ways more famous concerns, such as the Dutch and English East India Companies, as well as a range of lesser-studied European overseas companies were defined by such transnational networks. Applying the approaches of world history to the constitution of overseas European companies in turn reveals how early modern world history came to define \u201cEurope\u201d itself in the early modern period.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64500747, "asset_id": 44146387, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 697451, "first_name": "Felicia", "last_name": "Gottmann", "domain_name": "northumbria", "page_name": "FeliciaGottmann", "display_name": "Felicia Gottmann", "profile_url": "https://northumbria.academia.edu/FeliciaGottmann?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/697451/236799/2825227/s65_felicia.gottmann.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6541, "name": "World History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13334, "name": "Global History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 58559, "name": "East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44137820, "title": "Information Transfer between the English and Dutch East India Companies in the Early 17th Century", "created_at": "2020-09-22T01:07:19.352-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44137820/Information_Transfer_between_the_English_and_Dutch_East_India_Companies_in_the_Early_17th_Century?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_44137820", "summary": "The original version of this paper was presented at the conference \"Information and Power in History\" (Amsterdam, 16-17 March, 2017).

Caspar Schamberger (1623 - 1706) berufen, steht die Erforschung der japanischen Caspar-Chirurgie und damit auch des Aufkommens der 'Rothaar-Chirurgie' (K\u00f4m\u00f4ry\u00fb-geka) insgesamt in einer Stagnation, welche die vorliegende Arbeit aufzubrechen versucht. Es werden folgende Punkte behandelt: 1. Einsch\u00e4tzung des chirurgischen Wissens von Schamberger anhand der Pr\u00fcfungsbestimmungen der Leipziger Chirurgengilde von 1627 und des \"Examens der Chyrurgie\" von Cornelisz. Herls. 2. Diskussion der herk\u00f6mmlichen Genealogien der 'Caspar-Schule', der Frage der 'Sch\u00fcler' sowie eine kurze Vorstellung der nach Ansicht des Autors wichtigsten Mittler von Schambergers chirurgischen Instruktionen: Inomata Denpei, Kawaguchi Ry\u00f4an, Inoues Leibarzt 'T\u00f4saku', Nishi Genpo. 3. Isolierung der verl\u00e4sslichsten Handschriften der \"Caspar-Chirurgie\" durch einen umfassenden Vergleich zahlreicher Quellen. 4. Dataillierter \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die dort behandelte Chirurgie, \u00fcber Fragen des Verst\u00e4ndnisses und der '\u00dcbersetzung' der Begriffe, sowie \u00fcber die dahinterstehenden westlichen Schriften. 5. Diskussion der Handschrift \"Nanbanry\u00fb gekasho\", des Buches \"Oranda geka shinan\" (1697) sowie der Rolle von Sawano Ch\u00fban (Christov\u00e3o Ferreira) in bezug auf diese zwei Schriften. Bei beiden handelt es sich nicht, wie bislang behauptet, um eine getarnte Form der auf Ferreira und andere Iberer zur\u00fcckgehenden 'S\u00fcdbarbarenchirurgie'. Sie repr\u00e4sentieren vielmehr im wesentlichen die Instruktionen Schambergers und seiner Amtsnachfolger, stehen also in der Tradition der 'Rothaar-Chirurgie'.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59230116, "asset_id": 39110464, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33051498, "first_name": "Wolfgang", "last_name": "Michel-Zaitsu", "domain_name": "kyushu-u", "page_name": "WolfgangMichelZaitsuW\u30df\u30d2\u30a7\u30eb", "display_name": "Wolfgang Michel-Zaitsu", "profile_url": "https://kyushu-u.academia.edu/WolfgangMichelZaitsuW%E3%83%9F%E3%83%92%E3%82%A7%E3%83%AB?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33051498/10754105/25305854/s65_wolfgang.michel-zaitsu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6727, "name": "Early Modern (Japanese History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Japanese_History_?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23954, "name": "History of Medicine in Japan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Medicine_in_Japan?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 36327, "name": "Edo-period Japan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Edo-period_Japan?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 301233, "name": "Nagasaki", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nagasaki?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1325736, "name": "History of Western Studies In Japan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Western_Studies_In_Japan?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1347714, "name": "Dejima", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dejima?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 39112767, "title": "\u6c5f\u6238\u521d\u671f\u306e\u5149\u5b66\u88fd\u54c1\u8f38\u5165\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 [On Japanese Imports of Optical Instruments during the Early Edo Period]", "created_at": "2019-05-13T02:17:30.965-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39112767/%E6%B1%9F%E6%88%B8%E5%88%9D%E6%9C%9F%E3%81%AE%E5%85%89%E5%AD%A6%E8%A3%BD%E5%93%81%E8%BC%B8%E5%85%A5%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A4%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6_On_Japanese_Imports_of_Optical_Instruments_during_the_Early_Edo_Period_?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_39112767", "summary": "Based on unpublished sources of the Dutch East Indian Company (VOC) this study traces the imports of spectacles, magnifying glasses, telescopes and microscopes during the 17th and early 18th century. For each of these items it is shown when and how it was introduced to Japan and in which quantities it was delivered during the first decades. Technical specifications are given as well as the name of Japanese officials who received these optical instruments as presents or bought it as a high priced commodity. Furthermore the introduction of glass blowing is clarified for the first time. \r\nNot long after their invention in Europe the Dutch East India Company (VOC) brought remarkable quantities of telescopes to Nagasaki. Here they were used as presents for the shogun and government officials or sold as luxury goods to feudal lords and other high-ranking officials. \r\nSpectacles were first introduced by Chinese merchants. Until 1638 the Portguese participated in this market with sometimes amazing quantities. After 1640 the VOC, responding to frequent orders by Japanese government officials, brought high-quality spectacles in modest quantities which were sold together with lavish cases.\r\nWhile telescopes were introduced soon after their invention, it took more than a century for the first imports of microscopes to take place because they were considered to be less useful. For similar reasons the import of magnifying glasses was interrupted in 1668 when the Tokugawa regime declared a series of commodities to be unnecessary and therefore not welcome any more. \r\nJapanese lens making seems to have started already in the beginning of the 17th century. The first Western glas-blower probably was Nathaniel Castelaar, who even travelled to Edo in 1687. Around 1731 the existence of a Japanese telescope specialist in Nagasaki called Mori Ninzaemon can be traced.

After a ransack by plundering Maratha troops in 1754, the local Mughal-regent allowed the Dutch to construct a stronghold in the village. VOC-authorities commissioned military engineer Coenraad Pieter Keller to survey the plot of land allocated to them and deliver plans and a proposal how this fortification could be constructed. The eventual fort was poorly constructed and collapsed two times. Keller was scapegoated by his superiors. He did not let the allegations pass and defended himself at Batavia. His written apologia has been preserved and provides unique insights in the career of a hybrid mapmaker in colonial service. By careful archival research we can reconstruct the context in which the plans were produced, interpreted by their intended audience and circulated until it was acquired by Leiden University Libraries.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57146313, "asset_id": 37063015, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4937936, "first_name": "Jeroen", "last_name": "Bos", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "Bos", "display_name": "Jeroen Bos", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/Bos?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4937936/2132684/16944215/s65_jeroen.bos.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 133, "name": "Military History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3024, "name": "History of India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_India?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6878, "name": "History of Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Cartography?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30010, "name": "Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Empire?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54723, "name": "Fortifications", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fortifications?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 34749838, "title": "An Informal Franco-Dutch Alliance: Trade and Diplomacy Between the Mascarenes and the Cape, 1719-1769", "created_at": "2017-10-03T02:36:30.334-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34749838/An_Informal_Franco_Dutch_Alliance_Trade_and_Diplomacy_Between_the_Mascarenes_and_the_Cape_1719_1769?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_34749838", "summary": "In the eighteenth century, possessions of the different European mercantilist companies rarely interacted, commercially or otherwise.

The Portuguese empire, which in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries had been built to stretch from Brazil to Japan, reached its zenith around this time. The Dutch Republic and England, meanwhile, were just beginning to take over Portuguese sea routes and trading posts. The immense success and subsequent stagnation of Portuguese expansion, and the concomitant rise of the Dutch and English ventures overseas, have so far been described as driven by a combination of imperial politics, religious motivation and economic gain. My project will use a different, new approach to understanding this key moment: I will study the successes and failures of globalisation through a focus on art objects and their interaction with human beings and ideas. Central to the project will be an analysis of the seizure of two Portuguese cargo ships by the English and the Dutch and the aftermath of these events. Thus the project aims, through exploring the redirection of a large group of art objects that these hijackings entailed, and the debates about art objects that these events engendered on all sides of the divide, to examine the historical workings and meanings of globalisation around the turn of the seventeenth century.\n\nThis project is funded by a Leverhulme Research Fellowship.

One way of connecting cross-cultural exchanges to the technical, stylistic, and thematic aspects of objects is to focus on \u2018transmediality\u2019, or the crossovers between media to which the works\u2019 cultural biographies testify. Drawings were turned into prints and paintings of varying sizes; forms and themes were reshaped in new materials; the materials themselves were imitated or even forged; and boundaries between painting, architecture, and the applied arts were crossed or ignored. Such \u2018transmedial\u2019 objects may raise questions about cultural translation and visual literacy, about the role of artists and artworks as cultural mediators, about the institutions and networks they were connected to, and about worldviews that were affected by the circulation of knowledge. They may evidence to what extent Netherlandish art, rather than easing its way from center to periphery, had to prove its new relevance in contexts with stronger traditions. At the same time, imported objects could confirm or subvert the existing hierarchies of genre, materials, and authenticity in the Low Countries.\n\nThrough a consideration of \u2018transmediality\u2019, our panel invites papers that will not only complicate our approaches to global and cross-cultural materials, but also will enable us to consider vernacular styles through new lenses. We encourage submissions that explore content, materials, and makers excluded from conventional canons of fine art, and we seek papers employing methodologies that aim to expand our concept of globalism beyond geographic boundaries and binary comparison to consider cultures \u2013 print, mercantile, court \u2013 which may transcend these distinctions. We welcome submissions from art historians as well as those in related disciplines, including scholars whose focus may not be European art but whose work addresses objects that are in conversation with Netherlandish materials.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52339300, "asset_id": 32087386, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 75325, "first_name": "Thijs", "last_name": "Weststeijn", "domain_name": "uu", "page_name": "ThijsWeststeijn", "display_name": "Thijs Weststeijn", "profile_url": "https://uu.academia.edu/ThijsWeststeijn?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/75325/20782/19266/s65_thijs.weststeijn.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 136, "name": "Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1372, "name": "Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2366, "name": "Manuscripts and Early Printed Books", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Manuscripts_and_Early_Printed_Books?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2987, "name": "Renaissance Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Renaissance_Studies?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 5081, "name": "Painting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Painting?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 8121, "name": "Baroque Art and Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Baroque_Art_and_Literature?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 12974, "name": "Drawing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Drawing?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 13966, "name": "History of Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Art?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 14802, "name": "16th Century Netherlandish Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/16th_Century_Netherlandish_Art?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 14803, "name": "Northern Renaissance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Northern_Renaissance?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 17486, "name": "Printing History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Printing_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 18788, "name": "Applied Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Arts?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 22405, "name": "Baroque art and architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Baroque_art_and_architecture?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 26606, "name": "17th Century Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Dutch_Republic?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 159686, "name": "16th and 17th century Dutch and Flemish Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/16th_and_17th_century_Dutch_and_Flemish_Art?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 416979, "name": "Global Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Art_History?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 972366, "name": "Transmediality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transmediality?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 32007755, "title": "CfP: Copy/Copia: the theory and practice of copying, HNA 2018", "created_at": "2017-03-23T08:37:50.169-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32007755/CfP_Copy_Copia_the_theory_and_practice_of_copying_HNA_2018?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_32007755", "summary": "This session at the 2018 Historians of Netherlandish Art Conference seeks papers that engage with the making of copies, replicas, multiples, and/or reproductions \u2013 for pedagogical, devotional, commercial or connoisseurial purpose from ca. 1400 to 1700 Bringing together a discussion of copying practices in different media, alongside theories of the copy as encountered in early modern artist\u2019s contracts, religious, pedagogical and/or early ethnographic texts, legal documents and artist writings, the session's aim is to find parallels, resonances and points of disjuncture between contemporary theories of the copy in different material and cultural contexts.

The main question of this lecture is how protocol mirrored or shaped other facets of court politics. Protocol may be regarded as a special manifestation of attempts to forge, confirm, strengthen, or strain relations and therefore it sheds more or even a different kind of light on power struggles at the court, dynastic legitimation efforts, inter-state geopolitics, and the like. Outwardly, relationships may have appeared harmonious or at least \u2018courteous\u2019, but certain ceremonial\u2014or the very departure from it\u2014would in fact hint at the opposite. Further, humiliating ritual or breach of protocol, originally meant to merely reflect hierarchical or discordant contacts, could assume a life of its own and in turn worsen such relations.\n\nAs south Indian texts are often silent on how protocol actually proceeded, this study is largely based on the experiences recorded by Dutch East India Company servants who regularly visited the courts of Ikkeri, Tanjavur, Madurai, Ramnad, and (during its last phase) Vijayanagara itself. This research\u2014still very much work in progress\u2014addresses the following issues: What were the functions and manifestations of protocol and diplomatic insult at these courts? To which extent did these states resemble one another and Vijayanagara with respect to protocol? What was the influence of protocol and insult on political developments in these states? What is the value of south Indian and Dutch sources for the study of protocol at these courts?", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 197010, "first_name": "Lennart", "last_name": "Bes", "domain_name": "leidenuniv", "page_name": "LennartBes", "display_name": "Lennart Bes", "profile_url": "https://leidenuniv.academia.edu/LennartBes?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/197010/210675/3104090/s65_lennart.bes.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3024, "name": "History of India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_India?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20770, "name": "Tamil Nadu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tamil_Nadu?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 31733, "name": "Court Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Court_Culture?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 35653, "name": "South India  (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_India_History_?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 98518, "name": "Madurai", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Madurai?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 148858, "name": "Karnataka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Karnataka?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 241884, "name": "Dynastic Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dynastic_Politics?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 330062, "name": "Vijayanagara", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vijayanagara?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 518466, "name": "Ramnad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ramnad?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 685369, "name": "Keladi-Ikkeri Nayakas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Keladi-Ikkeri_Nayakas?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 816869, "name": "Vijayanagara-Nayaka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vijayanagara-Nayaka?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1349393, "name": "Ikkeri Nayakas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ikkeri_Nayakas?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1429424, "name": "Early Modern South India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_South_India?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 25737580, "title": "Juan de Silva in the Straits of Singapore, 1615-1616", "created_at": "2016-05-31T03:13:30.320-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/25737580/Juan_de_Silva_in_the_Straits_of_Singapore_1615_1616?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_25737580", "summary": "The Spanish Governor of the Philippines, Juan de Silva, commissioned the construction of what was arguably the largest European armada seen in Asian waters before 1620.

Widodo, better known as Jokowi, faced unique challenges in the early months of 2015. After centuries of colonial mismanagement and a brief Japanese invasion during World War II, Indonesia\u2019s period of political independence had been defined by the authoritarian regimes of Sukarno (1957-1967) and Suharto (1967-1998). Though a functioning democracy was instituted in the wake of the turmoil resulting from the Asian Crisis of 1997-1998, Jokowi represented the first elected president not to have ties with previous regimes. His bold agenda\u2014stretching from investments in maritime infrastructure to industrial policies and an effort to make Indonesia a global \u201cMecca\u201d for Islamic finance\u2014reflected this transition, and revolved around a conscious wish to break with Indonesia\u2019s torn past. Would Jokowi\u2019s policy proposals ultimately work?

"summary": "Our research is about the trade in material goods from Asia to Europe over this period, and its impact on Europe\u2019s consumer and industrial cultures. It entails a comparative study of Europe\u2019s East India Companies and the private trade from Asia over the period. The commodities trade was heavily dependent on private trade. The historiography to date has left a blind spot in this area, concentrating instead on corruption and malfeasance. Taking a global history approach we investigate the trade in specific consumer goods in many qualities and varieties that linked merchant communities and stimulated information flows. We set out how private trade functioned alongside and in connection with the various European East India companies; we investigate how this changed over time, how it drew on the Company infrastructure, and how it took the risks and developed new and niche markets for specific Asian commodities that the Companies could not sustain.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 292441, "first_name": "Timothy", "last_name": "Davies", "domain_name": "warwick", "page_name": "TimDavies", "display_name": "Timothy Davies", "profile_url": "https://warwick.academia.edu/TimDavies?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/292441/59304/61610/s65_tim.davies.jpg"}, {"id": 710744, "first_name": "Meike", "last_name": "von Brescius (n\u00e9e Fellinger)", "domain_name": "warwick", "page_name": "MeikeFellinger", "display_name": "Meike  von Brescius (n\u00e9e Fellinger)", "profile_url": "https://warwick.academia.edu/MeikeFellinger?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/710744/281139/332518/s65_meike.fellinger.jpg"}, {"id": 28247820, "first_name": "Chris", "last_name": "Nierstrasz", "domain_name": "warwick", "page_name": "ChrisNierstrasz", "display_name": "Chris Nierstrasz", "profile_url": "https://warwick.academia.edu/ChrisNierstrasz?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28247820/7984113/8943071/s65_chris.nierstrasz.jpg"}, {"id": 697451, "first_name": "Felicia", "last_name": "Gottmann", "domain_name": "northumbria", "page_name": "FeliciaGottmann", "display_name": "Felicia Gottmann", "profile_url": "https://northumbria.academia.edu/FeliciaGottmann?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/697451/236799/2825227/s65_felicia.gottmann.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5232, "name": "Eighteenth Century Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eighteenth_Century_Trade?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13334, "name": "Global History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41043, "name": "Merchants", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Merchants?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 58559, "name": "East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 627736, "name": "Swedish East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Swedish_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1221356, "name": "French East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 12860081, "title": "Export slaves and how the slave trade changed slavery on Madagascar in the 17th and 18th centuries.", "created_at": "2015-06-08T02:42:11.503-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12860081/Export_slaves_and_how_the_slave_trade_changed_slavery_on_Madagascar_in_the_17th_and_18th_centuries?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_12860081", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8326278, "first_name": "Rafa\u00ebl", "last_name": "Thi\u00e9baut", "domain_name": "iisg", "page_name": "Rafa\u00eblThi\u00e9baut", "display_name": "Rafa\u00ebl Thi\u00e9baut", "profile_url": "https://iisg.academia.edu/Rafa%C3%ABlThi%C3%A9baut?f_ri=65822", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6283, "name": "History of Slavery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Slavery?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13017, "name": "Slave Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Slave_Trade?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25275, "name": "Indian Ocean World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_World?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 74968, "name": "Madagascar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Madagascar?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 1221356, "name": "French East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 12068570, "title": "Agent of (a green) empire: the ethnobotanical notes of military engineer Carl Friedrich Reimer", "created_at": "2015-04-22T08:40:23.381-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12068570/Agent_of_a_green_empire_the_ethnobotanical_notes_of_military_engineer_Carl_Friedrich_Reimer?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_12068570", "summary": "An abstract of my paper presentation on the ethnobotanical notes, made by military engineer Carl Friedrich Reimer during his involvement with the inspection tour of the Military Commission (1789-1793).\r\n\r\nThis paper was presented at the Materia Medica on the Move conference that took place at Leiden, 15-17 April 2015.

The two principal mechanisms were suppression of opportunism and permission of agents to engage in private trade. There is near consensus in past research that the rigidity of the VOC in not permitting private trade left it unable to emulate more nimble rivals and contributed to its demise. Drawing on unique 18th-century archival data, a time-series analysis revises this assumption, showing that private-trade regulations, as a historical form of adaptation, occurred as a response to declining performance and exercised a beneficial financial impact. From the 1740s, control was more flexible than typically asserted, attempting to balance permission and prohibition. If principals recognized the economic upside of private trade, they were apprehensive about its social consequences.

Javanese \u201cwhite enclave\u201d and East Sumatra were the places of encounter of cultures and values, which change during the stay at the rubber plantages.\nThe writer Madelon Lulofs described the life in the Dutch colonies in her first two novels, based on personal experience: \"Rubber\" and \"Koeli\". While describing the life at the plantations, she makes an extensive use of color metaphors (primarily the opposition brown versus white). The aim of the quantitative analysis of the applied colors is to show the stereotyping of particular segments of the plantations population, and to trace the cultural transformations of the colonization participants. \nThe novel \"Rubber\" is dedicated to the view of the Dutch planters and \"Koeli\" on the life of rubber collectors. The connecting element between both views is the employment of colors, which distinguishes and also connects the colonizers and the colonized.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 41745285, "asset_id": 8132704, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3355917, "first_name": "Eva", "last_name": "Kubatova", "domain_name": "cuni", "page_name": "EvaKubatova", "display_name": "Eva Kubatova", "profile_url": "https://cuni.academia.edu/EvaKubatova?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3355917/1125614/14653550/s65_eva.kubatova.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 7868277, "title": "Trials of Slavery: Selected Documents Concerning Slaves from the Criminal Records of the Council of Justice at the Cape of Good Hope, 1705-1794", "created_at": "2014-08-04T05:21:18.492-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7868277/Trials_of_Slavery_Selected_Documents_Concerning_Slaves_from_the_Criminal_Records_of_the_Council_of_Justice_at_the_Cape_of_Good_Hope_1705_1794?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_7868277", "summary": "Trials of Slavery is a first in South African historiography, a collection of 87 verbatim records of trials involving slaves at the Cape during the 18th century.

The transcriptions are  printed in the original Dutch, along with an English translation and historical commentary.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8002573, "first_name": "Gerald", "last_name": "Groenewald", "domain_name": "johannesburg", "page_name": "GeraldGroenewald", "display_name": "Gerald Groenewald", "profile_url": "https://johannesburg.academia.edu/GeraldGroenewald?f_ri=65822", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8002573/3997984/64659588/s65_gerald.groenewald.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2272, "name": "Gender History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3410, "name": "Urban History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4121, "name": "Atlantic World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atlantic_World?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4153, "name": "Criminal Justice History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminal_Justice_History?f_ri=65822", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5432, "name": "Slavery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Slavery?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 6283, "name": "History of Slavery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Slavery?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 12958, "name": "South Africa (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Africa_History_?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 25275, "name": "Indian Ocean World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_World?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 27831, "name": "18th Century", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/18th_Century?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 28507, "name": "History of Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 62138, "name": "Cape Town", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cape_Town?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 128448, "name": "History of Crime and Punishment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Crime_and_Punishment?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 218722, "name": "Dutch overseas history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_overseas_history?f_ri=65822"}, {"id": 500948, "name": "Cape of Good Hope", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cape_of_Good_Hope?f_ri=65822"}]}, {"id": 7863159, "title": "Letters and Memorials of VOC Admiral Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge (1608-1616)", "created_at": "2014-08-03T21:26:07.106-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7863159/Letters_and_Memorials_of_VOC_Admiral_Cornelis_Matelieff_de_Jonge_1608_1616_?f_ri=65822", "dom_id": "work_7863159", "summary": "This paper examines the letters and memorials of Dutch Admiral Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge whose papers are were preserved in the private working papers of Hugo Grotius. In May 1605 Matelieff was the second fleet commander to set sail from Europe under the flag of the Dutch East India Company, better known by its initials VOC. Today he is best remembered today for his accomplishments in battle at sea against the armada of the Portuguese Viceroy Dom Martim Afonso de Castro off the coast of Malacca. As a businessman Matelieff ruthlessly proposed the monopolization of the trade in nutmeg, mace and cloves for the Dutch company in 1607/8.  As one of the early VOC directors to gain first-hand experience in Asia, he served on the board of the Gentlemen XVII, the VOC\u2019s central board of directors both before and briefly also after his return from Asia. Although Matelieff appears to have clashed with his fellow directors and accused them of short-sightedness and addicted to short-term profits, most of Matelieff\u2019s recommendations to improve the company\u2019s operations in Asia were in fact implemented over the course of about a decade. These recommendations arguably set the stage for the first Dutch Empire in Asia.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg",

Hudson\u2019s voyage and the lasting legacy of Dutch culture in New York, this book explores the life and times of a fascinating woman, her family, and her things. Margrieta was born in the Netherlands but lived at the extremes of the Dutch colonial world, in Malacca on the Malay Peninsula and in Flatbush, Brooklyn. When she came to New York in 1686 with her husband and set up a shop, she brought an astonishing array of Eastern goods, many of which were documented in an inventory made after her death in 1695. Extensive archival research has enabled a collaborative team to reconstruct her story and establish the depth of her connection to Dutch trading establishments in Asia. This is a groundbreaking contribution to the histories of New York City, the Dutch overseas empire, women, and material culture.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8177228,

powers) persistently used chartered companies and limited partnerships as their primary instruments for acquiring and exercising imperial control in Asia. At first glance, such reliance is puzzling as these companies were only intermittently profitable \u2013 primarily when they were able to exploit conditions created by famines, wars or socio-political unrest - and all of them proved woefully inadequate to the tasks set for them. Still, as the history of Asia from 1600 to c.1800 clearly shows, chartered companies were founded time and again, and for many European imperial experiments proved to be the institution of choice. My paper at the workshop will survey the two main survivors - the EIC and VOC \u2013 as well as their many failed competitors in order to gain a clearer picture why chartered companies became the institution of choice. It will also identify some of their most distinctive common features (such as standing capital, tradable shares, and quasi-sovereign powers), and assess the extent to which markets or government policy/ interference ultimately sealed their fate or success.\"\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg",

At the beginning of the twenty-first century, these models continue to shape regional responses to contemporary trends such as the rise of global Islamism.  \"", "downloadable_attachments": [],
