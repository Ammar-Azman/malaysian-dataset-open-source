The purpose of this paper is, indeed, not to advocate a solution but to convey the outcome of exploratory study and reflections. These are multifarious and cover a wide spectrum, from fundamental theory to higher education policy; they do not result in a well-integrated whole. In particular, I do not claim that what I state about foundations of higher education pedagogy such as progressivism and essentialism evaluated in the university syllabi, teaching and research can be proved to be valid by rigorous application of the theoretical framework. Indeed, I shall even stress that my theoretical research concerns the exploratory stage in the development of a conceptual apparatus to examine the prospects and challenges facing higher education. Many further stages have to be carefully studied before anyone can confidently rely upon the apparatus of using the classical foundation of education to measure the contribution of higher education in the successful integration of ASEAN and EAC. The present paper examines the rationale for harmonization of higher education in ASEAN and EAC integration, basing on the three topology recommended by departments for higher education which are teaching and assessment, research and community outreach. For that purpose, the paper focused on teaching and research and examined and basing on documentary analysis, observed a degree of harmonized teaching and interdependence in terms of syllabi indicators relying heavily on essentialism and progressivism theoretical paradigms of analysis. However, the trend of harmonization of research in all university is still vague and rotates around perhaps due to inaccessibility of relevant documents on several university web sites.
