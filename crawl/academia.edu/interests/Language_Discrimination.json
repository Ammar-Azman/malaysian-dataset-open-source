Even though Spanish is the most frequently spoken language after English (U.S. Census), it continues to be publicly repressed and stigmatized. Since the 2016 elections, there has been an increase in anti-immigrant climate and Anglo-centric rhetoric, as well as an explicit attack to Spanish and bilingualism in the U.S. Ironically, Spanish has functioned as a resource exclusively for those in positions of power, for political or economic advantages, yet it is considered unpatriotic to use Spanish as a \u201csymbol of a positive Latino ethnic identity\u201d (Garci\u0301a, 1993). \n\tGiven the current political climate, in this paper we study Latinx\u2019s use of Spanish in public spaces since Trump became president. We examine whether there has been a recent shift in the attitudes of young Latinx heritage language speakers toward using Spanish. Data from Arizona and California helps us shed light on how diverse Latinx communities are negotiating language use in the face of immigrant stress, especially as there are increased racial attacks, linguistic discrimination and linguistic profiling since the last elections (Flores, 2018; Holgu\u00edn-Mendoza, Oliver Rajar, Vergara-Wilson, 2017; Zarate, 2018).

Two reasons necessitate this attempt to localise issues: \n1) to refute denial of the presence of some of the issues highlighted in the interview in Asian contexts in a generic sense; and \n2) to raise awareness on language as a discriminating factor (something that Indian constitution is yet to realise). \n\nFurther, the questions asked are based on the opinions of the interviewers alone and are aimed at gaining insightful responses from the two experts. \nInterested readers can access the interview at:https://youtu.be/cye3lA-Gpik", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59846879, "asset_id": 39679345, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1389862, "first_name": "uma", "last_name": "chimirala", "domain_name": "efluniversity", "page_name": "umachimirala", "display_name": "uma chimirala", "profile_url": "https://efluniversity.academia.edu/umachimirala?f_ri=28108", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1389862/2754965/36302228/s65_uma.chimirala.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 28108, "name": "Language Discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Discrimination?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52580, "name": "Minority language rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_language_rights?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 707523, "name": "Bilingualismo, Language Policy and Planning, Crosscultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingualismo_Language_Policy_and_Planning_Crosscultural_Studies?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 18520017, "title": "Non-citizens \u2013 the Aliens at Home.

The incentive for carrying out the research was a desire to discover the reasons for an apparent prejudice held by the Latvian Government against its Russian-speaking population. The research mainly consists of examining the legal framework in the state of Latvia and interpreting relevant \u2018hard\u2019 data such as census and statistical results, with a comparison to how the other Baltic states, Estonia and Lithuania, dealt with their own citizenship issues. As citizenship, by its nature, is a contested concept, this paper provides an overview of the theories and definitions in academia on the subject. Ultimately, the paper reveals the existence of an essential difference in the exercise of political rights between citizens and non-citizens. It also presents the evidence of a predominant promotion of the Latvian language at the expense of the Russian language in minority educational institutions. The final piece comprising the Russian minorities\u2019 rights violations is the limitation placed on the use of their native language.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40108695, "asset_id": 18520017, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 19484668, "first_name": "Yulia", "last_name": "Oleynik / Julija Oleinika", "domain_name": "port", "page_name": "YuliyaOleynik", "display_name": "Yulia  Oleynik / Julija Oleinika", "profile_url": "https://port.academia.edu/YuliyaOleynik?f_ri=28108", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/19484668/7219056/11955821/s65_yulia.oleynik.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 16016, "name": "Citizenship and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship_and_Identity?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28108, "name": "Language Discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Discrimination?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 159181, "name": "Equality and Non Discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Equality_and_Non_Discrimination?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 297255, "name": "Russian-speaking minorities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian-speaking_minorities?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 307963, "name": "Rights of Non-Citizens", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rights_of_Non-Citizens?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 405127, "name": "Non-Citizens", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Non-Citizens?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 542527, "name": "Latvia. non-citizenships in Latvia, national minorities in Latvia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latvia._non-citizenships_in_Latvia_national_minorities_in_Latvia?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 925135, "name": "Russian language, post-Soviet language, and minority languages of the Russian Federation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian_language_post-Soviet_language_and_minority_languages_of_the_Russian_Federation?f_ri=28108"}]}, {"id": 79489389, "title": "The book on Non-Muslim Urdu Literators, Explodes the Myth that Urdu is Muslim", "created_at": "2022-05-19T22:45:24.058-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/79489389/The_book_on_Non_Muslim_Urdu_Literators_Explodes_the_Myth_that_Urdu_is_Muslim?f_ri=28108", "dom_id": "work_79489389", "summary": "Urdu has played an unforgettable role as a language of composite culture even before partition.

My interests in this paper are\r\ntheoretical (rather than empirical). The first of this paper\u2019s two substantive\r\nsections describes the nature of Thailand's (diverse) linguistic landscape and\r\nhow the language policies pursued by Bangkok resemble those of other states\r\nbetween South and Southeast Asia. In light of Bangkok\u2019s policies towards\r\nsouthern Malays resemble those that impacted Lao and Khmer-speaking\r\nBuddhists in the northeast provinces, I suggest that some dynamics in South\r\nThailand need to be de-exceptionalized. In the section the follows, I interact\r\nwith theoretical treatments of language and religion in ethno-nationalism,\r\nand linguistic injustice. My argument is that anyone seeking peaceful political\r\nresolutions in South Thailand \u2013 where a nation linguistic minority is connected to\r\nthe Malay cosmopolis \u2013 must address the politically sensitive issue of Thailand\u2019s\r\ndiscriminatory language policy that has led to widespread language loss.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56797406, "asset_id": 36845091,

The study was specifically focused on black South African professionals. Black professionals were found to exhibit signs of deep-rooted pain, anger and general emotional fatigue stemming from workplace-, socioeconomic and political triggers that evoked generational trauma and overall negative black lived experiences. The negative lived experiences could have led to racial identity dissonance and, in extreme cases, complete racial identity disassociation. Moreover, black professionals were found to display symptoms of 'survivor guilt,' stemming from the shared history of oppression amongst black people in South Africa. The 'survivor guilt' contributed toward a profound sense of shared responsibility and purpose to change the circumstances, experiences and overall perceptions about the capabilities of black professionals. Results showed that upbringing, determination, resilience, black support networks, and black leadership representation within organizational structures were important ingredients that positively contributed to the leadership aspirations and success of black professionals. The research discovered that, in some cases, black professionals leveraged white relationships to propel their careers forward, however, this practice reportedly resulted in the black professionals experiencing feelings of self-doubt in their own abilities. Self-doubt, also found to be a result of historical oppression, could have and have been shown to eventually lead to self-deselection, negatively impacting the aspirations and career advancement prospects of black professionals in organizational leadership. Furthermore, the research found that black leaders believed that their blackness, specifically, its unique texture of experiences and history in South Africa, provided them with superior empathetic leadership abilities toward other black employees. Black leaders frequently highlighted the distinctive values of ubuntu as the cornerstone of their leadership approach.

scholarly and political attention to language-related inequities in the 20th century precipitated a spate of orientations to language planning in multilingual societies. While various orientations indicate a shift from earlier deficit to affirmative views of multilingualism, vigorous debates persist about the logical and pragmatic merits of each orientation. The resulting advocacy for language and multilingualism has yet to result in widespread mother-language-based multilingual education policies and practices. This article reviews a strand of these debates (language as right or resource) and argues that these debates deploy stringent criteria of rationality and social justice that are discontinuous with empirical realities of multilingualism and plurilingualism. It uses ethnographic evidence from India and Nigeria to demonstrate that, instead of the fixities of such criteria, actual language decision making in complex multilingual societies demands an integrative approach to theory, policy, and practice that is dialogic, tentative, and promotive of all possible languages.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2005804, "first_name": "Desmond", "last_name": "Odugu", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DesmondOdugu", "display_name": "Desmond Odugu", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DesmondOdugu?f_ri=28108", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2005804/663126/823234/s65_desmond.odugu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 101, "name": "Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2743, "name": "Indigenous Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Languages?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5780, "name": "Ideology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ideology?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 8605, "name": "Language Policy and Politics of Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy_and_Politics_of_Identity?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 15674, "name": "Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistics?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 28108, "name": "Language Discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Discrimination?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 29511, "name": "Language and Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Education?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 69068, "name": "Language politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_politics?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 79187, "name": "Indian languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_languages?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 102322, "name": "Linguicism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguicism?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 153464, "name": "Language and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Politics?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 203569, "name": "Multilingual", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingual?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 229155, "name": "Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_Based_Multilingual_Education?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 231927, "name": "Indigenous Language Revitalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Language_Revitalization?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 492839, "name": "Education and language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_and_language?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 504968, "name": "Language of Instruction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_of_Instruction?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 548248, "name": "African sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_sociolinguistics?f_ri=28108"}]}, {"id": 73819144, "title": "Methods for the study of accent bias and access to elite professions", "created_at": "2022-03-15T06:47:22.052-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/73819144/Methods_for_the_study_of_accent_bias_and_access_to_elite_professions?f_ri=28108", "dom_id": "work_73819144", "summary": "Fair access to employment is vital for improving social mobility in Britain today.

Almost 300 phone calls were placed in four different city districts with a Turkish, USAmerican and German name and accent and a Turkish name and Standard German. The analysis shows intra-urban differences: in the more prestigious neighbourhood, Turkish-accented callers had significantly lower chances of getting a viewing. In all but one city district, the Standard German callers received the most viewing appointments, and the American English-accented callers had more chances than the Turkish callers speaking Standard German. A discourse analysis of an excerpt from an apartment application conversation shows how power relations are reproduced at a discourse level.

The second is the assignment of third person pronouns like she/her/hers and he/ him/his as well as non-binary pronouns like singular they/them/theirs or ze/ hir/hirs.

While various orientations indicate a shift from earlier deficit to affirmative views of multilingualism, vigorous debates persist about the logical and pragmatic merits of each orientation. The resulting advocacy for language and multilingualism has yet to result in widespread mother-language-based multilingual education policies and practices. This article reviews a strand of these debates (language as right or resource) and argues that these debates deploy stringent criteria of rationality and social justice that are discontinuous with empirical realities of multilingualism and plurilingualism. It uses ethnographic evidence from India and Nigeria to demonstrate that, instead of the fixities of such criteria, actual language decision making in complex multilingual societies demands an integrative approach to theory, policy, and practice that is dialogic, tentative, and promotive of all possible languages.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13240190, "first_name": "Desmond", "last_name": "Odugu", "domain_name": "lakeforest", "page_name": "DesmondOdugu", "display_name": "Desmond  Odugu", "profile_url": "https://lakeforest.academia.edu/DesmondOdugu?f_ri=28108", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13240190/10209115/18089258/s65_desmond.odugu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 101, "name": "Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2308, "name": "Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingualism?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2524, "name": "Sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2743, "name": "Indigenous Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Languages?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 8605, "name": "Language Policy and Politics of Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy_and_Politics_of_Identity?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 28108, "name": "Language Discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Discrimination?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 29511, "name": "Language and Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Education?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 55515, "name": "Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingual_Education?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 69068, "name": "Language politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_politics?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 79187, "name": "Indian languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_languages?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 102322, "name": "Linguicism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguicism?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 153464, "name": "Language and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Politics?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 229155, "name": "Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_Based_Multilingual_Education?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 231927, "name": "Indigenous Language Revitalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Language_Revitalization?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 371661, "name": "Native Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Native_Language?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 492839, "name": "Education and language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_and_language?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 504968, "name": "Language of Instruction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_of_Instruction?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 548248, "name": "African sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_sociolinguistics?f_ri=28108"}]}, {"id": 32169933, "title": "A NEW METHOD FOR TESTING THE ROLE OF LINGUISTIC DISCRIMINATION IN PEDAGOGICAL EVALUATION", "created_at": "2017-03-31T11:20:03.643-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32169933/A_NEW_METHOD_FOR_TESTING_THE_ROLE_OF_LINGUISTIC_DISCRIMINATION_IN_PEDAGOGICAL_EVALUATION?f_ri=28108", "dom_id": "work_32169933", "summary": "Many factors distort teachers' assessment and evaluation of students in the process of education.

Neuter gender predominantly denotes inanimate entities (K\u00f6pcke and Zubin 1996, 2009). The use of neutral gender in reference to women nevertheless has a long history in German, usually with pejorative connotations (K\u00f6pcke and Zubin 1996, 2009).

Even though Spanish is the most frequently spoken language after English (U.S. Census), it continues to be publicly repressed and stigmatized. Since the 2016 elections, there has been an increase in anti-immigrant climate and Anglo-centric rhetoric, as well as an explicit attack to Spanish and bilingualism in the U.S. Ironically, Spanish has functioned as a resource exclusively for those in positions of power, for political or economic advantages, yet it is considered unpatriotic to use Spanish as a \u201csymbol of a positive Latino ethnic identity\u201d (Garci\u0301a, 1993). Given the current political climate, in this paper we study Latinx\u2019s use of Spanish in public spaces since Trump became president. We examine whether there has been a recent shift in the attitudes of young Latinx heritage language speakers toward using Spanish. Data from Arizona and California helps us shed light on how diverse Latinx communities are negotiating language use in the face of immigrant stress, especially as there are increased racial attacks, linguistic discrimination and linguistic profiling since the last elections (Flores, 2018; Holgu\u00edn-Mendoza, Oliver Rajar, Vergara-Wilson, 2017; Zarate, 2018).", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 53439248, "first_name": "Angelica", "last_name": "Amezcua", "domain_name": "asu", "page_name": "AAmezcua", "display_name": "Angelica Amezcua", "profile_url": "https://asu.academia.edu/AAmezcua?f_ri=28108", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/53439248/14194091/35137276/s65_angelica.amezcua.jpeg"}, {"id": 2489558, "first_name": "Ana", "last_name": "Sanchez-Munoz", "domain_name": "csun", "page_name": "AnaSanchezMunoz", "display_name": "Ana Sanchez-Munoz", "profile_url": "https://csun.academia.edu/AnaSanchezMunoz?f_ri=28108", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2489558/1115189/8409925/s65_ana.sanchez-munoz.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2524, "name": "Sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28108, "name": "Language Discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Discrimination?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33010, "name": "Language Attitudes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Attitudes?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 66904, "name": "Indiana University", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indiana_University?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 766419, "name": "US Latino and Spanish in the US Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/US_Latino_and_Spanish_in_the_US_Studies?f_ri=28108"}]}, {"id": 75193057, "title": "In Conversation with Tove Skutnabb-Kangas and Robert Phillipson", "created_at": "2022-04-01T19:27:05.116-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/75193057/In_Conversation_with_Tove_Skutnabb_Kangas_and_Robert_Phillipson?f_ri=28108", "dom_id": "work_75193057", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 83061186, "asset_id": 75193057, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 145939066, "first_name": "uma", "last_name": "CHIMIRALA", "domain_name": "nalsar", "page_name": "umaCHIMIRALA", "display_name": "uma CHIMIRALA", "profile_url": "https://nalsar.academia.edu/umaCHIMIRALA?f_ri=28108", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 24342, "name": "Conversation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conversation?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28108, "name": "Language Discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Discrimination?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42321, "name": "Linguistic Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Human_Rights?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46948, "name": "Bilingualism and Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingualism_and_Multilingualism?f_ri=28108", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52580, "name": "Minority language rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_language_rights?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 69856, "name": "Social Science Research Network", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Science_Research_Network?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 70855, "name": "Interview", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interview?f_ri=28108"}, {"id": 2836309, "name": "Robert Phillipson", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Robert_Phillipson?f_ri=28108"}]}, {"id": 51644921, "title": "When you\u2019re in with the in-crowd", "created_at": "2021-09-09T14:27:48.678-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/51644921/When_you_re_in_with_the_in_crowd?f_ri=28108", "dom_id": "work_51644921", "summary": "This paper examines the discursive construction of the International Baccalaureate (IB) in a 1.5 million word corpus of Canadian newspapers. Combining corpus analysis with the Discourse Historical branch of Critical Discourse Analysis, the study aims to identify discursive strategies employed in the construction of an IB in-group and a non-IB out-group, and suggests they are similar to those evident in discourses of discrimination that marginalise or exclude the outgroup (Baker, Gabrielatos and McEnery 2013a; KhosraviNik 2010; Reisigl and Wodak 2001). While discourses of discrimination tend to be directed at minority groups, in this case, the minority group is the in-group, exhibiting uniformly positive qualities. As a result, a \u2018dichotomous world of insiders and outsiders\u2019 (Reisigl and Wodak 2001:105) is created, privileging one and disadvantaging the other.

The papers in this volume illustrate how a range of topics, including EU law, ombudsman, judges, lawyers, Shariah Councils and the quality assurance industry can be researched from a socio-legal perspective. The objective of the collection is to show how different methods can be used in researching law and legal phenomena, how methodological issues and debates in sociology are relevant to the study of law, and the importance of the debate between &quot;structural&quot; and &quot;action&quot; traditions in researching law. It also approaches the methodological problem of how the sociology of law can address the content of legal practice from a variety of perspectives and discusses the relationship between pure and applied research. The editors provide a critical introduction to each of the six sections, and a general introduction on law, sociology and method. The collection will provide an invaluable resource for socio-legal researchers, law school researchers and postgraduates. Keywords: Law, sociology, method, methodology, positivism, structuralism, action theory, ethnomethodology, systems theory, autopoiesis, interpretive methods, discourse analysis, legal cultures, globalisation, socio-legal research, social theory, legal theory. &quot;", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11482875, "first_name": "Reza", "last_name": "Banakar",

"Socio-legal researchers increasingly recognise the need to employ a wide variety of methods in studying law and legal phenomena, and the need to be informed by an understanding of debates about theory and method in mainstream social science. The papers in this volume illustrate how a range of topics, including EU law, ombudsman, judges, lawyers, Shariah Councils and the quality assurance industry can be researched from a socio-legal perspective. The objective of the collection is to show how different methods can be used in researching law and legal phenomena, how methodological issues and debates in sociology are relevant to the study of law, and the importance of the debate between \"structural\" and \"action\" traditions in researching law. It also approaches the methodological problem of how the sociology of law can address the content of legal practice from a variety of perspectives and discusses the relationship between pure and applied research. The editors provide a critical introduction to each of the six sections, and a general introduction on law, sociology and method. The collection will provide an invaluable resource for socio-legal researchers, law school researchers and postgraduates. \r\n\r\nKeywords: Law, sociology, method, methodology, positivism, structuralism, action theory, ethnomethodology, systems theory, autopoiesis, interpretive methods, discourse analysis, legal cultures, globalisation, socio-legal research, social theory, legal theory.
