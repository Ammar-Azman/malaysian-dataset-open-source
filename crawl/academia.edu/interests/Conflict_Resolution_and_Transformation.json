At the heart of such inadequacies, however, is the persistent conceptual ambiguity regarding the nature of the movement and the threat it poses to the Indian state. Authorities have been periodically compelled to revisit their strategies after each successful extremist attack. And yet, a comprehensive national strategy providing a long term solution to LWE remains a far fetched goal. The 25 May 2013 extremist attack in the state of Chhattisgarh provided yet another opportunity to rethink and reset the official strategy. Whether the new strategy would end the ambiguity and explore alternate mechanisms for conflict resolution, however, remains to be seen.

The rationale of this research paper is to analyze if Indian oscillatory political behaviour fits neatly into the theoretical framework of Johan Galtung's Conflict Triangle. The research paper seeks to (i) analyze radicalization of Indian society on the basis of Hindutva, (ii) validates that Indian politics transitioned from secularity to extremism under Modi's Hindutva Nationalism and (iii) Indian political radicalization has worsened the already precarious situation of Kashmir Conflict.

Arguably, the four countries scrutinised in the study have many similarities rooted in shared historical grievances, but also linked to underperforming economies, bad governance and administrative dysfunctionality, national and ethnic tensions and unresolved identity issues. The research project focused on the meso-level and sought to identify factors of community vulnerability and resilience to violent extremism, and to formulate and test recommendations drawn from peacebuilding for effective prevention of violent extremism (PVE). In order to identify and understand what makes communities resilient to violent extremism, researchers analysed communities\u2019 characteristics in a given socio-economic, ideological and political context. Affected and unaffected communities were the main \u2018target\u2019 of the research, which aimed to explore and identify what makes a certain community stand out in its ability (by chance or choice) to prevent or resist the threats of violent extremism, or be influenced by ideological and/or physical forms of violent extremism. It quickly became clear that communities are neither fully affected nor completely unaffected \u2013 an unaffected community might still share the same \u2018breeding ground\u2019 traits as affected municipalities and an affected community could still display some features of a resilient community.

The church in particular is not devoid of conflict of all kinds. Church leaders and other stakeholders in the church have not only to resolve these conflicts, they have to also transform the conflicts and ensure that people live in peaceful coexistence as much as it is possible. The advent of the Internet in general and social media in particular has affected the way people are doing things tremendously. This includes conflict transformation in the church as well. This paper gives a brief introduction to conflict transformation in general and conflict transformation specifically in the church. It gives a brief biblical basis on conflict transformation. Furthermore, it delves extensively on the biblical basis for conflict transformation in churches through social media. It concludes that stakeholders in the church should blend theology together with technology, especially the social media, in transforming conflicts that are arising within the church.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66029965, "asset_id": 45552618, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31246838, "first_name": "Adebayo", "last_name": "Afolaranmi", "domain_name": "leadcity", "page_name": "AdebayoAfolaranmi", "display_name": "Adebayo Afolaranmi", "profile_url": "https://leadcity.academia.edu/AdebayoAfolaranmi?f_ri=960599", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31246838/9192289/93049014/s65_adebayo.afolaranmi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1302, "name": "Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theology?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3849, "name": "Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9246, "name": "Social Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17177, "name": "Conflict Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 232775, "name": "Conflict Transformation and Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation_and_Peace_Studies?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 265632, "name": "Theology and Religious Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theology_and_Religious_Studies?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 873508, "name": "PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE IN A RELIGIOUS PLURALISTIC SOCIETY.", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/PEACEFUL_CO-EXISTENCE_IN_A_RELIGIOUS_PLURALISTIC_SOCIETY?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 873513, "name": "PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE IN A MULTI-RELIGIOUS SCIETY", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/PEACEFUL_CO-EXISTENCE_IN_A_MULTI-RELIGIOUS_SCIETY?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 960599, "name": "Conflict Resolution and Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution_and_Transformation?f_ri=960599"}]}, {"id": 2040709, "title": "The Constitution of Religious Political Violence", "created_at": "2012-10-18T19:17:24.993-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2040709/The_Constitution_of_Religious_Political_Violence?f_ri=960599", "dom_id": "work_2040709", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 29559241, "asset_id": 2040709, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2645144, "first_name": "Roger", "last_name": "Friedland", "domain_name": "ucsb", "page_name": "RogerFriedland", "display_name": "Roger Friedland", "profile_url": "https://ucsb.academia.edu/RogerFriedland?f_ri=960599", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2645144/842669/17893192/s65_roger.friedland.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5686, "name": "Political Violence and Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Violence_and_Terrorism?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41274, "name": "Iran", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iran?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 960598, "name": "Religious and Political Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_and_Political_Violence?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 960599, "name": "Conflict Resolution and Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution_and_Transformation?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 960600, "name": "Regime Types", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Regime_Types?f_ri=960599"}]}, {"id": 6925201, "title": "Barriers toward peace in southern Thailand", "created_at": "2014-04-30T19:55:03.692-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6925201/Barriers_toward_peace_in_southern_Thailand?f_ri=960599", "dom_id": "work_6925201", "summary": "The history of talks with former-separatists since 2004 and recent government attempts at building trust with the local population have yet to achieve any noticeable results in troubled southern Thailand.

Certain local and external factors also shape the conflict, such as the role of Malaysia as a safe-haven for insurgents and the role of the black-economy in the region.

current global Covid-19 pandemic has not spared Zimbabwe from the impact of domestic violence against women and girls. To curtail the spread of the covid-19 virus, the government of Zimbabwe enforced restrictions on movements causing an epidemic of gender-based violence. The trend became 'an epidemic within a pandemic' against women and children. Emerging evidence reflects that lockdown affected economic growth and increased poverty, caused inability for women to escape from abusive partners; ineffective health, and law enforcement service delivery. As a result, unequal gender relations, and patriarchal norms against women became prominent. Identified forms of domestic violence are physical, sexual, economic and psychological abuse leading to deaths, injuries, commercial sex work, stress, early marriages, and unwanted pregnancies; child labour and sexually transmitted infections. The study identified government, church, policy-makers and non-governmental organisations, donors and women's organizations as institutions with possible solutions. The study argues that the domestic violence epidemic has exposed, and been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, hence multifaceted intervention strategies are needed to safeguard vulnerable groups. Strategies comprise of psychosocial support, use of social media to disclose domestic violence, effective legal and justice system operations, inclusivity in policy-making, and implementation process, economic empowerment for income generating projects, and provision of an effective health delivery system. Complexities which hinder effective intervention against domestic violence were also identified. Hence, the study recommends that stakeholders to ensure that necessary services remain accessible. Also, adequate funding to enable high quality of domestic violence interventions, prioritise prevention, response and risk mitigation activities as part of stakeholders' objectives in humanitarian programs and inclusivity of women, and girls in policy-making, and implementation. The study adopts a qualitative approach. Under current lockdown conditions, desk review, official and media reports analysis on the topic; WhatsApp interviews with key selected informants were used.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73754143, "asset_id": 60208364, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25994453, "first_name": "Joseph", "last_name": "Muwanzi", "domain_name": "ukzn", "page_name": "JosephMuwanzi", "display_name": "Joseph Muwanzi", "profile_url": "https://ukzn.academia.edu/JosephMuwanzi?f_ri=960599", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/25994453/20250608/19965994/s65_joseph.muwanzi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3995, "name": "Disaster risk management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disaster_risk_management?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29252, "name": "Psychological Therapies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychological_Therapies?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 93828, "name": "Peace and Conflict Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Transformation?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 123202, "name": "Post-Conflict Reconciliation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Conflict_Reconciliation?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 139535, "name": "Substance Abuse Prevention", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Substance_Abuse_Prevention?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 615427, "name": "Domestic and Family Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Domestic_and_Family_Violence?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 960599, "name": "Conflict Resolution and Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution_and_Transformation?f_ri=960599"}]}, {"id": 10514710, "title": "Leading Growth through Sustainable Social Contexts\nThree Fundamental Considerations for Conflict Transformation and Inclusion of Diversity", "created_at": "2015-02-04T10:19:03.050-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10514710/Leading_Growth_through_Sustainable_Social_Contexts_Three_Fundamental_Considerations_for_Conflict_Transformation_and_Inclusion_of_Diversity?f_ri=960599", "dom_id": "work_10514710", "summary": "The rapidly changing world we live in is fraught with increasing divisions and destructive conflict. Consequently, a resilient social fabric becomes crucial for people to feel included and empowered by their differences. The quality of relationships and the social environments, within which they are constantly being formed, are critical for successfully addressing divisive challenges and the destructive conflicts they might spawn. This chapter proposes a framework of three considerations for transforming conflict: 1. The mode of relationship- how the Self relates to the Other, 2. The perception of conflict, and 3. The social environment and the role of leadership in constructing dialogic environments. Revisiting assumptions pertaining to these considerations can support a shift from the unit of the individual (typically characterizes Western cultural and scientific traditions) to a relational unit. This shift is proposed as a premise for long-term transformation from adversarial interactions into dialogic relations. The latter is suggested as a constructive mode of relationship: a way of being with one another in which self and the other actively and equally co-create reality and relating to one another in their own terms. The chapter concludes with an example from an educational environment within which a relational transformation took place by integrating both micro efforts- consciousness raising to relational forms and dynamics, and macro work of restructuring the social context.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65480360, "asset_id": 10514710, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2682119, "first_name": "Tzofnat", "last_name": "Peleg-Baker", "domain_name": "camden-sbc-rutgers", "page_name": "TzofnatPelegBaker", "display_name": "Tzofnat Peleg-Baker", "profile_url": "https://camden-sbc-rutgers.academia.edu/TzofnatPelegBaker?f_ri=960599", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2682119/25491227/41686289/s65_tzofnat.peleg-baker.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 240, "name": "Organizational Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organizational_Psychology?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 956, "name": "Organizational Communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organizational_Communication?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1324, "name": "Organizational Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organizational_Change?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2919, "name": "Organizational Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organizational_Culture?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 2969, "name": "Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Leadership?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 10431, "name": "Organizational Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organizational_Leadership?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 13614, "name": "Conflict Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 17177, "name": "Conflict Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 17802, "name": "Diversity & Inclusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diversity_and_Inclusion?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 19707, "name": "Social Inclusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Inclusion?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 42465, "name": "Organizational Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organizational_Development?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 143965, "name": "Social Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Conflict?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 199285, "name": "Strategic Change and Organizational Transformations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Strategic_Change_and_Organizational_Transformations?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 232775, "name": "Conflict Transformation and Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation_and_Peace_Studies?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 627973, "name": "Conflict Engagement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Engagement?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 960599, "name": "Conflict Resolution and Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution_and_Transformation?f_ri=960599"}]}, {"id": 74926807, "title": "INDIAN POLITICO-RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM AND KASHMIR: A STUDY OF MODI\u2019s INDIA", "created_at": "2022-03-29T19:29:04.850-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/74926807/INDIAN_POLITICO_RELIGIOUS_EXTREMISM_AND_KASHMIR_A_STUDY_OF_MODI_s_INDIA?f_ri=960599", "dom_id": "work_74926807", "summary": "Individual or group identities based upon religion are able to cause political activation affecting cogency of governments and their policies.

Arguably, the four countries scrutinised in the study have many similarities rooted in shared historical grievances, but also linked to underperforming economies, bad governance and administrative dysfunctionality, national and ethnic tensions and unresolved identity issues. The research project focused on the meso-level and sought to identify factors of community vulnerability and resilience to violent extremism, and to formulate and test recommendations drawn from peacebuilding for effective prevention of violent extremism (PVE). In order to identify and understand what makes communities resilient to violent extremism, researchers analysed communities\u2019 characteristics in a given socio-economic, ideological and political context.

For the development of this research, we considered ethnography for peace (ethnope- ace) as a methodology to analyze the weave of interactions within the academic community, as well as some fundamental theories of philosophy, pedagogy, peace education and conflicts. The concept of liberating peace is proposed as a Latin American contribution to peace studies because it offers a decolonizing perspective that en- ables local narratives.

The main aim of this chapter is to explore the impact of four selected community design methods on competences for personal sustainability as practiced in intentional communities. \nThe cases of intentional communities are particularly relevant in their pioneering path towards innovative sustainable lifestyles following an integrative approach based on all four dimensions of sustainability. From a socio-cultural perspective their innovative methods nurture intra-personal growth processes based on a matured conflict culture and peaceful coexistence culture in regards to both human and natural systems.\nFirst, the distinctive levels of conflict resolution and self-empowerment are discussed particularly as central experiences for personal sustainability development. Next, a typology of community design methods are introduced as developed or practiced in different ecovillages: Forum, We- Process, Dreamwork and Emotional Baggage Dischargement. The analysis will concentrate especially on the Emotional Baggage Dischargement case. The method allows to access and resolve deeply grounded personal conflicts fostering a valuable community conflict culture. The method analysis evidences the needs, motivations and interests of ecovillagers regarding inner conflict resolution and self-empowerment for sustainable lifestyles. The focus relies on identifying significant personal capacities to be acquired through these methods as reflecting on interiorized rules of conduct or behaving following one\u2019s own authenticity. \nThe research design follows the method of transdisciplinary research in sustainability science based on the knowledge gained by the analysis of specific case studies, qualitative interviews and the long personal experience of the authors practicing the community design methods. \nAs a result, the chapter gives a comparative view of relevant community-design methods for inner conflict resolution and self-empowerment practiced by intentional communities as a path to personal sustainability and recommendations for its personal implementation and further research.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68945724, "asset_id": 51095165, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 48056841, "first_name": "Stella", "last_name": "Veciana", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "StellaVeciana", "display_name": "Stella Veciana", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/StellaVeciana?f_ri=960599", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/48056841/12657523/14080210/s65_stella.veciana.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13614, "name": "Conflict Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 83138, "name": "Community Based Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Based_Research?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 126520, "name": "Self Advocacy and Empowerment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_Advocacy_and_Empowerment?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 187501, "name": "Ecovillages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecovillages?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 249881, "name": "Inter-personal and Intra-personal communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Inter-personal_and_Intra-personal_communication?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 651747, "name": "Self Empowerment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_Empowerment?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 960599, "name": "Conflict Resolution and Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution_and_Transformation?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 1122210, "name": "Ecovillages and Intentional Communities: In search of sustainable alternative solutions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecovillages_and_Intentional_Communities_In_search_of_sustainable_alternative_solutions?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 1163066, "name": "Personal Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Personal_Sustainability?f_ri=960599"}]}, {"id": 81628725, "title": "Market women\u2019s informal peacebuilding efforts in Ekumfi-Narkwa, Ghana", "created_at": "2022-06-16T07:50:04.412-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/81628725/Market_women_s_informal_peacebuilding_efforts_in_Ekumfi_Narkwa_Ghana?f_ri=960599", "dom_id": "work_81628725", "summary": "This study examines market women&amp;#39;s participation in peacebuilding in the Ekumfi-Narkwa community in the Central Region of Ghana.

The look into this broader picture, we believe, surely brings complexities into the analysis, yet also provides new insights into possible strategies for moving forward that are not visible when viewed from a narrow binary perspective.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45593869, "asset_id": 19902437, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 201962, "first_name": "Pinar", "last_name": "Sayan", "domain_name": "beykoz", "page_name": "PinarSayan", "display_name": "Pinar Sayan", "profile_url": "https://beykoz.academia.edu/PinarSayan?f_ri=960599", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/201962/771794/3917323/s65_pinar.sayan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3849, "name": "Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4424, "name": "Post-conflict Reconstruction and Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-conflict_Reconstruction_and_Development?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10966, "name": "Turkey", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Turkey?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13614, "name": "Conflict Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 14370, "name": "Conflict Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Management?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 16211, "name": "Ethnic Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Conflict?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 17177, "name": "Conflict Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 20520, "name": "Peace & Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies-3?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 24048, "name": "Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_Studies?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 28981, "name": "Ethnic Conflict and Civil War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Conflict_and_Civil_War?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 33669, "name": "Azerbaijan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Azerbaijan?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 33670, "name": "Armenia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Armenia?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 36160, "name": "Ethnicity & Ethnic Conflicts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity_and_Ethnic_Conflicts?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 45578, "name": "Peacebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peacebuilding?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 52234, "name": "Peace and Conflict Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Resolution?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 93828, "name": "Peace and Conflict Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Transformation?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 232775, "name": "Conflict Transformation and Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation_and_Peace_Studies?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 273182, "name": "Inter-civilization contact and conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Inter-civilization_contact_and_conflict?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 447363, "name": "Post conflict, Reconstruction, Peace building and Transitional Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post_conflict_Reconstruction_Peace_building_and_Transitional_Justice?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 454006, "name": "Turkey-Armenia Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Turkey-Armenia_Relations?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 512540, "name": "Post Conflict Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post_Conflict_Development?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 609104, "name": "Peace and Conflicts Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflicts_Studies?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 636840, "name": "Conflict and Conflict Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_and_Conflict_Resolution?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 931986, "name": "Post Conflict Issues", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post_Conflict_Issues?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 960599, "name": "Conflict Resolution and Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution_and_Transformation?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 986660, "name": "Conflict Management and Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Management_and_Transformation?f_ri=960599"}]}, {"id": 3688667, "title": "The Rhetoric of Revolution", "created_at": "2013-06-11T05:03:37.733-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3688667/The_Rhetoric_of_Revolution?f_ri=960599", "dom_id": "work_3688667", "summary": "Tehrik-i Taliban Pakistan;

To curtail the spread of the covid-19 virus, the government of Zimbabwe enforced restrictions on movements causing an epidemic of gender-based violence. The trend became &amp;#39;an epidemic within a pandemic&amp;#39; against women and children. Emerging evidence reflects that lockdown affected economic growth and increased poverty, caused inability for women to escape from abusive partners; ineffective health, and law enforcement service delivery. As a result, unequal gender relations, and patriarchal norms against women became prominent. Identified forms of domestic violence are physical, sexual, economic and psychological abuse leading to deaths, injuries, commercial sex work, stress, early marriages, and unwanted pregnancies; child labour and sexually transmitted infections. The study identified government, church, policy-makers and non-governmental organisations, donors and women&amp;#39;s organizations as institutions with possible solutions. The study argues that the domestic violence epidemic has exposed, and been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, hence multifaceted intervention strategies are needed to safeguard vulnerable groups. Strategies comprise of psychosocial support, use of social media to disclose domestic violence, effective legal and justice system operations, inclusivity in policy-making, and implementation process, economic empowerment for income generating projects, and provision of an effective health delivery system. Complexities which hinder effective intervention against domestic violence were also identified. Hence, the study recommends that stakeholders to ensure that necessary services remain accessible. Also, adequate funding to enable high quality of domestic violence interventions, prioritise prevention, response and risk mitigation activities as part of stakeholders&amp;#39; objectives in humanitarian programs and inclusivity of women, and girls in policy-making, and implementation. The study adopts a qualitative approach. Under current lockdown conditions, desk review, official and media reports analysis on the topic; WhatsApp interviews with key selected informants were used.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25994453, "first_name": "Joseph", "last_name": "Muwanzi", "domain_name": "ukzn", "page_name": "JosephMuwanzi", "display_name": "Joseph Muwanzi", "profile_url": "https://ukzn.academia.edu/JosephMuwanzi?f_ri=960599", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/25994453/20250608/19965994/s65_joseph.muwanzi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1663, "name": "Domestic Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Domestic_Violence?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3995, "name": "Disaster risk management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disaster_risk_management?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29252, "name": "Psychological Therapies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychological_Therapies?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 93828, "name": "Peace and Conflict Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Transformation?f_ri=960599", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 123202, "name": "Post-Conflict Reconciliation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Conflict_Reconciliation?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 139535, "name": "Substance Abuse Prevention", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Substance_Abuse_Prevention?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 615427, "name": "Domestic and Family Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Domestic_and_Family_Violence?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 960599, "name": "Conflict Resolution and Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution_and_Transformation?f_ri=960599"}, {"id": 1028827, "name": "Pandemic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pandemic?f_ri=960599"}]}]
