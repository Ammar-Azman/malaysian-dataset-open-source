How to make sense of the shadow-play as a form of world-making? In Tall Tree, Nest of the Wind, Bernard Arps explores this question by considering an all-night performance of Dewa Ruci, a key play in the repertoire. Thrilling and profound, Dewa Ruci describes the mighty Bratasena\u2019s quest for the ultimate mystical insight.\n     The book presents  Dewa Ruci as rendered by the distinguished master puppeteer Ki Anom Soeroto in Amsterdam in 1987. The book\u2019s unusual design presents the performance texts together with descriptions of the sounds and images that would remain obscure in conventional formats of presentation. Copious annotations probe beneath the surface and provide an understanding of the performance's cultural complexity. These annotations explain the meanings of puppet action, music, and shifts in language; how the puppeteer wove together into the drama the circumstances of the performance in Amsterdam, Islamic and other religious ideas, and references to contemporary Indonesian political ideology. Also revealed is the performance\u2019s historical multilayering and the picture it paints of the Javanese past.\n     Tall Tree, Nest of the Wind not only presents an unrivalled insight into the artistic depth of wayang kulit, it exemplifies a new field of study, the philology of performance.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45693702, "asset_id": 22488991, "asset_type": "Work",

recognised as a global musical culture, few studies have examined its practices of choreography. This essay privileges the ways Hip-hop dancers in Manila theorise their practices through four main aspects-genre, mode, dimension and conflict-in order to draw attention to the principles of meaning-making in contemporary Hip-hop performance. This article suggests that a dance-based system of knowledge is helpful to our understanding of music and performance in Asia and the Pacific because it fleshes out internal discourses of Hip-hop and promotes a mindfulness regarding assumptions around the performing body. Taken as a whole, these aspects help articulate conventional concerns around studying Hip-hop dance. This explanatory framework, hopefully, clears up more room to move when theorising through and about Hip-hop and promotes the critical study of dance practices in the Philippines with larger implications for contemporary\npopular music and performance in Asia and beyond.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61601492, "asset_id": 41415607, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1767791, "first_name": "J.

This essay examines the impact these wars had on concert dance, at the time still a newly emerging art form in China, by examining the case of Liang Lun \u6881\u502b (b. 1921), a dancer from Guangdong who began his dance career during the 1940s. Although Liang is widely considered to be one of the founding figures of modern Chinese dance, he has received almost no attention in the English language scholarship. This essay thus serves as a preliminary examination of Liang\u2019s early choreographic repertoire, as well as a reflection on the ways in which Liang\u2019s experiences reflect broader trends in Chinese dance during the wartime period.\nTable of Contents\n\u2160.

This paper aimed at revealing the profound and unbroken connection between Zenism and Noh theater by investigating some of the theoretical and practical principles of Noh theater, including the aesthetics, kinesthetic, mask features, the directing of actors, etc. Such a link was created largely because of the ingenuity and ideas of Zeami Motokiyo, an actor, playwright and theoretician of Noh theater. He has utilized Zen concepts in Buddhism directly and indirectly to compile the principles of Noh theater, that is why ideas of this Eastern theater master can themselves be regarded as the manifestation of Zenism's concepts in Noh theater.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64303303, "asset_id": 43974017, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13805431, "first_name": "Morteza", "last_name": "Ghaffari", "domain_name": "tehran", "page_name": "MortezaGhaffari", "display_name": "Morteza Ghaffari", "profile_url": "https://tehran.academia.edu/MortezaGhaffari?f_ri=98424", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13805431/28066344/50082908/s65_morteza.ghaffari.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 945, "name": "Performing Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performing_Arts?f_ri=98424", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 947, "name": "Theatre Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theatre_Studies?f_ri=98424", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6716, "name": "Japanese Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_Art?f_ri=98424", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6717, "name": "Japanese Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_Buddhism?f_ri=98424", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29102, "name": "Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theatre?f_ri=98424"}, {"id": 57650, "name": "Noh theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Noh_theatre?f_ri=98424"}, {"id": 98424, "name": "Asian Theatre and Performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Theatre_and_Performance?f_ri=98424"}]}, {"id": 35290664, "title": "Drona's betrayal and Bima's brutality: Javanaiserie in Malay culture [2018]", "created_at": "2017-11-29T09:54:55.055-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35290664/Dronas_betrayal_and_Bimas_brutality_Javanaiserie_in_Malay_culture_2018_?f_ri=98424", "dom_id": "work_35290664", "summary": "The presence of elements explicitly identified as \"Javanese\" or \"from Java\" in traditional Malay literature and performance \u2014 settings, characters, objects, idioms, stories, texts, even entire genres like the renditions of Mahabharata story-matter \u2014 has mostly been ascribed to the putative prestige of the historical civilization of Java.

Javanaiserie has proven alluring in Malay contexts. Rather than as a matter of influence I suggest regarding javanaiserie as an active process of worldmaking, the creation of a reality that is culturally at once close to and distinct from an audience's

In Bali, the student imbibes technique through regular practice until tarian masuk-literally until the dance enters the body.

I also draw attention to four other Sumatran mask types, namely, those used in funeral ceremonies of the Karo Batak in North Sumatra, mak yong theater of Bintan, gobang ritual of the Anambas islands, and mendu theater of Natuna. In order to gain a greater understanding of the Sumatran mask images and to illuminate their use in performance, I first trace the history of Sumatran mask design, sourcing relevant iconographical and archeological data dating back to the migrations to the island in the Dongson era (500\u2013 1000 bce) and the subsequent Hindu-Buddhist period (first to fourteenth centuries ce). The masks' facial features and their functions in Lampung personify animals, gods, demons, and humans and resemble carvings of supernatural beings on Buddhist temple remains throughout Sumatra. The ancestors are believed to have traveled along South Sumatra's and Lampung's extensive river system to Skala Brak in West Lampung along the southwestern Bukit Barisan mountain range, bringing with them their cultures and artistic skills. Moreover, the later interethnic contact between southern Sumatrans and the Benanek Dayak community in Kalimantan may have influenced the designs of the masks, given the similarities between them in the two areas. Today Lampung sakura masking in its various forms, dating back to the pre-Hindu-Buddhist period in Skala Brak, takes place in mystical healing and village cleansing ceremonies, at pole-climbing festivals, and in street processions on the Muslim feast day of Idul Fitri. As an indirect means of affecting the people's mindset, sakura processional performance practices and their allure affirm the Lampung worldview.

Their insights provide a detailed picture of some important issues for women in Asian theatre. Margaret Coldiron is a London-based theatre director, performer, teacher and specialist in masks. She performs Balinese music and dance with Gamelan Lila Cita and Lila Bhawa Indonesian Dance Company and is the associate director of Thiasos, a theatre company specializing in intercultural productions of ancient Greek plays.

It was also to develop a kind of hybrid theatre out of the amalgamation of the two different cultures: East and West which was followed by most of the theatre practitioners as a nationalistic theatre movement. The purpose of the movement was not to going back to tradition again but to explore the tradition with new interpretations, artistic sensibilities with modern thoughts which could enrich the contemporary theatre practices in post- independence India. This was to bring out a genre of theatre: indigenous by its nature and a representative of contemporary Indian society. In the initial phase the movement was criticised by many scholars, practitioners and academics as anti-modern by blaming it as a \u2018new-traditional theatre practice\u2019. But the fact is, this theatre incorporates Indian testimony, identity and indigenous vocabulary by creating a new idiom which could confront the Western thoughts, theories and practices.

To focus on the work of Western artists in a book on women in Asian performance may seem inappropriate, even colonialist, but it is important to acknowledge that, especially in traditional arts, cultural expectations and taboos have been problematic for Asian female performers. On the other hand, women from outside Asian culture often occupy a privileged position and are granted greater freedom to pursue their interests. This chapter will use the work of two such \"pioneers\" as case studies to examine the ways that foreign female theatre artists, unbound by conventional expectations that might hinder Asian women, have asserted themselves in ways that local women might not. It will also consider whether these interventions have helped to change attitudes and create more opportunities for Asian female performers. One question that might arise at the outset is why Western women would seek to enter the doubly foreign world of an Asian theatre tradition performed by members of the opposite sex. Certainly neither of these artists set out to break gender or cultural barriers, nor were they driven to find some unique approach to an exotic form. On the contrary, both have asserted that these arts \"found\" them. Of course, this didn't happen by chance; rather, a particular set of historical and cultural circumstances came together to make these encounters possible. One element was the shift in geopolitical focus among Western nations after the Second World War from Europe to Asia, prompted by revolution in China, postcolonial tumult in South and Southeast Asia and the cautious cultural and political transition underway in postwar Japan. Moreover, the 1960s and 1970s were years that saw political, social and cultural upheaval in Europe and America, with protests against", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59109447, "asset_id":

into the conservatory dance tradition in the People's Republic of China. I propose the term \"dynamic inheritance\" to describe this officially prescribed sequence of activities, which was first formalized during the period of early socialist culture (1937-1965) and continues to be the dominant creative method followed by state-sponsored Chinese dance artists today. The most common phrase used to describe this process is \"to inherit and develop\" (jicheng yu fazhan \u7ee7\u627f\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55). It suggests that individual artists act as agents or stewards in the handing down of tradition, by following a process whose success is measured not by how strictly existing forms are preserved, but, rather, by how well they are made to speak to and be appreciated by contemporary audiences. In this process, the \"representative work\" (daibiaozuo \u4ee3\u8868\u4f5c) becomes the crucial medium through which artists carry out this process of dynamic inheritance and authorship of tradition.

Natuna regency is located in Indonesia's far north between the Malay Peninsula in the west and the Malaysian state of Serawak in the east at the southern edge of the South China Sea. Performing arts' groups in the Mempawah region of West Kalimantan also performed mendu theatre, however its history, form, style and function differ significantly from that of Natuna (and Anambas). My ethnographic video recordings of four mendu performances I attended in 1984 held in one of Natuna's main centres of the traditional arts (Ceruk and Teluk Selahang villages (kampung) near the capital Ranai) on Bunguran island, inform this study. To my knowledge these are the only recordings of the traditional Ranai-style form in existence as it was known in 1984. Mendu songs were integral to every performance, and actors structured their lyrics in pantun form. The traditional poetics and the compositional method underlying the lyrics were, and remain key to the theatre even in its rejuvenated, revitalised form.

During this formative period, Parsi theatre companies from Bombay frequented Madras and staged Urdu-language spectacles before heterogeneous audi- ences. The legacy of historical contact between Tamil drama and Parsi theatre is visible at multiple levels: nomenclature, tale types, song genres, orchestration, troupe organization, use of the proscenium stage. The positive reception of Parsi theatre in Madras, however, was not a foregone conclusion, given the linguistic, social, and cultural boundaries to be crossed. Through an analysis of Parsi company performances, this essay shows the process of creating a multilingual theatrical public at the cross- roads of urban Madras. It brings to light the patronage of an unsung sector, the community of Urdu-speaking Muslims clustered around the titular nawabs of Arcot. The sponsorship of the Begum of the Carnatic for a local troupe, the Madras Mahomedan Operatic Company, helped to dis- seminate the imported art, carrying it into wider networks of circulation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65586102, "asset_id": 44394952, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8000142, "first_name": "Kathryn", "last_name": "Hansen", "domain_name": "utexas", "page_name": "KathrynHansen", "display_name": "Kathryn Hansen", "profile_url": "https://utexas.academia.edu/KathrynHansen?f_ri=98424", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8000142/2820510/50236458/s65_kathryn.hansen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1332, "name": "Theatre History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theatre_History?f_ri=98424", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2858, "name": "Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Culture?f_ri=98424", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7570, "name": "Tamil Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tamil_Literature?f_ri=98424", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14503, "name": "Urdu Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urdu_Literature?f_ri=98424", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20771, "name": "South India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_India?f_ri=98424"}, {"id": 91581, "name": "Musical Theatre History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Musical_Theatre_History?f_ri=98424"}, {"id": 98424, "name": "Asian Theatre and Performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Theatre_and_Performance?f_ri=98424"}, {"id": 339507, "name": "Parsi Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Parsi_Theatre?f_ri=98424"}, {"id": 2499085, "name": "Indian and South Asian theatre and performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_and_South_Asian_theatre_and_performance?f_ri=98424"}, {"id": 2737347, "name": "Tamil theatre; Indian theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tamil_theatre_Indian_theatre?f_ri=98424"}]}, {"id": 34981277, "title": "Enchanting the Audience: Dramatic Devices of Sakura Mask Theatre in West Lampung, Sumatra", "created_at": "2017-10-28T02:41:52.183-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34981277/Enchanting_the_Audience_Dramatic_Devices_of_Sakura_Mask_Theatre_in_West_Lampung_Sumatra?f_ri=98424", "dom_id": "work_34981277", "summary": "Sakura is a little-known ancient genre of masked theatre found in the Indonesian prov- ince of Lampung in southern Sumatra.

As a contribution to the narratological study of the multimodal making of storyworlds, I demonstrate that wayang kulit caters for different degrees of interpretive competence, which yield different understandings of the space that wayang portrays. An expert way of apprehending space requires seeing beyond the screen, puppets, and silhouettes, or even looking away from them. At the same time the peculiar ways of narrating space in wayang point to a deeply felt spatiality in real-life contexts as well.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48507612, "asset_id": 26123169,

conventions like \u201cfourth wall\u201d illusion and asides first developed in China\u2019s Song-Yuan period and matured in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries under the special influence of new demands of city life, commerce, and print culture. As anthropologists argue that participation in markets requires temporary, imaginative suspension of other roles and identities, so suspension of disbelief in mimetic portrayals (as opposed to storytelling evocations) of fictional characters with fictional minds requires \u201cleaving one\u2019s identity at the theater door.\u201d Song-Yuan Chinese theater, like Japanese Noh of the Muromachi and later periods, accomplished this in a mediated fashion by including star characters to focus on and \u201cspectators\u2019 representative\u201d characters to identify with. Drawing inspiration from the protean, promiscuous space and punning humor of printed miscellanies and annotated vernacular fiction, the late Ming comedy Ge dai xiao \u6b4c\u4ee3\u562f (A song for a laugh) \u201cflattens\u201d the \u201casymmetric\u201d (mediated) structure of the traditional Yuan form it takes for its model by stringing together a series of loosely related vignettes featuring buffoonish \u201cside\u201d characters in a generic town setting.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64767870, "asset_id": 41878119, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

investigate the development of dance as a deeply meaningful and complex cultural practice across time, placing special focus on the intertwining of East Asia dance and politics and the role of dance as a medium of transcultural interaction and communication across borders. Countering common narratives of dance history that emphasize the US and Europe as centers of origin and innovation, the expansive creativity of dance artists in East Asia asserts its importance as a site of critical theorization and reflection on global artistic developments in the performing arts. Through the lens of \"corporeal politics\"-the close attention to bodily acts in specific cultural contexts-each study in this book challenges existing dance and theatre histories to re-investigate the performer's role in devising the politics and aesthetics of their performance, as well as the multidimensional impact of their lives and artistic works.

This is not to push for a \u201ccultural\u201d reading of Anime, to construct a \u201cJapanese\u201d lineage between Anime and Japanese traditional theater. Rather, it is an attempt to consider different means of approaching Anime, providing ways yet unexplored of how Anime create meaning in their texts, and how they (consciously and unconsciously) distance themselves from other types of animation, even in Japan (e.g. Sazae-san versus Evangelion), through the repeated performance of Anime\u2019s established conventions. Instead of looking to Manga or film or other mass-produced texts, this project looks to the theater, often overlooked multi-media productions that possess viewing modes and reading styles that can provide alternative methods for readings of Anime. Anime has become a site of various significant discourses (locally and globally), but before we determine what this performance is saying, we need to consider, on a very basic level, how it is saying it and explore various means of examining it; we need to reflect on the means of expression in the performance of the Anime form, often a crucial point of aesthetic attraction itself: Anime sells locally and globally because it exhibits itself as distinctly \u201cAnime.\u201d The Anime Paradox is thus an effort to provide an accessible discussion on Anime form and the mechanics of the type beauty represented through it from the standpoint of a critic and long-time viewer of Anime. This examination through comparison also works in the other direction, further endeavoring to enrich our understanding of theater through Anime.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 62848955, "first_name": "Stevie", "last_name": "Suan", "domain_name": "hosei", "page_name": "StevieSuan", "display_name": "Stevie Suan", "profile_url": "https://hosei.academia.edu/StevieSuan?f_ri=98424", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/62848955/16499243/36112755/s65_stevie.suan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 945, "name": "Performing Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performing_Arts?f_ri=98424", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3191, "name": "Japanese Anime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_Anime?f_ri=98424", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5498, "name": "Kabuki", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kabuki?f_ri=98424", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6000, "name": "Manga and Anime Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Manga_and_Anime_Studies?f_ri=98424", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6625, "name": "Noh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Noh?f_ri=98424"}, {"id": 98424, "name": "Asian Theatre and Performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Theatre_and_Performance?f_ri=98424"}, {"id": 107961, "name": "Anime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anime?f_ri=98424"}, {"id": 122721, "name": "Anime Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anime_Studies?f_ri=98424"}, {"id": 163905, "name": "Bunraku", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bunraku?f_ri=98424"}, {"id": 274212, "name": "Japanese noh theatre, Japanese/Asian performing arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_noh_theatre_Japanese_Asian_performing_arts?f_ri=98424"}, {"id": 352629, "name": "Japanese culture.

Il existe n\u00e9anmoins deux exceptions de taille. Les deux grands types de repr\u00e9sentations sc\u00e9niques du Toit du Monde sont les danses religieuses masqu\u00e9es (le cham) et le th\u00e9\u00e2tre populaire (l'ache lhamo), th\u00e9\u00e2tre que l'on pourrait qualifier de \"s\u00e9culier\" bien qu'il soit grandement impr\u00e9gn\u00e9 de valeurs bouddhistes. Le cham est connu et pratiqu\u00e9 dans les monast\u00e8res de toute l'aire g\u00e9ographique o\u00f9 le bouddhisme tib\u00e9tain s'est r\u00e9pandu, du Ladakh jusqu'\u00e0 la Mongolie. L'ache lhamo est connu de tous les Tib\u00e9tains, mais c'est principalement au Tibet central qu'il est le plus appr\u00e9ci\u00e9. L'une et l'autre traditions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interrompues par l'annexion chinoise \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es cinquante puis ont repris au Tibet m\u00eame, comme en exil-Inde, N\u00e9pal. La coupure a n\u00e9anmoins \u00e9t\u00e9 beaucoup plus longue en R\u00e9publique Populaire de Chine (une quinzaine d'ann\u00e9es) que dans la diaspora (deux ou trois ans, le temps n\u00e9cessaire pour s'organiser apr\u00e8s l'exil). En ce qui concerne le spectacle observable (mais non le contexte socio-politique g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), les spectacles de cham qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reconstitu\u00e9s de part et d'autre de l'Himalaya sont assez semblables. En revanche, la mani\u00e8re dont le th\u00e9\u00e2tre a \u00e9t\u00e9 revitalis\u00e9 sous l'occupation chinoise d'une part et par les exil\u00e9s d'autre part a produit des diff\u00e9rences sc\u00e9niques importantes. Le th\u00e9\u00e2tre jou\u00e9 par les troupes professionnelles de R\u00e9publique Populaire de Chine se sont \u00e9cart\u00e9es de la tradition th\u00e9\u00e2trale pr\u00e9-moderne.

Philology is usually associated with the study of manuscripts, where it is a sophisticated approach for making sense of texts. It entails a specific focus and mode of understanding. But the significance and utility of philology are not restricted to texts or manuscripts. Its scope is wider. Its approach is grounded in a cultural tendency that lives in society, namely the tendency to experience and try to understand five aspects of a cultural process or object: its artefactuality, apprehensibility, compositionality, contextuality, and historicity. If cultivated to meet the requirements of academic scholarship, this philological sensibility may form a perspective for understanding other kinds of artefacts too-especially if selectively enriched with elements from philological traditions worldwide. The author discusses examples from his own research: a manuscript with the narrative of Amir Hamza in Javanese, religious sermons in Osing on Youtube, and oral critique regarding shadow puppetry. \n\nAbstrak: Penulis mengemukakan pentingnya sebuah sikap dan keterampilan ilmiah yang disebutnya kepekaan filologis. Filologi lazim dihubungkan dengan studi naskah tulisan tangan, di mana filologi merupakan pendekatan canggih untuk mengapresiasi teks. Pendekatan tersebut membawa fokus dan cara pemahaman yang khas. Tetapi makna dan guna filologi tidak terbatas pada teks, apalagi naskah. Jangkauannya lebih luas. Pendekatan yang telah dikembangkan dalam rangka filologi teks itu berdasarkan kecenderungan kultural yang hidup di masyarakat, yaitu kecenderungan untuk menghayati dan memahami lima aspek dari sebuah proses atau benda budaya: keterbuatan, ketercerapan, ketersusunan, kontekstualitas dan kesejarahannya. Jika dipupuk sehingga memenuhi syarat ilmu pengetahuan, sensibilitas filologis tersebut bisa menjadi wawasan yang andal untuk pemahaman artefak budaya lain pula-apalagi kalau wawasan tersebut diperkaya dengan menyerap unsur-unsur terpilih dari tradisi filologi seantero dunia.

The present study aims to investigate how the discourse of Ta\u2019ziyeh is formed in connection with the displacement of spatial boundaries and how this displacement emerges as a process that turns Ta\u2019ziyeh into a performance with transformative function. In the current article, the interaction between the discourse of Ziaber Mobile Ta\u2019ziyeh (case study) and the discourse of the city is studied. Also, the effects of performing Ta\u2019ziyeh on the urban areas of Ziaber are investigated semiotically.\nResearch objectives: The main purpose of this article is to identify the semiotic aspects of mobility in the Ta\u2019ziyeh and its function in the transformation of urban places and spaces.\nResearch method: The present article has been conducted through a qualitative method based on the Paris school semiotics. The research approach is derived from post-Gremassian tradition and is the result of the transition from structuralist and classical semiotics to semiotics based on \u201cbody\u201d, \u201cperception\u201d and \u201cpresence\u201d with a phenomenological background.\nConclusion: The course of Ta\u2019ziyeh Ziaber is formed by joining the three main locations of this city (cemetery, the main street, and house of Ayatollah Ziaberi). By examining the mobile nature of this Ta\u2019ziyeh, it becomes clear how the mentioned places became narrative and move away from their previous functions and roles so that this cause transforms of places, spaces and also the transcendence of the city during the performance of Ta\u2019ziyeh.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68851438, "asset_id": 47742674, "asset_type": "Work",

The popularity of film, television,\nradio, and the cassette industries from the 1960s led to a decline\nin local audience attendance at live theatre shows. From the late\n1970s, a leading mendu theatre director allowed female\nperformers to join the previously all-male cast on stage despite\narousing controversy, thus contributing to changes in gender\nattitudes. From 2004, when the province of the Riau Islands\nprovince separated from mainland Riau and achieved autonomy,\nthe Natuna local government and commercial audiences gave\nmendu more prominence that eventually extended to the national\nlevel. Changes in the mendu style resulted from the performers\u2019\nneed to comply with new government directives. When the first\ngovernor asked the new province\u2019s regencies to select symbols of\ntheir Malay cultural identity, the Natuna regency chose mendu\ntheatre as one of its symbols, a decision that

"dom_id": "work_74513385", "summary": "Problem statement: Mobile Ta\u2019ziyeh is regarded as one of the kinds of traditional Iranian theatre in which the scenes are performed not in a permanent place, but on a certain path. The present study aims to investigate how the discourse of Ta\u2019ziyeh is formed in connection with the displacement of spatial boundaries and how this displacement emerges as a process that turns Ta\u2019ziyeh into a performance with transformative function. In the current article, the interaction between the discourse of Ziaber Mobile Ta\u2019ziyeh (case study) and the discourse of the city is studied. Also, the effects of performing Ta\u2019ziyeh on the urban areas of Ziaber are investigated semiotically.
