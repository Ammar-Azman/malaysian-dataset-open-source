Young people engaged\nin developing inclusive alternatives, particularly in the arts, are\nimportant players in the process of shifting towards more\nempowering options that incorporate cultural mix and\npermeability. Even if these do not become part of a mainstream\nimagining, they provide significant expressions of how young\npeople grapple with critical questions related to living in pluralist\ncontexts polarised by official policy. In some postcolonial\nmulticultural societies, such as Malaysia and Singapore, the spaces\nto play with culture and experiment with crossing boundaries are\nrare, due to acute sensitivities about race, religion and language.\nYouth theatre, which is largely school-based and thus restrained\nby institutional goals and expectations, seldom offers young\npeople a chance to reflect openly about issues that affect them.\nThus, questions arise about how theatre-making for and with\nyoung people can be pushed towards meaningful cultural\nengagement, that empowers participants, and those who facilitate\nthese programmes, with frameworks that help youth enact and\nembody bold, critical and empathetic envisionings of cultural\ndifference.\nThis article examines the importance of play as a dynamic that\nproduces inclusivity, particularly in culturally complex terrains that\nstruggle to deal with multicultural negotiation. It advocates the\nimportance of playful encounters with difference, and argues for\nmulticultural play as an important foundational process in working\nacross lines of difference. It draws on the work of Krishen Jit and\nKuo Pao Kun, pioneering contemporary theatre directors, writers\nand educators in Malaysia and Singapore, whose theatre practice\nand philosophy underlined the importance of multicultural play, and\nthus provided critical examples of how difference could be engaged\nas a positive dynamic through \u2018Open Culture\u2019 (Kuo, P.

How to make sense of the shadow-play as a form of world-making? In Tall Tree, Nest of the Wind, Bernard Arps explores this question by considering an all-night performance of Dewa Ruci, a key play in the repertoire. Thrilling and profound, Dewa Ruci describes the mighty Bratasena\u2019s quest for the ultimate mystical insight.\n     The book presents  Dewa Ruci as rendered by the distinguished master puppeteer Ki Anom Soeroto in Amsterdam in 1987. The book\u2019s unusual design presents the performance texts together with descriptions of the sounds and images that would remain obscure in conventional formats of presentation. Copious annotations probe beneath the surface and provide an understanding of the performance's cultural complexity. These annotations explain the meanings of puppet action, music, and shifts in language; how the puppeteer wove together into the drama the circumstances of the performance in Amsterdam, Islamic and other religious ideas, and references to contemporary Indonesian political ideology. Also revealed is the performance\u2019s historical multilayering and the picture it paints of the Javanese past.\n     Tall Tree, Nest of the Wind not only presents an unrivalled insight into the artistic depth of wayang kulit, it exemplifies a new field of study, the philology of performance.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45693702, "asset_id": 22488991, "asset_type": "Work",

cultural formation and identity must exceed the nation-state\u2019s purview. The present, \u201cglobalised\u201d moment requires freedom from local jurisdictions: this is the line of thought regarding a truly contemporary theatre\u2019s direction cut short by his demise in 2002. Two plays represent Kuo\u2019s new direction: \"Descendants of the Eunuch Admiral\" (1995) and the \"The Spirits Play\" (1998 and 2000). His deliberations on contemporary art and culture draw from older ideals of modern cultural formation and is conjoined, it may be contradictorily, with postmodernism\u2019s rhetoric of the decentred and the multiple; but if so, this contradiction becomes an adumbration of the fraught attributes of the contemporary.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65167919, "asset_id": 44692123, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7346585, "first_name": "C.

I also draw attention to four other Sumatran mask types, namely, those used in funeral ceremonies of the Karo Batak in North Sumatra, mak yong theater of Bintan, gobang ritual of the Anambas islands, and mendu theater of Natuna. In order to gain a greater understanding of the Sumatran mask images and to illuminate their use in performance, I first trace the history of Sumatran mask design, sourcing relevant iconographical and archeological data dating back to the migrations to the island in the Dongson era (500\u2013 1000 bce) and the subsequent Hindu-Buddhist period (first to fourteenth centuries ce). The masks' facial features and their functions in Lampung personify animals, gods, demons, and humans and resemble carvings of supernatural beings on Buddhist temple remains throughout Sumatra. The ancestors are believed to have traveled along South Sumatra's and Lampung's extensive river system to Skala Brak in West Lampung along the southwestern Bukit Barisan mountain range, bringing with them their cultures and artistic skills. Moreover, the later interethnic contact between southern Sumatrans and the Benanek Dayak community in Kalimantan may have influenced the designs of the masks, given the similarities between them in the two areas. Today Lampung sakura masking in its various forms, dating back to the pre-Hindu-Buddhist period in Skala Brak, takes place in mystical healing and village cleansing ceremonies, at pole-climbing festivals, and in street processions on the Muslim feast day of Idul Fitri.

As a contribution to the narratological study of the multimodal making of storyworlds, I demonstrate that wayang kulit caters for different degrees of interpretive competence, which yield different understandings of the space that wayang portrays. An expert way of apprehending space requires seeing beyond the screen, puppets, and silhouettes, or even looking away from them. At the same time the peculiar ways of narrating space in wayang point to a deeply felt spatiality in real-life contexts as well.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48507612, "asset_id": 26123169,

"work_35423259", "summary": "Popular at the turn of the 20 th century but in serious decline since the early 1980s, the little-known traditional genre of mendu theatre in the Natuna archipelago (also performed in the neighbouring Anambas archipelago) staged episodes of the mythical Dewa Mendu story as in the literary epic Hikayat Dewa Mandu (Story of Dewa Mandu). Natuna regency is located in Indonesia's far north between the Malay Peninsula in the west and the Malaysian state of Serawak in the east at the southern edge of the South China Sea. Performing arts' groups in the Mempawah region of West Kalimantan also performed mendu theatre, however its history, form, style and function differ significantly from that of Natuna (and Anambas). My ethnographic video recordings of four mendu performances I attended in 1984 held in one of Natuna's main centres of the traditional arts (Ceruk and Teluk Selahang villages (kampung) near the capital Ranai) on Bunguran island, inform this study. To my knowledge these are the only recordings of the traditional Ranai-style form in existence as it was known in 1984. Mendu songs were integral to every performance, and actors structured their lyrics 1 The original field research on mendu theatre conducted on Natuna's Bunguran island in 1984, formed the basis of my BA Honours thesis (1986), written jointly at Monash University and the University of California under the careful supervision of the late professors Cyril Skinner and Amin Sweeney respectively, both of whom introduced me to Malay literary and oral traditions. This study would not have been possible without, firstly, the generous assistance of Bp Idrus M.T., senior high school teacher, and Bp Syamsuddin from the office of the District Head in Ranai, who organised the four mendu performances we recorded, and secondly the directors and the many actors, musicians and assistants, in particular Bp Bujang Ahmad, who made these performances possible. I am grateful to my interlocutors the late Bp Ahmadiah Zulman, Ibu Sulfarini, Ibu Erlina SH, and Bp Jafri Dusai among others, who kindly and patiently shared their deep knowledge with me, and the researchers and theatre directors of mendu theatre, namely the late Bp Asmui Bakar, Bp Syafaruddin, and Bp S. Ismail, who documented four of the six sets of lyrics included in part 2 of this study. My thanks to the late Bp Tenas Effendy, well known author and guardian of Malay culture from Pekanbaru, ethnomusicologist Ashley Turner with whom I travelled to Natuna in 1984, to the then Monash Music Department for the loan of a video recorder, and to the Monash University Music Archives for the loan of photographic and recording equipment to record a mendu performance in 2013. My thanks to Professor Stuart Robson for his criticisms and useful suggestions for this article; Professor Harry Aveling for his encouragement and expertise in Indonesian-Malay translation of song-lyrics-any errors are my own; Dr Gijs Koster for his insights in the Hikayat Dewa Mandu among other hikayat; Jesse Kartomi Thomas for helping with editing earlier drafts of this article; and the editors of IJIS Yacinta Kurniasih and Matthew Piscioneri for their kind editorial assistance at every step of the way.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55284083, "asset_id": 35423259, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10153924, "first_name": "Karen Kartomi", "last_name": "Thomas", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "kthomas", "display_name": "Karen Kartomi  Thomas", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/kthomas?f_ri=627205", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10153924/18451763/18405028/s65_karen_kartomi.thomas.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=627205", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=627205", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16827, "name": "Asian Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Theatre?f_ri=627205", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 533796, "name": "Kepulauan Natuna", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kepulauan_Natuna?f_ri=627205", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 627205, "name": "Southeast Asian theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_theatre?f_ri=627205"}, {"id": 1695634, "name": "Malay Indonesian Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Indonesian_Theatre?f_ri=627205"}, {"id": 2842456, "name": "Indonesian and Malay Theatre and Performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_and_Malay_Theatre_and_Performance?f_ri=627205"}, {"id": 2842457, "name": "Arts in Natuna, South China Sea", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arts_in_Natuna_South_China_Sea?f_ri=627205"}]}, {"id": 4214161, "title": "The Most Famous Play of William Shakespeare among HS students of SJSF", "created_at": "2013-08-10T22:29:04.794-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4214161/The_Most_Famous_Play_of_William_Shakespeare_among_HS_students_of_SJSF?f_ri=627205", "dom_id": "work_4214161", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31703993, "asset_id": 4214161, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5099651, "first_name": "Lorraine", "last_name": "Lacuesta", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "LorraineLacuesta", "display_name": "Lorraine Lacuesta", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/LorraineLacuesta?f_ri=627205", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=627205", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2739, "name": "Play", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Play?f_ri=627205", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3146, "name": "Shakespeare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shakespeare?f_ri=627205", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30347, "name": "Translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation?f_ri=627205", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56581, "name": "Othello", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Othello?f_ri=627205"}, {"id": 57381, "name": "Hamlet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hamlet?f_ri=627205"}, {"id": 57382, "name": "Macbeth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Macbeth?f_ri=627205"}, {"id": 85841, "name": "King Lear", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/King_Lear?f_ri=627205"}, {"id": 182509, "name": "Romeo and Juliet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Romeo_and_Juliet?f_ri=627205"}, {"id": 627205, "name": "Southeast Asian theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_theatre?f_ri=627205"}, {"id": 652333, "name": "Stylization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stylization?f_ri=627205"}, {"id": 917451, "name": "Adaptations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Adaptations?f_ri=627205"}, {"id": 1000623, "name": "East Asian Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Asian_Theatre?f_ri=627205"}, {"id": 1000626, "name": "The Taming of the Shrew", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Taming_of_the_Shrew?f_ri=627205"}]}, {"id": 36669280, "title": "'Nh\u01b0 c\u00e1 v\u1edbi n\u01b0\u1edbc \u2013 Like fish and water': An ethnographic study of instrumental music, timbre and sentiment in Vietnamese tu\u1ed3ng opera", "created_at": "2018-05-19T06:14:55.198-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36669280/Nh%C6%B0_c%C3%A1_v%E1%BB%9Bi_n%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Bc_Like_fish_and_water_An_ethnographic_study_of_instrumental_music_timbre_and_sentiment_in_Vietnamese_tu%E1%BB%93ng_opera?f_ri=627205", "dom_id": "work_36669280", "summary": "PhD thesis in Ethnomusicology, awarded 2017.

Although its importance has been acknowledged due to its role as the predecessor of the South and Southeast Asian \u2018modern\u2019 theatre, there exists to this date no published critical history of the politics of its professionalisation and transregional expansion. This article will serve as a corrective measure, filling in the gap in existing research through a comparative analysis of the reception of the Parsi theatre marked by the Victoria N\u0101\u1e6dak Ma\u1e47\u1e0dali's (Victoria Theatrical Company's) decision to tour Burma in 1881 and subsequently to participate in the Colonial and Indian Exhibition of 1886 in London. As a vehicle of increasingly globalised mass consumption practices, the Parsi theatre was a resounding success in Southeast Asia, inspiring the creation of \u2018imitation Parsi theatre\u2019 in present-day Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. In stark comparison, the Parsi theatre's portrayal of a cosmopolitan, urban, industrially advanced orient was \u2018doomed to disappointment\u2019 in London and was an unequivocal financial failure.

In a substantial introductory essay and essays by leading scholars, activists and practitioners working inside the region, the book explores fundamental questions for the arts.  The book asks how theatre contributes to and/or addresses the political condition in the contemporary moment, how does it represent the complexity of experiences in peoples\u2019 daily lives and how does theatre engage in forms of political activism and enable a diversity of voices to flourish.  The book shows how, in an age of increasingly violent politics, political institutions become sites for bad actors and propaganda.  Forces of biopolitics, neo-liberalism and religious and ethnic nationalism intersect in unpredictable ways with decolonial practices \u2013 all of which the book argues are forces that define the contemporary moment.  Indeed, by putting the focus on contemporary politics in the region alongside the diversity of practices in contemporary theatre, we see a substantial reformation of the idea of the contemporary moment, not as a cosmopolitan and elite artistic practice but as a multivalent agent of change in both aesthetic and political terms.  With its focus on community activism and the creative possibilities of the performing arts the region, Performing Southeast Asia, is a timely intervention that brings us to a new understanding of how contemporary Southeast Asia has become a site of contest, struggle and reinvention of the relations between the arts and society.\n\n~ Peter Eckersall\nThe Graduate Center, City University of New York", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63327192, "asset_id": 43068426, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3304216, "first_name": "Marcus", "last_name": "Tan", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "MarcusTan", "display_name": "Marcus Tan", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/MarcusTan?f_ri=627205", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3304216/1100376/2916493/s65_marcus.tan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 16790, "name": "Political theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_theatre?f_ri=627205", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25845, "name": "Southeast Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Politics?f_ri=627205", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 331279, "name": "Theatre Studies political theatre contemporary theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theatre_Studies_political_theatre_contemporary_theatre?f_ri=627205", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 627205, "name": "Southeast Asian theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_theatre?f_ri=627205", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 28609277, "title": "Indonesia and the Malay World Theatrical Change Paralleling Socio-POlitical Developments in Indonesia's Natuna Archipelago in the South China Sea", "created_at": "2016-09-19T16:35:40.493-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28609277/Indonesia_and_the_Malay_World_Theatrical_Change_Paralleling_Socio_POlitical_Developments_in_Indonesias_Natuna_Archipelago_in_the_South_China_Sea?f_ri=627205", "dom_id": "work_28609277", "summary": "Radical changes in the performance practice of a Malay theatre form\ncalled mendu, located in the Natuna Islands in the South China Sea,\nhave paralleled major socio-political change.

Apart from indigenous cultures that have survived the tides of change, there are several deeply embedded cultural influences from near and far that constitute what is local. Education that engages with this complexity must- negotiate the borderlines of culture that contribute to how Southeast Asian nations apprehend themselves, and in relation to each other. In this article, I propose a critical approach to \u201cregionalist\u201d education in Southeast Asia by engaging with issues of culture in teaching and learning contemporary theatre. I deploy Henry Giroux\u2019s border pedagogy as a working frame to grapple with difference in Southeast Asia, with particular reference to his view that borders are expressions of power that need to be inter- rogated through pedagogies of difference. I then describe and analyse how the learning process and assessment tasks created for an undergraduate module on Contemporary Theatre in Southeast Asia at a teacher-education institution in Singapore offer students a space to work with pedagogies of \u201cdifference\u201d and \u201cdiscomfort\u201d and reconfigure the boundaries of their identities and communities as potentially local, regional and global.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64778082, "asset_id": 44377115, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2819089, "first_name": "Charlene", "last_name": "Rajendran", "domain_name": "nie-sg", "page_name": "CharleneRajendran", "display_name": "Charlene Rajendran", "profile_url": "https://nie-sg.academia.edu/CharleneRajendran?f_ri=627205", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2819089/921177/1153012/s65_charlene.rajendran.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3294, "name": "Dramaturgy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dramaturgy?f_ri=627205", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 87997, "name": "Drama/Theatre in Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Drama_Theatre_in_Education?f_ri=627205", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 99868, "name": "Border Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Border_Pedagogy?f_ri=627205", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 187579, "name": "Cultural difference", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_difference?f_ri=627205", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 527118, "name": "Embodied Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Embodied_Learning?f_ri=627205"}, {"id": 627205, "name": "Southeast Asian theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_theatre?f_ri=627205"}]}, {"id": 31435469, "title": "Persistent Mutualisms: Energizing the Symbiotic Relationship Between Balinese Dancer and Drummer", "created_at": "2017-02-14T17:01:42.227-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31435469/Persistent_Mutualisms_Energizing_the_Symbiotic_Relationship_Between_Balinese_Dancer_and_Drummer?f_ri=627205", "dom_id": "work_31435469", "summary": "Recognizing enduring aspects of expressive culture is paramount in the discourse of musical diversity. With a gaze cast on identifying difference, researchers may take note of persistent patterns across temporal and stylistic boundaries telling us what constitutes an \u2018essentiality\u2019 in the musical expressions of a given culture (Hood 2010a). One such enduring aspect of expressive culture is the relationship between movement arts and its percussive accompaniment. This interdependent relationship, found principally between dancers and drummers, permeates Southeast Asian performing arts (Campbell 2011; Gerstin 1998; Hood 2013; Williams 2011). It pervades in both historical forms related to classical/ traditional/ritual genres as well as contemporary forms that belong to the modern/contemporary/secular. One such example comes from the myriad classical and contemporary Balinese music and dance forms that continue to see the percussive attacks and rapid rhythms of gupekan drumming as an essential sonic accompaniment for the highly stylized court- and folk-based masolah dancing.\nPercussive accompaniment for dance, however, is not the only essential aesthetic in this relationship. Dancers feel the modal underpinnings of gamelan melodies punctuated with gongs and metallophones in cyclical movement. Drummers command orchestral troupes while interpreting rhythmic, agogic and leadership functions as they act on their library of tacit knowledge of dramatic storyline, epic literature and even ritual performance functions. Yet, despite these influential aesthetic interrelationships, dancers continue to demand the attention of their percussive partners.
