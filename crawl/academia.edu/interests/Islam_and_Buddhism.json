The book is divided into four parts, focusing respectively on: theories of prejudice and violence; historical developments of antisemitism, Islamophobia, and race; contemporary Western antisemitism and Islamophobia; and, prejudices beyond the West in the Islamic, Buddhist, and Hindu traditions. Each part ends with a special focus section.\n\nKey features include:\n- A compelling synthesis of theories of prejudice, identity, and hatred to explain Islamophobia and antisemitism.\n- An innovative theory of human violence and genocide which explains the link to prejudice.\n- Case studies of both Western antisemitism and Islamophobia in history and today, alongside global studies of Islamic antisemitism and Hindu and Buddhist Islamophobia\n- Integrates discussion of race and racialisation as aspects of Islamophobic and antisemitic prejudice in relation to their framing in religious discourses.\n- Accessible for general readers and students, it can be employed as a textbook for students or read with benefit by scholars for its novel synthesis and theories.\n\nThe book focuses on antisemitism and Islamophobia, both in the West and beyond, including examples of prejudices and hatred in the Islamic, Hindu, and Buddhist traditions. Drawing on examples from Europe, North America, MENA, South and Southeast Asia, and Africa, Paul Hedges points to common patterns, while identifying the specifics of local context.\nReligious Hatred is an essential guide for understanding the historical origins of religious hatred, the manifestations of this hatred across diverse religious and cultural contexts, and the strategies employed by activists and peacemakers to overcome this hatred.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68022380, "asset_id": 49791254, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 69600, "first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Hedges", "domain_name": "rsis", "page_name": "PaulHedges", "display_name": "Paul  Hedges", "profile_url": "https://rsis.academia.edu/PaulHedges?f_ri=2116992", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/69600/19491/15881201/s65_paul.hedges.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3972, "name": "Genocide Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genocide_Studies?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5531, "name": "Antisemitism (Prejudice)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Antisemitism_Prejudice_?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5686, "name": "Political Violence and Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Violence_and_Terrorism?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5906, "name": "Prejudice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prejudice?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 6245, "name": "Stereotypes and Prejudice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stereotypes_and_Prejudice?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 9086, "name": "Hate Speech", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hate_Speech?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 12742, "name": "Holocaust Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Holocaust_Studies?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 16356, "name": "Antisemitism/Racisms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Antisemitism_Racisms?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 17501, "name": "Islamophobia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamophobia?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 43152, "name": "antisemitism and Islamophobia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/antisemitism_and_Islamophobia?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 43575, "name": "Holocaust", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Holocaust?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 51753, "name": "Genocide", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genocide?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 54355, "name": "Antisemitism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Antisemitism?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 87413, "name": "Christian Antisemitism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christian_Antisemitism?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 94860, "name": "Islam and Christianity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Christianity?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 166370, "name": "Islamophobia and Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamophobia_and_Media?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 880005, "name": "islam and Hinduism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/islam_and_Hinduism?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 1008054, "name": "Islamophobia In Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamophobia_In_Europe?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 2116992, "name": "Islam and Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Buddhism?f_ri=2116992"}]}, {"id": 45320607, "title": "Maitreya Misquote", "created_at": "2021-03-02T20:44:44.457-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45320607/Maitreya_Misquote?f_ri=2116992", "dom_id": "work_45320607", "summary": "Maitreya (Sanskrit), or Metteyya (Pali), is regarded as a future Buddha.

They've managed to stir up public reaction and attract interest at the same time.\n\nIn recent years, Western societies have seen the emergence of an unusual current that draws attention to itself by its rather strange life style. It's made up of individuals who want to attract attention by adopting Eastern culture, beliefs, and philosophies\u2014of which the most important is Buddhism.\nThroughout the world, but especially in America and Europe, some individuals have been intrigued by Buddhism, spurred on mostly by the superstitious, secret, and awesome qualities they perceive in this religion. Generally, those who adopt Buddhism do so not because they believe in the logic of its philosophy, but because they're attracted by its \"mystical\" atmosphere, drawn to this superstition because it is presented to them as far more different and awesome than any other philosophy they encounter in their normal lives. For example, the story of how Buddhism came to be is related to them as a fantastic, mystic legend. Books and films about Buddhism depict Buddha as the source of a great mystery. Likewise, Buddhist priests are presented as possessors of secret, arcane knowledge. They fascinate Westerners with their exotic robes, shaved heads, style of worship, elaborate ceremonies, dwelling places, meditation, yoga and other such strange practices.",

So, the main objective of this article is to analyze the concept of social cohesion from the religious scop of  Islam and Buddhism. This study contributes to objectively clarifying the similarities between the two paths and explaining their phenomenological parallels and structural affinities. Within this context, the paper focuses on exploring the views of Islam and  Buddhism towards social cohesion to use as textual evidence for resolving religious conflicts and ethnic unrest in places where Muslims and Buddhists live together. To achieve this end, the research comparatively examines the dynamics of social cohesion as described in Islam and  Buddhism with the concern of the inner dimension and outer dimension of the subject matter. This research applies qualitative methodology,  in which the researchers use data that includes textual analysis on written materials such as books,  articles,  and internet sources.  The findings reveal that both religions share a similar scope of social cohesion which contains theoretically accepting diversity,  and loving compassion with others practically. Both religions prioritize human dignity as the main standard in social cohesion. This study guides to eliminate misunderstandings about religions: Islam, and  Buddhism, and to succeed in  a  process of reconciliation and for peaceful engagement among the diverse religious groups.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68991040, "asset_id": 51152818, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30566929, "first_name": "Mohamed", "last_name": "Ashath (Ashath Siraas)", "domain_name": "iium", "page_name": "AshathSiraas", "display_name": "Mohamed Ashath (Ashath Siraas)", "profile_url": "https://iium.academia.edu/AshathSiraas?f_ri=2116992", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30566929/8886060/34653080/s65_ashath.siraas.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 193087, "name": "Comparative Study of World Religions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Study_of_World_Religions?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 924737, "name": "Buddhist-Muslim Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist-Muslim_Relations?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1005546, "name": "Comparative Philosophy and Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Philosophy_and_Religion?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1015333, "name": "Religious Harmony", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Harmony?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2064144, "name": "Buddhism and Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism_and_Islam?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 2116992, "name": "Islam and Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Buddhism?f_ri=2116992"}]}, {"id": 50615906, "title": "PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE THROUGH  THE CONCEPTS OF BRAHMAVIH\u0100R\u0100S OF BUDDHISM AND MAQ\u0100\u1e62ID AL-SHAR\u012a\u02bfA OF ISLAM: A CONTENT ANALYSIS", "created_at": "2021-08-02T23:00:28.858-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/50615906/PEACEFUL_COEXISTENCE_THROUGH_THE_CONCEPTS_OF_BRAHMAVIH%C4%80R%C4%80S_OF_BUDDHISM_AND_MAQ%C4%80%E1%B9%A2ID_AL_SHAR%C4%AA%CA%BFA_OF_ISLAM_A_CONTENT_ANALYSIS?f_ri=2116992", "dom_id": "work_50615906", "summary": "To understand every religion, it is vital to study the main sources, the specific religious scriptures of a particular religion. In order to draw a conclusion about the core message of religion, it is not scientific to observe only the practices of the adherents of a certain religion. Although Buddhism and Islam have been considered as religions of peace, the meeting of Buddhists and Muslims is most often imagined as one of violent confrontation in the modern world. There should be an understanding between Buddhism and Islam to ensure peaceful coexistence among the adherents. Based on the arguments,this study aims to analyze peaceful coexistence through two different concepts, Brahmavih\u0101r\u0101s from Buddhism and Maq\u0101\u1e63idh al-Shar\u012b\u02bfa from Islam. Primarily it seeks to analyze these two concepts within their respective religions for a better comparison. It uses a library-based qualitative method. For this purpose, the research adopts the content analysis method, which focuses on the materials from journals, books, written reports, and other materials. The study highlights that even though Buddhism and Islam have different doctrinal foundations, the basic teachings promote peaceful coexistence from different points of view. This research concludes that both religions share similar concepts of peaceful coexistence which denote and declare human dignity as a right that should be paid attention. Both religions prioritize love and justice as the main standard in discussing peaceful coexistence. \nHopefully, this conceptual study will be able to show that these two ideas are very significant and valuable when dealing with religious conflicts, to make a better inter-religious understanding among Buddhists and Muslims and to succeed in a process of reconciliation and for peaceful coexistence among diverse religious people.\n\nKeywords: Buddhism, Islam, Peaceful Coexistence, Conceptual Ideas, Brahmavih\u0101r\u0101s, Maqasidh Shari'a", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68548063, "asset_id": 50615906, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30566929, "first_name": "Mohamed", "last_name": "Ashath (Ashath Siraas)", "domain_name": "iium", "page_name": "AshathSiraas", "display_name": "Mohamed Ashath (Ashath Siraas)", "profile_url": "https://iium.academia.edu/AshathSiraas?f_ri=2116992", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30566929/8886060/34653080/s65_ashath.siraas.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 122, "name": "Comparative Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Religion?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27711, "name": "Interreligious Dialogue and Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interreligious_Dialogue_and_Education?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47174, "name": "World Peace through Similarities between Different Religions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Peace_through_Similarities_between_Different_Religions?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 193087, "name": "Comparative Study of World Religions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Study_of_World_Religions?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 438627, "name": "dialogue between Islam and Buddhism through the Concepts of Tathagata and Nur Muhammadi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/dialogue_between_Islam_and_Buddhism_through_the_Concepts_of_Tathagata_and_Nur_Muhammadi?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 461898, "name": "Interreligious and Intercultural Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interreligious_and_Intercultural_Relations?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 2116992, "name": "Islam and Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Buddhism?f_ri=2116992"}]}, {"id": 47773515, "title": "MUSLIM BUDDHIST DIALOGUE: A QUEST FOR ETHNIC HARMONY IN THE SRI LANKAN CONTEXT", "created_at": "2021-04-29T00:23:00.572-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/47773515/MUSLIM_BUDDHIST_DIALOGUE_A_QUEST_FOR_ETHNIC_HARMONY_IN_THE_SRI_LANKAN_CONTEXT?f_ri=2116992", "dom_id": "work_47773515", "summary": "Abstract\nM.Z.M. Nafeel\nAlthough there are differences in the belief systems of Islam and Buddhism, there are some shared values that could form a strong basis for dialogue between these two religions. Dialogue of religion involves creating an understanding for people of different faiths to live together in peace and harmony. It is necessary that they should understand each other\u2019s religions, culture and traditions and learn to respect whatever they find good therein. When two civilizations meet, there is always a two-way process of interaction between them, both being influenced and molded by each other. Such interaction must not be seen as necessarily negative, because human existence is based on the principle of give and take. Therefore, along the line of ethics, and in particular on universal humanistic values and social responsibilities Muslims and Buddhists can work together for peace and a harmonious pluralistic living, in order to produce good socialized members who will work towards the progress of the country of Sri Lanka.\nKeywords\nDialogue, pluralism, civilization", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66715422, "asset_id": 47773515, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 176410006, "first_name": "Nafeel", "last_name": "Zawahir", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "Zawahir", "display_name": "Nafeel Zawahir", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/Zawahir?f_ri=2116992", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/176410006/54771824/42929234/s65_nafeel.zawahir.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 122, "name": "Comparative Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Religion?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1230, "name": "Social Research Methods and Methodology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Research_Methods_and_Methodology?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2065, "name": "Research Methodology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Research_Methodology?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 37114, "name": "Islam and the West", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_the_West-1?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38097, "name": "Interfaith Dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interfaith_Dialogue?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 45775, "name": "Islam and International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_International_Relations?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 1223709, "name": "Islamic law and jurisprudence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_law_and_jurisprudence-1?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 2116992, "name": "Islam and Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Buddhism?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 3812999, "name": "sri lankan muslims", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/sri_lankan_muslims?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 3965103, "name": "Islam in Sri Lankan Context", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Sri_Lankan_Context?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 3965105, "name": "Peace and Development for Nation Building", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Development_for_Nation_Building-1?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 3965106, "name": "Muslim Minority Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslim_Minority_Law?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 3965107, "name": "Islam in South and South East Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_South_and_South_East_Asia?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 3965108, "name": "Modern Interpretation of Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Interpretation_of_Islam?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 3965109, "name": "Coexistence and Ethnic Harmony", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coexistence_and_Ethnic_Harmony?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 3965110, "name": "Research in the Perspective of Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Research_in_the_Perspective_of_Islam?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 3965111, "name": "Islam and Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Multiculturalism?f_ri=2116992"}, {"id": 3965112, "name": "Problems of Teaching and Learning Arabic Language for Non-native Speakers of Arabic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Problems_of_Teaching_and_Learning_Arabic_Language_for_Non_native_Speakers_of_Arabic?f_ri=2116992"}]}, {"id": 44772348, "title": "Buddhism according to Modern Muslim Exegetes", "created_at": "2020-12-25T05:11:49.397-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44772348/Buddhism_according_to_Modern_Muslim_Exegetes?f_ri=2116992", "dom_id": "work_44772348", "summary": "This paper offers preliminary notes on Buddhism in modern Muslim exegesis with an emphasis on Tafsir al-Qasimi by Muhammad Jamal al-Din al-Qasimi (1866\u20131914) and al-Mizan fi Tafsir al-Qur\u02bean by Muhammad Husayn Tabataba\u02bei (1892\u20131981). The research adopts a qualitative design using content analysis to collect the data. In this paper two main questions regarding both exegetes will be explored. The first question concerns the sources of both scholars for their information about Buddhism by including the discussion in their exegesis. The second question concerns the methodology they used to discuss Buddhism in the Qur\u02bean since this has not been done by any classical exegetes nor among the most modern exegetes. Studies have found that the approach of the two exegetes is different from both the classical and modern exegetes because their work also contains resources from the fields of comparative religion and the history of religion to make their work relevant in the current context and reliable to be referred to by any parties. The author concludes that both al-Qasimi and Tabataba\u02bei used analysis (ta\u1e25lil) in discussing verses related to the position of the Buddha.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65281446, "asset_id": 44772348, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 45294585, "first_name": "Jaffary", "last_name": "Awang", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JaffaryAwang", "display_name": "Jaffary Awang", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JaffaryAwang?f_ri=2116992", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/45294585/35779620/30898223/s65_jaffary.awang.png"}, {"id": 11362140, "first_name": "Ahmad Faizuddin", "last_name": "Ramli", "domain_name": "upsi-my", "page_name": "AhmadFaizuddin", "display_name": "Ahmad Faizuddin Ramli", "profile_url": "https://upsi-my.academia.edu/AhmadFaizuddin?f_ri=2116992", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11362140/3321290/40122118/s65_ahmad_faizuddin.ramli.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 47698, "name": "Quranic Exegesis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Quranic_Exegesis?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 924737, "name": "Buddhist-Muslim Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist-Muslim_Relations?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2116992, "name": "Islam and Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Buddhism?f_ri=2116992", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 38169641, "title": "\u0631\u0648\u0627\u06cc\u062a \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u06cc\u0632\u0648\u062a\u0633\u0648 \u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646\u200c\u067e\u0698\u0648\u0647 \u0698\u0627\u067e\u0646\u06cc", "created_at": "2019-01-17T08:19:34.773-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38169641/%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AA_%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C_%D8%A7%D8%B2_%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B3%D9%88_%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A2%D9%86_%D9%BE%DA%98%D9%88%D9%87_%DA%98%D8%A7%D9%BE%D9%86%DB%8C?f_ri=2116992", "dom_id": "work_38169641", "summary": "\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u062e\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u062d\u0648\u0627\u0644\u060c \u0622\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u0648 \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u062b \u0627\u06cc\u0632\u0648\u062a\u0633\u0648 \u0633\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0648 \u0628\u0647 \u0646\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0634 \u062f\u0631 \u0622\u0645\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a. \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0646\u062f\u060c \u06a9\u0647 \u00ab\u0634\u0631\u0642\u06cc\u00bb \u0646\u0627\u0645 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f\u060c \u0633\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0646\u062f\u0633\u0627\u0632 \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f \u0637\u0627\u0647\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a. \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06cc\u0627\u062f\u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u060c \u0631\u0648\u0627\u06cc\u062a\u06cc \u06af\u0630\u0631\u0627 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u06cc\u0632\u0648\u062a\u0633\u0648 \u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0686\u0647 \u062f\u0648\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u067e\u0631\u0633\u0634\u06af\u0631 \u0648 \u062f\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u06af\u0631\u062f \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0646\u062f \u0628\u0647 \u062f\u0633\u062a \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062f\u0647\u062f.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58204421, "asset_id": 38169641, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1097598, "first_name": "S.

As a result of the interactions and relationships in the areas of science, literature, medicine and the architecture, Islamic civilization reached its peak in that era, particularly during the Abbasid period (750-1258 AD). Thus, this article discusses in detail what type of the Muslim-Buddhist relationship is, and how it contributes to Islamic civilization.

Thus, in this article, we provide a preliminary analysis of Buddhist-Muslim relations from past to present as it unfolds the various forms of relations, conflicts, and harmonies. This article also analyses the driving factors that contribute to the relation of both religious societies in terms of politics, religion, and economics. This research is qualitative. The research method used is descriptive-analytical by emphasizing content analysis of data information from various books and articles covering the Muslim and Buddhism encounters. Despite certain polemics having occurred along the relationship, the study shows that Muslim-Buddhist encounter occurred in harmony, particularly when relation was rooted in tolerance.

The research adopts a qualitative design using content analysis to collect the data. In this paper two main questions regarding both exegetes will be explored. The first question concerns the sources of both scholars for their information about Buddhism by including the discussion in their exegesis.
