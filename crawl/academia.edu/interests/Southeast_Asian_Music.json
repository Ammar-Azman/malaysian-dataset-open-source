This performing art has been continuously developing across the centuries, since the Majapahit Empire (ca. 9th century) until nowadays. During the Dutch Rule (ca. 17th-20th century) the performance practice of wayang kulit had undergone a standardization, thus crystallizing into the \u201cclassical\u201d form. However, wayang kulit has continued to evolve, and still now external influences determines interesting changes in its performance practice. The two comic interludes (Limbukan and Gara-Gara) offer the greatest possibility to insert innovations in the \u201cclassical\u201d format. In particular the Limbukan, the most recently added, constitutes the highest breaking point of the \u201cclassical\u201d structure: it represents an open sequence, not linked with the mythological narration of the wayang. Here, new humorous spectacular practices and musical repertoires lead by female protagonists (sindhen) take place. This paper investigates the most relevant changes happening in this comic interlude: on one hand the interaction between the sindhen and the dhalang (puppeteer), on the other hand the mix of traditional and contemporary genres in musical repertoires. In order to show these innovations, I will take as an example the Limbukan performed by the famous dalang Ki Nugroho Suseno on March, 2015 in Yogyakarta.\n\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50643868, "asset_id": 30178548, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17807766, "first_name": "Ilaria", "last_name": "Meloni", "domain_name": "uniroma", "page_name": "IlariaMeloni", "display_name": "Ilaria Meloni", "profile_url": "https://uniroma.academia.edu/IlariaMeloni?f_ri=1159480", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/17807766/4975722/15793543/s65_ilaria.meloni.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1987, "name": "Ethnomusicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnomusicology?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 558117, "name": "Innovations and Changes in the field of Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Innovations_and_Changes_in_the_field_of_Music?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1159480, "name": "Southeast Asian Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Music?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2555419, "name": "Music and music education within the context of socio-cultural changes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music_and_music_education_within_the_context_of_socio-cultural_changes?f_ri=1159480"}]}, {"id": 40279116, "title": "Music and the cline of Malayness: sounds of egalitarianism and ranking", "created_at": "2019-09-07T07:16:20.862-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40279116/Music_and_the_cline_of_Malayness_sounds_of_egalitarianism_and_ranking?f_ri=1159480", "dom_id": "work_40279116", "summary": "The cline of Malayness as exhibited in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula extends through tribal-Malay, rakyat-Malay, aristocrat-Malay and modern urban-Malay.

"Nh\u1ea1c T\u00e0i t\u1eed is a genre of traditional music that emerged in Southern Vietnam during the nineteenth century. The first T\u00e0i t\u1eed performance in the West was part of the theatrical production \"La Bague Enchant\u00e9e\" (The Magic Ring) at the 1900 Paris World Exposition, where Vietnamese musicians accompanied European dancers who were led by the famous French ballerina Cl\u00e9o de M\u00e9rode. The musicologist Julien Tiersot attended this performance and met the leader of the Vietnamese musicians who helped Tiersot notate \u201cthe fundamental repertoire of (T\u00e0i t\u1eed) music performed at the Exposition\u201d which was later published as \"Danse de l\u2019Indo-chine\" (Dance of Indochina).  To date, this 110 years old notation is the first published Western music score of Nh\u1ea1c T\u00e0i t\u1eed.\nThis paper will discuss the historical contexts which led to the collaboration between European dancers and Vietnamese musicians.  Analysis of the score will reveal traces of T\u00e0i t\u1eed music that are still currently performed in Vietnam.  A discussion, accompanied by live demonstrations on traditional Vietnamese music instruments, will illustrate theoretical principles of the T\u00e0i t\u1eed modes, ornamentations and expressive techniques which were not included in the score.  A comparative study will highlight similarities between the musical materials found in Tiersot\u2019s notation and the T\u00e0i t\u1eed classic Ancient Repertoire. Based on new findings, this paper will also explore the hypothesis that \"Danse de l\u2019Indo-chine\" reflects the performance order of T\u00e0i t\u1eed musical items in the theatrical production \"La Bague Enchant\u00e9e\".  This ordering of musical materials may well have been chosen to support the dramatic storyline of the production.\n\nPresenters: Le-Tuyen Nguyen (Australian National University) and \nHuynh Khai (Ho

emphasis on uan, a wordless vocalization based upon specific vowels and consonants, using spectrographic images. Spectrographs are computer images that visualize the fundamental, overtones, and noise-like sounds of a performance. Uan can be reduced to five basic sounds and are analyzed individually and then placed within a musical context. Performances from different generations and musical lineages are contrasted and compared in relation to timbre. I argue it is the relative timbral consistency of the five basic uan sounds, connecting musical generations and lineages, combined with the unique characteristics of each performance that defines the distinct sound of Thai classical singing.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55618573, "asset_id": 35538257, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51995625, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Latartara", "domain_name": "olemiss", "page_name": "JohnLatartara", "display_name": "John Latartara", "profile_url": "https://olemiss.academia.edu/JohnLatartara?f_ri=1159480", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51995625/18843921/18803840/s65_john.latartara.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 36638, "name": "Thai", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 139928, "name": "Asian music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_music?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 151048, "name": "Spectrogram", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spectrogram?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 441931, "name": "Spectrograph", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spectrograph?f_ri=1159480"}, {"id": 546478, "name": "Thai music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_music?f_ri=1159480"}, {"id": 1159480, "name": "Southeast Asian Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Music?f_ri=1159480"}, {"id": 1661384, "name": "Uan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Uan?f_ri=1159480"}, {"id": 2856624, "name": "thai classical singing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/thai_classical_singing?f_ri=1159480"}, {"id": 2883150, "name": "thai classical music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/thai_classical_music?f_ri=1159480"}]}, {"id": 28473635, "title": "Beyond Tradition", "created_at": "2016-09-14T02:03:20.087-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28473635/Beyond_Tradition?f_ri=1159480", "dom_id": "work_28473635", "summary": "A documentary film of the Gala Concert of the World Festival of Vietnamese Traditional Music, Sydney 2015.

Thailand's popular media (television, film and newspapers) regularly present the romantic image of Suraphon as an individual artistic genius killed in his prime. However, his recording and business history has received little scholarly attention. This article describes Suraphon's use of the 78 rpm record format and his exploitation of the emerging lukthung audience in order to contribute to a fuller understanding of the Thai popular music industry during the 1950s and 1960s. Through the skilful manipulation and management of audience tastes, band personnel and content provision, Suraphon became the first Thai artist to bring song writing, performance, recording process, management and promotion completely under his own control.

Growing up during the early-to-mid twentieth century, children of performing arts families would spend their time at wayang and gamelan performances; they rarely attended formal education past primary school and were immersed in gamelan music nearly every night. Performing as part of a large extended family they were expected to quickly pick up the instruments of the gamelan from exposure and absorption alone.  \nThe advent of compulsory schooling, along with the high value placed on education by many Javanese, has fundamentally altered how children spend their time; they can no longer stay up all night at a wayang performance before school. State-sponsored specialist arts institutions have become the sole route to a successful career as a musician. All aspiring professional gamelan musicians attend these schools, which have been accused of promoting institutionalised musical styles rather than teaching material as it would be played in performance.\nThe smaller family size common nowadays, with a tendency to move out of the family home and live as a separate nuclear family, means that large family performances are less feasible. Such family changes have affected the performance culture. In a region where performances are usually funded by the host, a smaller family is less likely to sponsor a large-scale performance with a whole gamelan troupe. This means that performances are less frequent, and has made learning through performing more difficult.\nBased on original fieldwork, this paper examines how changes in schooling, the family and the performance culture have affected knowledge transmission of gamelan music in Java, and shows that despite such drastic change, many children of performing arts families continue to become musicians, finding ways to combine knowledge gained from school with that from their own families.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45591930, "asset_id": 25290913, "asset_type": "Work",

He was also a key member of the team that carried out the first comprehensive survey of Taiwanese music in 1943. In the past, his 1939 fieldwork in Southeast Asia has been long neglected except for the publication of his field diary compiled by Umeda in 1997. Although his work on Taiwanese indigenous music has been regarded as a canon on the subject, no study has examined how his fieldwork in Southeast Asia informed and influenced his study of Taiwanese indigenous music. After combing through Kurosawa\u2019s canonic book on Taiwanese indigenous music published in 1973, I found that the book made many references to Southeast Asian music. Furthermore, I discovered that most of these references were based on the information and materials that Kurosawa collected in his 1939 fieldwork in Southeast Asia and afterwards. Most importantly I found that one of Kurosawa\u2019s main points in his 1973 book is to suggest that Taiwanese indigenous music originated from the music of Southeast Asia but went through changes afterwards. Using Kurosawa\u2019s 1973 book and his archival materials now preserved at the National Taiwan University Library as my primary data, I provide preliminary observations on how Kurosawa\u2019s 1939 fieldwork in Southeast Asia informed and influenced his subsequent study of Taiwanese indigenous music. By doing so, I hope to fill the above-mentioned gaps by bringing attention to Kurosawa\u2019s 1939 fieldwork in Southeast Asia and its importance to his life-long devotion to organology and to his study of Taiwanese indigenous music.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 900408, "first_name": "Ying-fen", "last_name": "Wang \u738b\u6afb\u82ac", "domain_name": "taiwan", "page_name": "YingfenWang", "display_name": "Ying-fen  Wang \u738b\u6afb\u82ac", "profile_url": "https://taiwan.academia.edu/YingfenWang?f_ri=1159480", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/900408/331353/3325725/s65_ying-fen.wang.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4843, "name": "Organology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organology?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5037, "name": "Historical Ethnomusicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Ethnomusicology?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15658, "name": "History of Taiwan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Taiwan?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19495, "name": "Indigenous Peoples", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Peoples?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24365, "name": "History of Musicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Musicology?f_ri=1159480"}, {"id": 376403, "name": "Austronesian Nusantarean", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_Nusantarean?f_ri=1159480"}, {"id": 1159480, "name": "Southeast Asian Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Music?f_ri=1159480"}, {"id": 1314340, "name": "Colonial Taiwan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Taiwan?f_ri=1159480"}]}, {"id": 57828214, "title": "Beyond Rhythm: Exploring Infinite Possibilities in Music, Movement and Choreography\u2013Hands Percussion Malaysia", "created_at": "2021-10-14T07:56:26.275-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/57828214/Beyond_Rhythm_Exploring_Infinite_Possibilities_in_Music_Movement_and_Choreography_Hands_Percussion_Malaysia?f_ri=1159480", "dom_id": "work_57828214", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 72536991, "asset_id": 57828214, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49825375, "first_name": "Clare", "last_name": "Chan", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ClareChan", "display_name": "Clare Chan", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ClareChan?f_ri=1159480", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/49825375/19138029/19086078/s65_clare.chan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 81991, "name": "Interculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interculturalism?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1159480, "name": "Southeast Asian Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Music?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1378307, "name": "Sustainability In Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainability_In_Music?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1378308, "name": "Asia Pacific Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asia_Pacific_Music?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37682682, "title": "The Demise of the Gurukula system in Asia and the Condition of Music Tradition in the Post-Industrial Era", "created_at": "2018-10-31T16:41:02.829-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37682682/The_Demise_of_the_Gurukula_system_in_Asia_and_the_Condition_of_Music_Tradition_in_the_Post_Industrial_Era?f_ri=1159480", "dom_id": "work_37682682", "summary": "Rapid developments in media and communications technology have affected the manner in which we carry out our research.

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and theoretical perspectives on musical communities (Finnegan 1989, Cohen 1991), this paper explores the distinctive ways in which these musicians negotiated their unique social and musical positions. Socially, I situate the community as at once liminal and unconventional yet firmly rooted in its place and local identity, drawing selectively on elements of the monolithic \u2018Javanese culture\u2019. Musically, I show how the community blurred boundaries between genres assumed to have distinct \u2018scenes\u2019, and between popular and traditional musics, forming a point of connection between state-endorsed versions of Indonesian culture and global youth subcultures. Together, these factors enabled the community to create its unique scene, connected to a variety of local and international musical \u2018worlds\u2019.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28400601, "first_name": "Jenny", "last_name": "McCallum", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "JennyMcCallum", "display_name": "Jenny McCallum", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/JennyMcCallum?f_ri=1159480", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28400601/10515394/11733932/s65_jenny.mccallum.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30437, "name": "Indonesian Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Music?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 243982, "name": "Javanese studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Javanese_studies?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 895012, "name": "Indonesian Popular Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Popular_Music?f_ri=1159480", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1159480, "name": "Southeast Asian Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Music?f_ri=1159480"}]}]
