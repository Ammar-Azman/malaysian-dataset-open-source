"work_34811407", "summary": "This qualitative study was undertaken against the backdrop of rapidly increasing levels of immigration to Ireland and a subsequent growing increase in the percentage of children attending Irish primary schools with a first language other than English or Irish, the two official languages of the country. The research investigates the attitudes of a group of first generation minority language children, of various ethnic backgrounds, to home language maintenance and development as well as their experiences of home language use both in school and in the family home. Data were collected from 17 minority language children, aged between 10 and 13 years and living in Ireland for a period of between three and seven years. Data collection methods included focus group interviews and semi-structured individual interviews, during which participants expressed beliefs, opinions and attitudes surrounding language practices. Interviews conducted with four parents of the child participants provided additional data. In addition, an interview with the teacher of a complementary language school for Polish children highlighted the efforts made by the Polish community; the largest non-Irish group in Ireland, to promote home language maintenance in the family. The data show that while the majority of children and parents display positive attitudes to home language maintenance and development, children face challenges in continuing to develop the literacy skills in the home language. The importance of maintaining and continuing to develop the home language for continued communication with extended family members is clear. The need for familial support in relation to the opportunities children have to engage in home language learning is evident. The perceptions of English as a global language and as a valuable asset were evident among both children and parents. There is no provision made for the formal learning of home languages to children in Ireland, and the only opportunity for children to do so is limited to privately run complementary schools, which are not always accessible to all nationalities. Concerns of children and parents regarding continued development in the home language are voiced, and in most cases, these concerns are borne out of a possible return to their native countries.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54670462, "asset_id": 34811407, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25684105, "first_name": "Lorraine", "last_name": "Connaughton-Crean", "domain_name": "dcu", "page_name": "LorraineConnaughtonCrean", "display_name": "Lorraine Connaughton-Crean", "profile_url": "https://dcu.academia.edu/LorraineConnaughtonCrean?f_ri=406410", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/25684105/11851566/13208556/s65_lorraine.connaughton.jpg"}, {"id": 29548197, "first_name": "P\u00e1draig", "last_name": "\u00d3 Duibhir", "domain_name": "dcu", "page_name": "PadraigODuibhir", "display_name": "P\u00e1draig  \u00d3 Duibhir", "profile_url": "https://dcu.academia.edu/PadraigODuibhir?f_ri=406410", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/29548197/10285290/11477850/s65_p_draig.duibhir.jpg_oh_76b1d3e8c688ab630aa5b96f24658cd6_oe_56993bbd"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 406410, "name": "Educational Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Language_Policy?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1542348, "name": "Home Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Language?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 15587866, "title": "Student Support Services and Campus Diversity: Pacific Islander Students and the University of Hawai\u2019i at Hilo", "created_at": "2015-09-10T17:01:27.825-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15587866/Student_Support_Services_and_Campus_Diversity_Pacific_Islander_Students_and_the_University_of_Hawai_i_at_Hilo?f_ri=406410", "dom_id": "work_15587866", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38731143, "asset_id": 15587866, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 38731025, "asset_id": 15587866, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34753792, "first_name": "Cheiron", "last_name": "McMahill", "domain_name": "southcentral", "page_name": "CheironMcMahill", "display_name": "Cheiron McMahill", "profile_url": "https://southcentral.academia.edu/CheironMcMahill?f_ri=406410", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/34753792/10138505/11312707/s65_cheiron.mcmahill.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5539, "name": "Language and Ideology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Ideology?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18640, "name": "Ideology and Discourse Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ideology_and_Discourse_Analysis?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52580, "name": "Minority language rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_language_rights?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 122894, "name": "Teacher Education in Teaching English to Speakers of Second/Foreign Languages (TESOL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_Education_in_Teaching_English_to_Speakers_of_Second_Foreign_Languages_TESOL_?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 131845, "name": "Early Childhood Education and Development, English second language development, Children's Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Childhood_Education_and_Development_English_second_language_development_Childrens_Rights?f_ri=406410"}, {"id": 156299, "name": "Reflective Teaching, Teacher Education, Critical Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reflective_Teaching_Teacher_Education_Critical_Pedagogy?f_ri=406410"}, {"id": 208709, "name": "Languages Rights of National Minorities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_Rights_of_National_Minorities?f_ri=406410"}, {"id": 406410, "name": "Educational Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Language_Policy?f_ri=406410"}, {"id": 1032366, "name": "Indigenous and Minority Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_and_Minority_Languages?f_ri=406410"}]}, {"id": 5960398, "title": "(2013).

The ethnographic material presented is based on the author\u2019s ten years living and working among bilingual urban Malays, and a year making regular visits to rural communities in Narathiwat. One of the few things that informed analysts of South Thailand agree on is that a range of factors contributed to the resumption of violence in 2004. In addition to the role of political legitimacy, there is consensus that progress towards peace is complicated by the involvement of uncivil constituencies from two highly ethnicised religious communities. Despite the importance of ethnoreligious issues this paper argues that ethnolinguistic dynamics\u23afspecifically language loyalty, loss, and angst\u23afhave much to contribute to the return of peaceful co-existence and reconciliation. Although religious freedom in Thailand is promised and present, few minority languages in Thailand are strong now than they were before policies promulgated in the 1930s. I introduce the range of positions on the role of language and multi-lingualism in the construction of difference and the achievement of peaceful co-existence. I describe the range mono-lingual and bilingual communities in South Thailand. I also recount the variety of ways that Southern Malays have responded to the decline of Malay and the importance of Thai for those wishing to engage in Thai modernity. There is a need to as informed by ethno-linguistic angst as ethno-religious rebellion.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32924081, "asset_id": 5960398, "asset_type": "Work",

Findings suggest that though all students are considered language learners, educational reform policies and practices may be undermining the school's effort to implement an equitable bilingual program.

With recent legal and political victories, the Ainu have begun to reclaim their Indigenous culture and language within local communities, on the wider national stage, and internationally. However, while Ainu revitalization efforts continue, discourses of globalization in Japan have contributed to a dramatic increase in the status of English-as-a-foreign-language education, eclipsing other foreign and minority languages at all levels. Examining current policies, both\u00a0de jure\u00a0and\u00a0de facto\u00a0(see, e.g., Johnson, 2013; Schiffman, 1996), this paper explores how the disproportionate focus on English in contemporary Japanese education, reflected in societal and policy discourses regarding language and globalization, may be contributing to the closing down of ideological and implementational spaces (Hornberger, 2002, 2005, 2006; Hornberger & Johnson, 2007) for Ainu language education, thereby negatively impacting the continued revitalization of the Ainu language. The paper concludes by implicating opposing discursive orientations to globalization within Japanese society, and Japanese educational language policy specifically, in the lack of explicit attention to Ainu language revitalization efforts in national policy, and suggests that more critical examination of the role of English in Japanese education is needed if these efforts are to continue to succeed.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53023209, "asset_id": 32880449, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7879398, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Hanks", "domain_name": "upenn", "page_name": "DavidHHanks", "display_name": "David H Hanks", "profile_url": "https://upenn.academia.edu/DavidHHanks?f_ri=406410", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7879398/2780731/30640287/s65_david.hanks.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17158, "name": "Japan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japan?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24413, "name": "Ainu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ainu?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42227, "name": "English as an International Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_as_an_International_Language?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 406410, "name": "Educational Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Language_Policy?f_ri=406410"}]}, {"id": 41755133, "title": "Raising Bilingual and Biliterate Heritage Speakers of Russian in a Monolingual Context: The Impact of Family and Supplementary Education Language Policies", "created_at": "2020-01-27T18:27:58.554-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41755133/Raising_Bilingual_and_Biliterate_Heritage_Speakers_of_Russian_in_a_Monolingual_Context_The_Impact_of_Family_and_Supplementary_Education_Language_Policies?f_ri=406410", "dom_id": "work_41755133", "summary": "The recent interest in heritage language education reflects an attempt to reverse language shift towards the exclusive use of English in immigrant families.

It explores two domains of the children\u2019s life: the contexts of family and a Russian Saturday School by investigating specific language beliefs, practices, and language management strategies at the Russian School and the families of five of its graduates as well as by providing a threefold perspective of parents, teachers and adolescents. Observations, interviews and surveys provide different types of data that helps us understand of how these different contexts impact the adolescents\u2019 language development and their attitude towards their heritage language. \n\tIn line with previous research, this study confirms the leading role of parents in heritage language preservation. The main components of the parents\u2019 language policy that supported bilingualism were (1) dedication to the home language and culture, (2) adherence to strict rules about when each language is used, and (3) support of Russian language development by providing additional opportunities to practice both receptive and reproductive skills in Russian. In the family context, language management was largely implemented through language practices and parental language use was one of the main tactics of such management. \nThe study demonstrates that the Russian School played an important role in the lives of these families not only as a place of supplementary education but also as a community builder where children socialized in the Russian culture in a pressure-free atmosphere. It played an important role in building a positive attitude towards the Russian language in adolescence.\nThe analysis also reveals a diminishing role of parents and teaching in affecting language choices and language practices of children in adolescence. At this stage, their choice to use Russian for personal activities was closely related to the opportunities to use the Russian language outside of the home and the Russian School, especially in communication with their peers.\nThis study has implications for the theory of family language policy, heritage language educators, program planners, and immigrant families interested in raising bilingual-biliterate children. \u2003\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61912726, "asset_id": 41755133, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26938945, "first_name": "Anna", "last_name": "Ice", "domain_name": "ucla", "page_name": "AniaIce", "display_name": "Anna Ice", "profile_url": "https://ucla.academia.edu/AniaIce?f_ri=406410", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26938945/36115778/32477244/s65_anna.ice.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18663, "name": "Supplementary Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Supplementary_Education?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19861, "name": "Russian Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian_Language?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33372, "name": "Heritage language studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_language_studies?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47268, "name": "Bilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingualism?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 96496, "name": "Heritage Language Speakers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Language_Speakers?f_ri=406410"}, {"id": 175616, "name": "Russian Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian_Diaspora?f_ri=406410"}, {"id": 406410, "name": "Educational Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Language_Policy?f_ri=406410"}, {"id": 1008368, "name": "Family Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_Language_Policy?f_ri=406410"}, {"id": 1297595, "name": "Saturday Schools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Saturday_Schools?f_ri=406410"}, {"id": 1737742, "name": "Language and Speech Development in Hearing Impairments", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Speech_Development_in_Hearing_Impairments?f_ri=406410"}]}, {"id": 35119304, "title": "Perception of Morality Affected by the Evolving Social Structures in Ben Jonson's Volpone", "created_at": "2017-11-11T12:17:23.191-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35119304/Perception_of_Morality_Affected_by_the_Evolving_Social_Structures_in_Ben_Jonsons_Volpone?f_ri=406410", "dom_id": "work_35119304", "summary": "Individuals have their own culture and social structure. They are accustomed to the norms and practices of that social structure. But the advent of new elements brings notable changes in their particular social pattern. These changes have impact on individual's personalities, thinking, and behavior; and the society takes a new look with distinguished characteristics. Ben Jonson, in Volpone, presents a group of diverse characters who seemed to be the representatives of the rising period of protocapitalist economic order. These characters are distinguished by what and how fraudulently they speak to others to boost money and wealth. They are in rivalry against each other, and mostly engaged in the acquirement of material goods over goodwill and moral obligation. Among others Volpone and Mosca are the leading representatives who constantly entice the different entrepreneurial potential to avariciously drive for money, and to finally shatter their hopes. The two mastermind plotters creatively shroud their true sort in entwining linguistic artifice merely to trick the wealth-maniac people by making themselves unsuspected and credible. The difference between right and wrong evaporates from society, and the principles and morality have been at stake. Such society depicted in the play gives a new mode of principles, morality, and good conduct. The attitudes to morality have been under consideration in the analysis.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30169788, "first_name": "Muhammad Mushfiqur", "last_name":

It explores two domains of the children\u2019s life: the contexts of family and a Russian Saturday School by investigating specific language beliefs, practices, and language management strategies at the Russian School and the families of five of its graduates as well as by providing a threefold perspective of parents, teachers and adolescents. Observations, interviews and surveys provide different types of data that helps us understand of how these different contexts impact the adolescents\u2019 language development and their attitude towards their heritage language.

The study researches their aspects about the Greek language and education in Pontos area during the modern Greek nationalism period. In the context of Pontos the question of choosing the educational language and reform acquired national dimensions, while at the same time two tendencies were expressed: the first of them constitutes expression of the patriarchic ecumenism and proposes the purist Greek as a tool that will allow the resurgence of ancient Greek spirit and the establishment of the Hellenisms in the East. The second tendency constitutes an expression of the Modern Greek nationalism, being supported by people considering modern Greek language as a renewing force determining the national characteristics of modern Greek nation. Chrysanthos expresses the first tendency, proposing the puristic Greek and following consequently his ideological origins and values. N. Kapetanidis evidently supports the educational vulgarism and castigates all the vulnerable points of an educational system directed in the patriarchal ecumenical values. In the article the relation between the two tendencies is examined while they are included in the frame of Modern Greek nationalism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57711381, "asset_id": 37718528, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 93607215, "first_name": "Sofia", "last_name": "Iliadou-Tachou", "domain_name": "uowm", "page_name": "SIliadouTachou", "display_name": "Sofia Iliadou-Tachou", "profile_url": "https://uowm.academia.edu/SIliadouTachou?f_ri=406410", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/93607215/21301046/20724925/s65_sofia.iliadou-tachou.jpg"}, {"id": 58834023, "first_name": "Pougaridou", "last_name": "Paraskevi", "domain_name": "uowm", "page_name": "PougaridouParaskevi", "display_name": "Pougaridou  Paraskevi", "profile_url": "https://uowm.academia.edu/PougaridouParaskevi?f_ri=406410", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2062, "name": "Greek Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Greek_Language?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2196, "name": "History of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Education?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26448, "name": "Hellenism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hellenism?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42255, "name": "Greek Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Greek_Nationalism?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 406410, "name": "Educational Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Language_Policy?f_ri=406410"}, {"id": 422982, "name": "Pontos", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pontos?f_ri=406410"}, {"id": 488992, "name": "Trabzon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trabzon?f_ri=406410"}, {"id": 3055838, "name": "Metropolitan Chrysanthos", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Metropolitan_Chrysanthos?f_ri=406410"}, {"id": 3055839, "name": "Patriarchic Ecumenism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Patriarchic_Ecumenism?f_ri=406410"}]}, {"id": 14981523, "title": "Shaping language ecology in education: The Estonian case", "created_at": "2015-08-17T06:27:06.922-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14981523/Shaping_language_ecology_in_education_The_Estonian_case?f_ri=406410", "dom_id": "work_14981523", "summary": "The article provides a short overview how the competition between three languages \u2013 Estonian, Russian and English in the Estonian linguistic environment has manifested in education, and has been shaped by language education policy.

I begin by demonstrating how the local rise of Thai/Siamese influence coincided with growth of Islamic reformism. The subjugation of the Malay Kerajaan of Patani by Siamese forces between the 178Os and the 1820\u2019s led to an exodus of \u2018ulama to Mecca at a tumultuous time. The writings and returning students of Malay-Indonesian scholars based in Mecca began to challenge traditionalist orthopraxy in Pattani before Siam increased its attempts to assimilate its southern subjects following the 1909 Anglo-Siamese Treaty. The governments of General Prem Tinsulanonda negotiated an amnesty to Malay separatists, accommodated Malay demands, and co-opted Malay elites. Once more, these developments roughly coincided with Islamic resurgence. As a result, Malays in South Thailand are both more religiously observant, and engagement in Thai modernity. The second half of this paper describes the impact of these Thai and Islamic influences on merit-making rhetoric, rituals, and rationales. Malay language loss among urban Malays have led to increasing numbers referring to the generation, accumulation and transference of merit as tham bun (merit-making)\u23afan expansive Thai religious idiom. While Thai influences have impacted merit-making rhetoric, Islamic reformism has changed merit (Th. Bun, SM. Pahala) are generating. Traditionalists and reformists both insist that the performance of one\u2019s individual ritual obligations (fardu \u2018in) has the biggest effect on Muslim\u2019s comfort in the grave and eschatological vindication. Nevertheless, reformist reject the efficacy of merit transferred to the deceased (except when performed by anak saleh) have led to the circle of posthumous funeral feasts being replaced by merit-transference strategies considered consistent with the sunnah. Traditionalists argue for the efficacy of a range of merit-generating ritual complexes, and that merit-transference is a meritorious act. While Thai influences have impacted merit-making rhetoric, and Islamic influences merit-making rituals, both affect merit-making rationales. Islamic tradition emphatically affirms that one\u2019s the level of one\u2019s store of merit affects one\u2019s comfort in the grave and vindication at judgment. While Malays of South Thailand share the Indic background with other Southeast Asian Muslims, contact with Theravada Buddhism can be seen to have led to a greater emphasis on, and more sophisticated conception of, the economy of merit in South Thailand.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 29561199, "asset_id": 2042640, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

Most Indonesians today speak a number of languages as a matter of course, the vast majority using a regional language other than Bahasa Indonesia in the home and/or community (e.g., Javanese) and studying a foreign language (usually English). For many Indonesians Bahasa Indonesia is as much a second language as the foreign languages studied in school-children often speak little to no Bahasa Indonesia prior to formal education where it is the official medium of instruction. However, its ubiquity in the public sphere and national significance as a symbol of unity tends to elevate its status far beyond that of other languages any individual might also be said to be a speaker of, even their first/home language(s). Following the dialogic approach of Wortham (2001), this paper employs narrative inquiry to examine how metadiscursive regimes (Bauman & Briggs, 2003; see also Makoni & Pennycook, 2007)-normative ideological frameworks for talking about language and language users-identifiable in participant self-narrative, educational language policy documents, and language education materials work to (re)produce idealized multi-languaged subjects (Flores, 2017). From this examination, the argument is made that educational language policy and planning in Indonesia has played a key role in shaping a very narrowly defined ideal multilingual Indonesian, one who is first and foremost a speaker of Bahasa Indonesia and only secondarily a speaker of others, each with their own delineated domains of use.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7879398, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Hanks", "domain_name": "upenn", "page_name": "DavidHHanks", "display_name": "David H Hanks", "profile_url": "https://upenn.academia.edu/DavidHHanks?f_ri=406410", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7879398/2780731/30640287/s65_david.hanks.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 34149, "name": "Narrative Inquiry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative_Inquiry?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 406410, "name": "Educational Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Language_Policy?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1831626, "name": "Language Governmentality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Governmentality?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 26868068, "title": "Approaching micro-level planning from an intelligibility perspective: A case study from Pentecost Island, Vanuatu 1", "created_at": "2016-07-10T00:35:24.043-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26868068/Approaching_micro_level_planning_from_an_intelligibility_perspective_A_case_study_from_Pentecost_Island_Vanuatu_1?f_ri=406410", "dom_id": "work_26868068", "summary": "The Vanuatu government has recently implemented a policy of vernacular literacy. Children are now to receive the first three years of schooling in a vernacular language. Needless to say, in a country with less than 300,000 people (Vanuatu National Statistics Office 2016) and more than 100 indigenous languages, some classrooms have more than one L1. In such cases, the language policy recommends that the variety with the most native speakers should be promoted. This is a good solution for those speakers of the larger language, but what impact does such a policy have on the children whose L1 is not included in the curriculum, and who are instructed in a vernacular language that is not their own? To answer this question, we conducted intelligibility tests across closely related varieties of northern and central Vanuatu. We conclude that in villages where children already receive a good deal of exposure to other language varieties in their daily lives, implementation of the government's language policy is a viable option. However, we make this point with the caveat that what is practical and beneficial for literacy education is not necessarily optimal for the preservation of small endangered language varieties.

"summary": "As one of the most significant aspects of the Balinese economy, tourism attracts a large number of foreign nationals to the Indonesian island province. For a variety of reasons many tourists choose to study the national language (Bahasa Indonesia) to at least some degree during their stay. In order to meet this demand, a few small private language schools have been established, having developed their own specialized teaching materials in the process. In this paper supplemental workbook materials published by one such school in Bali are examined through the methodological lens of narrative analysis following the dialogic approach of Wortham (2001). The ways in which statements about language use and language users in these materials interactionally position both students and those with whom they are expected to come into contact during their time in Bali are explored. In conjunction with narrative data collected from participant interviews with school administrators and students, this analysis demonstrates how implicit language policies (see, e.g., Johnson, 2013) communicated by such teaching materials can be seen to work to produce particular dynamically languaged subject formations (Flores, 2017) for local Balinese, Indonesians more generally, and tourists (as well as other non-nationals) embedded within a socioeconomic framework of neoliberal governmentality (Foucault, 2007). Extending this observation, the argument is made that in the context of Balinese society the uncritical inclusion of such implicit language policies in these kinds of materials not only socializes newcomers into understanding that specific language practices are important for navigating racialized divisions of labor, but also has the potential to reproduce and exacerbate socioeconomic disparities and orientalist relations of power between local Indonesians/Balinese and (predominantly) Western tourists. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications for the development of language teaching materials in the Balinese context as well as language teaching materials more generally.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7879398, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Hanks", "domain_name": "upenn", "page_name": "DavidHHanks", "display_name": "David H Hanks", "profile_url": "https://upenn.academia.edu/DavidHHanks?f_ri=406410", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7879398/2780731/30640287/s65_david.hanks.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 34149, "name": "Narrative Inquiry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative_Inquiry?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43883, "name": "Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 406410, "name": "Educational Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Language_Policy?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 994693, "name": "Neoliberalism & Governmentality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neoliberalism_and_Governmentality?f_ri=406410", "nofollow": false}]}]
