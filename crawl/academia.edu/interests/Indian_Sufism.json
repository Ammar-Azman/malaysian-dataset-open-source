The study is based on a qualitative analysis of interviews and participant observation with Sufi practitioners in the Kashmir valley. The Thematic analysis revealed several themes, including the importance of spiritual connection, the gendered nature of spiritual kinship, and its relationship with power dynamics within Sufi communities. The results suggest that spiritual kinship plays a vital role in personal transformation and the development of social cohesion within Sufi communities. However, the gendered nature of spiritual kinship and its intersection with power dynamics can also create challenges and tensions. Overall, this study highlights the importance of further exploration of spiritual kinship within Sufi communities and its potential for promoting personal growth and social cohesion.

It further tackles his philosophy in his very well-known book al-Tawheed al-A\u2019zam (The Supreme Union) which forms the basic ground of his Sufi path (Tariqa). The question of how Ibn Alwan is unique from other Sufi scholars in terms of his literary contributions investigated.

There is always a\nneed to study historical phenomena on a contemporary basis as there is always a change\nfollowing the institutions of society. Hence the study of Sufi cults in the contemporary era\nprovides us with the change and development in institutions from earlier eras. The emergence\nof Saifis in Lahore was a recent phenomenon. Its founder Pir Saif-ur-Rehman (1928-2010)\nmigrated to Lahore in the midst of Soviet Afghan War (1979-1989). Therefore, one can trace the\nemergence of Saifis within the last three decades. Besides tracing the history of Saifi order, this\nstudy examines their contribution in Sufism, the belief system of Saifis, the religious practices of\nthe Order and affinity of its followers with other contemporary orders such as, Suherwardi,\nChishti, and Qadri. This study is not based upon the perspective of comparative religious study,\nrather it is based on the historical narrative of Saifia, a new off-shoot of naqshbandi order.\nMoreover, this research is based upon the local narrative of people and followers of silsila saifia\nabout mysticism and Sufism. It has provided the biographical sketch of founder of the order\nHazrat Pir Saif-ur-rehman Akhunzada and his teachings. It looks at the beliefs, customs, rituals\nand practices of Saifis.

Yet, as much as mysticism is ineffable as much as the published research is full of tangled definitions that only scholars can comprehend. The traditional approach to the study of Sufism makes the topic burdensome and mentally unattainable to the learned public. This article explains Sufism without using complex terminology or intense presentations of mystical states and stations. It is a scholarly attempt that is ultimately designed to provide a straightforward definition of Sufism.

He prepared his dictionary to explain a great number of lofty expressions, wordplays, idioms, and argot seen in contemporary Persian poetry. He thereby meant to give the Ottoman readers some clues as to the complexity of Persian literary works, especially those found in the Sabk-i Hind\u012b (Indian Style) poetry. In order to grasp the Ottoman attitude towards Persian poetry, and thus their mindset, this study will discuss the dictionary\u2019s impact on a group of Ottoman poets with whom Riy\u0101\u017c\u012b had some ties to. To further enrich our understanding of this topic, traces of these relationships will be followed by examining the reading culture of this period, literary works of the poets concerned, their correspondence, and anonymous mecm\u016b\u02bfas (miscellanies).

Therefore, the architect was expected to imitate the act of creation, following the laws and patterns present in nature, to create buildings that not only provide comfort but also stand in harmony with nature. This act of design and construction used to follow 2 levels: form and matterreferring to material and spiritual sides of every building. Traditional master builders, following this concept, were not only equipped with practical knowledge of building, but also the science of geomancy, astrology and the human system, that used to lead to creation of places which promoted health. Studying traditional Persian houses, such as houses of Kashan, which are believed to be the finest examples of traditional Persian architecture, the author believes spiritual aspects of architecture, besides the material aspects, are the reason behind their success in creating health-giving buildings that remain masterpieces, many centuries after their creation. In this research an attempt was made by the author, derived from the case studies, to identify these elements and introduce them as the spiritual side of architectural design. Using this pattern, the important elements of design and architecture can be identified and used by modern architects to create places that are considered health-giving, comfortable and pro-life.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 94933429, "asset_id": 91730062, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 239634414, "first_name": "Hengameh", "last_name": "Fazeli", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "FazeliHengameh", "display_name": "Hengameh Fazeli", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/FazeliHengameh?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/239634414/101620046/90778483/s65_hengameh.fazeli.jpg"}, {"id": 248975176, "first_name": "Esmaeil", "last_name": "Negarestan", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "EsmaeilNegarestan", "display_name": "Esmaeil Negarestan", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/EsmaeilNegarestan?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/248975176/102883960/92054449/s65_esmaeil.negarestan.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1372, "name": "Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7654, "name": "Vernacular Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vernacular_Architecture?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 417245, "name": "Spirituality & Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spirituality_and_Architecture?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 91695710, "title": "The Salience of Saintliness in Islam: A Sufi Perspective", "created_at": "2022-11-27T04:44:39.147-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/91695710/The_Salience_of_Saintliness_in_Islam_A_Sufi_Perspective?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_91695710", "summary": "While materialism largely failed in achieving humanity\u2019s essential goal of attaining happiness in life, as it intensified people\u2019s attachment to the material world, spirituality represents an alternative way towards accomplishing ultimate joy.

This essay aims to introduce the writings of this enigmatic person. Najm Hosain Syed was born in 1936 in an influential Qadri family of Batala in East Punjab. The Syeds moved to Lahore after the partition where young Najm was educated. In 1958, he completed his Masters in English at Forman Christian College. He joined the Pakistan civil services building a distinguished career from which he retired in 1995. In the years that followed Partition, Punjabi was relegated to a position of relative insignificance in West Punjab. With the exception of Trinjhanh (Girls' Gathering) by Ahmad Rahi in 1953, Punjabi literature did not see any major work. In the 1960s, however, a kind of renaissance of Punjabi language and literature began to develop. Faqir Mohammad Faqir (d. 1974) and Mohammad Baqir (d. 1992) established the Punjabi Academy and began to publish classical Punjabi literature. Najm Hosain Syed started writing early and his first book was published in 1965. Around this time, he also founded Majlis Shah Hussain and Punjabi Adabi Sangat and firmly established them with the support of writers and activists such as Asif Khan (d. 2000) and Shafqat Tanveer Mirza (b.1932). Let us begin our discussion with his poetry. Qafian, his first book of poetry was published in May 1965. The opening poem in this collection is entitled 'A Ghazal.' It describes the rise of a typical day with sparrows chirping but soon turns into something very different. Syed invokes Varis Shah: Seh vunjhe Jhanan da ant nahin (The unfathomable Chenab has no end, Verse 48) to acknowledge that the old world is ending, and it's time to move on. Another poem entitled 'A Qafi' is about the choice of clothes.

We tried to collect data from secondary sources and found that various superstitions entered Sufism when many non-Islamic issues permeated Islam. Imam Rabbani has made tireless efforts in writings and discourses through Sufism to return Islam to its original purity. He was awarded the title of \u201cReformer of the second millennium\u201d because he first introduced Islamic thought in the history of the Indian subcontinent. On the other hand, Imam Rabbani taught the Wa\u1e25dat al-Shuh\u016bd doctrine by criticizing the Wa\u1e25dat al-Wuj\u016bd doctrine introduced by Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b.

This article explores hijra identity in Pakistan by focusing on the creative appropriation of Sufi discourses, practices and organisational forms by hijras to construct a spiritual gender identity for themselves. The political significance of this Sufi-informed identity can be located at two different levels. One is the level of the self. I argue in this article that engagement with Sufi concepts, such as faqiri and mast, is central to the construction of a dignified and powerful image of the hijra self that challenges the marginalised status assigned to hijras. The second level of analysis is concerned with the hijra community\u2019s connection with Sufi networks.

It is also hypothesised that Banw\u0101l\u012bd\u0101s may have used a Braj Bh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 version of the same text-by the poet Nandd\u0101s entitled Prabodhacandrodaya N\u0101\u1e6daka (c. 1570)-, as intermediary with the original Sanskrit. Regardless of the source that our author used to realise his Gulz\u0101r-i \u1e25\u0101l, the filter used to adapt Advaitic elements to the Islamic mystical context was the Wa\u1e25dat al-Wuj\u016bd (\"Unity of Being\"), or the tradition of mysticism that was heavily inspiring Sufi traditions of South Asia at that time. Moreover, a codicological analysis of the Gulz\u0101r-i \u1e25\u0101l's manuscript tradition has brought to light that both Hindu and Muslim readership received the text. In this paper, I will show that the interpretative engagement of Banw\u0101l\u012bd\u0101s carried on a tradition of philosophical studies that did not consider Sufi and Ved\u0101ntic metaphysics as separated entities but as elements that-in dialogue with each other-searched for a common answer to the ultimate truth.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 91563002, "asset_id": 87320929, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 253582, "first_name": "Giuseppe", "last_name": "Cappello", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "GiuseppeCappello1", "display_name": "Giuseppe Cappello", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/GiuseppeCappello1?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/253582/54223/49948/s65_giuseppe.cappello.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1186, "name": "Translation Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25218, "name": "Advaita Vedanta", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Advaita_Vedanta?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 233608, "name": "Indo-Persian Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indo-Persian_Cultural_History?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392166, "name": "Wahdat al-Wujud", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wahdat_al-Wujud?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 595879, "name": "Dara Shukoh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dara_Shukoh?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 87076665, "title": "5 Transporting Knowledge in the Durrani Empire", "created_at": "2022-09-22T04:58:51.450-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/87076665/5_Transporting_Knowledge_in_the_Durrani_Empire?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_87076665", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 91389729, "asset_id": 87076665, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 52836576, "first_name": "Waleed", "last_name": "Ziad", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "WaleedZiad", "display_name": "Waleed Ziad", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/WaleedZiad?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/52836576/22392606/21601202/s65_waleed.ziad.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 87023854, "title": "Dogmas and Doctrines of the Roshnites and the Dispute of Pantheism", "created_at": "2022-09-21T08:39:23.545-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/87023854/Dogmas_and_Doctrines_of_the_Roshnites_and_the_Dispute_of_Pantheism?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_87023854", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 91349916, "asset_id": 87023854, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 161009911, "first_name": "zahid", "last_name": "shah", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "zahidshah38", "display_name": "zahid shah", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/zahidshah38?f_ri=17239", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 803, "name": "Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 86761933, "title": "From Konya to Nusantara: Rumi\u2019s Sufi Diaspora in Pidie, Aceh, Indonesia", "created_at": "2022-09-16T12:43:40.342-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/86761933/From_Konya_to_Nusantara_Rumi_s_Sufi_Diaspora_in_Pidie_Aceh_Indonesia?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_86761933", "summary": "Rumi\u2019s Sufism has not only flourished in Turkey, where the sufi was born, but also in many other far-flung world regions such as Nusantara.\u00a0 Its worldwide success invites many questions, for example, the reasons for its ability to attract both Muslims and non-Muslims.

Shah Baha-ud-Din Naqshband added three more principles which were being recognized \u201cPrinciples of Naqshbandi Sufi Order\u201d. This research paper was designed to explore the effectiveness of these three of its eleven basic principles: Temporal pause (\u0648\u0642\u0648\u0641 \u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0649), Numerical pause (\u0648\u0642\u0648\u0641 \u0639\u062f\u062f\u0649), and Heart pause (\u0648\u0642\u0648\u0641 \u0642\u0644\u0628\u0649).

The universal principles of Islam were vernacularized in specific time and space, and contextualized or localized forms and expressions of Muslim piety emerged in these regions. The credit of vernacularization of Islam and Sufism in South Asia particularly goes to the sufis who challenged the Arabo-Persian linguistic hegemony by producing religious literature in vernacular languages and dialects, as a vast majority of the sufis depended less on Arabic and Persian for the popularization of the sufi message. They employed the medium of vernacular poetry to disseminate the message of Sufism among the common people. They contributed to the development of various scripts as well as new or existing literary genres such as siharfis, kafis, Prem-kahani or \u201eSufi Romances,\u201f and ginans, in order to popularize the teachings of Sufism in S...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 88088875, "asset_id": 82349499, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 73824908, "first_name": "Tanvir", "last_name": "Anjum", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "TanvirAnjum5", "display_name": "Tanvir Anjum", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/TanvirAnjum5?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/73824908/89838812/78560158/s65_tanvir.anjum.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7361, "name": "Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 38841, "name": "Vernacular", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vernacular?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 1834642, "name": "Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 81949545, "title": "Typology of Anecdotes During 8th to 10th Century AD (Plus Introducing Two Manuscripts", "created_at": "2022-06-20T22:33:05.648-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/81949545/Typology_of_Anecdotes_During_8th_to_10th_Century_AD_Plus_Introducing_Two_Manuscripts?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_81949545", "summary": "Researchers believe Res\u0101la-ye Delgo\u0161\u0101 by Ubaid Zakani as the first literary book specifically dedicated to anecdotes. The second most famous book is Lata\u02bcif al-tava\u02bcif by \u02bbAl\u012b ibn \u1e24usayn K\u0101shif\u012b \u1e62af\u012b who is known as the inventor of classification based on social castes. As literary theorists often emphasize, no literary work is formed suddenly and works of every kind progress gradually under influence of the previous ones. The key question is whether the works by Ubaid Zakani and Ali Safi were sudden and with no support. This paper presents a record of anecdotes books and tries to show missing circles in the process of compilation of such books from the 8th to 10th century AD. We conclude that there were some minor books on anecdotes before Ubaid, which are not available today. We may safely claim that writing essays on anecdotes was a tradition common before Ubaid period and this will not undermine the value of his work. The same tradition continued after Ubaid and authors invented their own style. We can point to Majma al-Latayef and Majma-al-Navader as examples of two books on anecdotes compiled before Lata\u02bcif al-tava\u02bcif by \u02bbAl\u012b ibn \u1e24usayn K\u0101shif\u012b \u1e62af\u012b.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 87814958, "asset_id": 81949545, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 188647591, "first_name": "Journal of", "last_name": "Literary Text Research", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "zabanoadabzabanoadab", "display_name": "Journal of Literary Text Research", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/zabanoadabzabanoadab?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/188647591/52294793/40399822/s65_zabanoadab.zabanoadab.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2418, "name": "Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44293, "name": "Literature Review", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature_Review?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 81946044, "title": "Comparative Study between Baha' al-Din Naqshband Bukhari's Two Books of Anis at-Talibin and Maqamat", "created_at": "2022-06-20T21:13:19.350-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/81946044/Comparative_Study_between_Baha_al_Din_Naqshband_Bukharis_Two_Books_of_Anis_at_Talibin_and_Maqamat?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_81946044", "summary": "These two books Anisatolibin and Maqamat-e-Naqshband are among the oldest and most important sources about Baha' al-Din Naqshband (718-791) and his principles.

Tablighi Jamaat is known as the institutional da'wah activities introduced by Maulana Ilyas, considering the demands of the modern Muslim mind and society. Tablighi Jamaat's primary purposes are to spread the message of Islam among the people and self-purification through religious practice. At the same time, this movement works for the spiritual restructuring of Islam at the grass-root level of society. The people of this Jamaat have been urging Muslims worldwide to focus on the core religious practices in pursuit of self-development and socio-Islamic reform. On the other hand, their lack of interest in traditional politics also accelerates people's religious fervour; this is considered another big reason for their popularity. In recent times, the activities of Tablighi Jamaat have expanded considerably in the Indian subcontinent and beyond. Through the efforts of the Tablighi people, a great awakening has taken place among the Muslim masses. Moreover, the people's interest in embodying Islam through practice and da'wah has increased anew.

Sufism is noted as an arena of spiritual/religious practice that highlights musical routes to the Divine. Among Chishti Sufis of South Asia, that musical pathway is qawwali, a song form that been in circulation for over seven centuries, and which continues to maintain a vibrant sonic presence on the subcontinent, both in its ritual usage among Sufis and more broadly in related folk and popular iterations. This paper asks, what happens to qawwali as a song form when it circulates in diaspora? While prominent musicians such as the Sabri Brothers and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan exposed audiences in the West to the sounds of qawwali, in recent years, non-hereditary groups of musicians based in the US and UK have begun to perform songs from the qawwali repertoire.

This research found that contemporary Sufism is no longer oriented exclusively toward the pursuit of spiritual achievements, but it also becomes an instrument of political and economic interests.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81837778, "asset_id": 73239473, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 148395383, "first_name": "Jurnal", "last_name": "Teosofi", "domain_name": "uinsby", "page_name": "JurnalTeosofi", "display_name": "Jurnal Teosofi", "profile_url": "https://uinsby.academia.edu/JurnalTeosofi?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/148395383/40879174/36880245/s65_jurnal.teosofi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14584, "name": "Persianate Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persianate_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17240, "name": "Contemporary Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24788, "name": "Sufism in the West", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_in_the_West?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 28459, "name": "Tariqa Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tariqa_Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 35080, "name": "Sufism in the Formative Period", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_in_the_Formative_Period?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 177375, "name": "Cosmopolitan Sufism & Religiosity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Sufism_and_Religiosity?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 193481, "name": "philosophical Sufism (school of Ibn 'Arabi)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/philosophical_Sufism_school_of_Ibn_Arabi_?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 344616, "name": "Early Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 647028, "name": "Sufism and Tasawwuf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_and_Tasawwuf?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 73239139, "title": "On the Renovation of Religious Discourse: Analysis of Concepts, and Internal and External Disciplines", "created_at": "2022-03-07T05:21:11.618-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/73239139/On_the_Renovation_of_Religious_Discourse_Analysis_of_Concepts_and_Internal_and_External_Disciplines?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_73239139", "summary": "This paper aims to clarify the meaning of 'renovation of religious discourse' through an analysis of the concept and some related concepts in general, and more specifically by defining the disciplines of this renovation and their importance in determining its meaning. The paper adopts the thesis that these disciplines play a pivotal role in determining the nature, meaning and possibilities of renovating religious discourse. To demonstrate this thesis, the paper distinguishes between internal disciplines and external disciplines. Internal disciplines lie within the religious text itself and in the hermeneutic circle between understanding parts of the text and understanding it as a whole, between understanding and pre-understanding, between the inside and the outside. In talking about external disciplines, the paper focuses mainly on the role of the ruling and/or hegemonic political and economic powers and authorities. The paper concludes that renovating religious discourse is a political and institutional issue rather than a purely religious one related to individuals, and that it is conditional on the state and (the reformation of) its political system, and the extent of its actual adoption of the concept of democracy, and the extent to which it protects freedoms, differences, and pluralism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81837547, "asset_id": 73239139, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 148395383, "first_name": "Jurnal", "last_name": "Teosofi", "domain_name": "uinsby", "page_name": "JurnalTeosofi", "display_name": "Jurnal Teosofi", "profile_url": "https://uinsby.academia.edu/JurnalTeosofi?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/148395383/40879174/36880245/s65_jurnal.teosofi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5675, "name": "Kalam (Islamic Theology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kalam_Islamic_Theology_?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16171, "name": "Islamic Political Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Political_Thought?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30552, "name": "Islamic Thought & Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Thought_and_Philosophy?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 59854, "name": "Islamic Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Theology?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 73238964, "title": "Selfhood and Subjectivity in Sufi Thought: Image of a Mole on Emperor Akbar\u2019s Nose", "created_at": "2022-03-07T05:18:19.603-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/73238964/Selfhood_and_Subjectivity_in_Sufi_Thought_Image_of_a_Mole_on_Emperor_Akbar_s_Nose?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_73238964", "summary": "This paper addresses the making of portrait images of Mughal emperors, in which distinctness and particularity in individual features distinguished portraits of emperor Akbar from his ancestors and successors. Scholars have argued that the technique of 'accurate' portraits or mimesis was introduced to Mughal artists with the arrival of renaissance paintings and prints from Europe, brought by Jesuit priests to the Mughal court. However, the question of why Mughal emperors saw a need to arrive at portraiture in the likeness of individuals remains to be addressed. This paper argues that the desire to portray a ruler, in all his individual particularity, can arise only within a literary and intellectual matrix in which the individual is valued and where ideas about selfhood and subjectivity have already permeated the philosophical, political, and literary thought. Tracing the transhistorical and transcultural migration of ideas and motifs from Timurid Central Asia to Mughal India, this paper examines the transference of Sufi thought on image-making practices, particularly portraiture, in the imperial court of the Mughals in early seventeenth century.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81837462, "asset_id": 73238964, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 148395383, "first_name": "Jurnal", "last_name": "Teosofi", "domain_name": "uinsby", "page_name": "JurnalTeosofi", "display_name": "Jurnal Teosofi", "profile_url": "https://uinsby.academia.edu/JurnalTeosofi?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/148395383/40879174/36880245/s65_jurnal.teosofi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14584, "name": "Persianate Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persianate_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17240, "name": "Contemporary Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24788, "name": "Sufism in the West", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_in_the_West?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 28459, "name": "Tariqa Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tariqa_Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 35080, "name": "Sufism in the Formative Period", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_in_the_Formative_Period?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 177375, "name": "Cosmopolitan Sufism & Religiosity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Sufism_and_Religiosity?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 193481, "name": "philosophical Sufism (school of Ibn 'Arabi)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/philosophical_Sufism_school_of_Ibn_Arabi_?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 344616, "name": "Early Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 647028, "name": "Sufism and Tasawwuf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_and_Tasawwuf?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 73238828, "title": "Wa\u1e25dat al-Wuj\u016bd as Post-Avicennian Thought: Comparing Writings on the Basmala by Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b and \u2018Abd al-Kar\u012bm al-J\u012bl\u012b", "created_at": "2022-03-07T05:15:30.737-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/73238828/Wa%E1%B8%A5dat_al_Wuj%C5%ABd_as_Post_Avicennian_Thought_Comparing_Writings_on_the_Basmala_by_Ibn_Arab%C4%AB_and_Abd_al_Kar%C4%ABm_al_J%C4%ABl%C4%AB?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_73238828", "summary": "The article has a two main aims: situating the (post-)Akbarian ideas in the context of Islamic post-classical, esp., post-Avicennian thought and moving the field of the study 'Abd al-Kar\u012bm al-J\u012bl\u012b away from the focus on one work, al-Ins\u0101n al-K\u0101mil, to the inclusion of a broader specter of writings regarded as minor texts.

Yet, as much as mysticism is ineffable as much as the published research is full of tangled definitions that only scholars can comprehend. The traditional approach to the study of Sufism makes the topic burdensome and mentally unattainable to the learned public. This article explains Sufism without using complex terminology or intense presentations of mystical states and stations. It is a scholarly attempt that is ultimately designed to provide a straightforward definition of Sufism. It presents Sufism in a threefold manner, as a synthesis of three Islamic principles: Islamic spirituality, asceticism, and mysticism. Each of the three dimensions is explained in an Islamic context to demonstrate the validity of the Sufi trends as being purely Islamic. Spirituality, asceticism, and mysticism are all discussed within the frame of Tradition, that is, the Qur'\u0101n and the Sunna of the Prophet Muhammad.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81837249, "asset_id": 73238612, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 148395383, "first_name": "Jurnal", "last_name": "Teosofi", "domain_name": "uinsby", "page_name": "JurnalTeosofi", "display_name": "Jurnal Teosofi", "profile_url": "https://uinsby.academia.edu/JurnalTeosofi?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/148395383/40879174/36880245/s65_jurnal.teosofi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17240, "name": "Contemporary Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28459, "name": "Tariqa Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tariqa_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 35080, "name": "Sufism in the Formative Period", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_in_the_Formative_Period?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 35083, "name": "Sufi Metaphysics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufi_Metaphysics?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 177375, "name": "Cosmopolitan Sufism & Religiosity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Sufism_and_Religiosity?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 193481, "name": "philosophical Sufism (school of Ibn 'Arabi)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/philosophical_Sufism_school_of_Ibn_Arabi_?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 647028, "name": "Sufism and Tasawwuf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_and_Tasawwuf?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 71805373, "title": "SUFISM Dispelling Sufism; Reclaiming Asceticism", "created_at": "2022-02-18T07:55:33.017-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/71805373/SUFISM_Dispelling_Sufism_Reclaiming_Asceticism?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_71805373", "summary": "Sufism could be traced to asceticism with the sole aim of becoming a saint or a closer servant of Allaah.

The reformist rhetoric through which this oppositional ideology was articulated was based on a modern scripturalist turn initiated by Sh\u0101h Wal\u012b All\u0101h Dehlawi, but it was also shaped by bigger onto-theological debates in the longer history of Islam. In this paper, we trace how the grand ontotheological debates, such as the debate on wa \u1e25dat al-wuj\u016bd vs. wa \u1e25dat a l-shuh\u016bd, were overdetermined by the encounters between Islam and its others at various intersection points between crisscrossing flows traversing a wide geography. This article explores this question in relation to the expansion of the Ni\u017c\u0101mpur\u012b-Azamgarhi \u1e6dar\u012bqaha reformist Sufi order across the Bengal-Arakan frontier linking South and Southeast Asia. The order spread its roots to Arakan based on preexisting Muslim network consolidated by increasing migration on the back of a rice export economy. The departure of the British colonialists and formation of post-colonial states led to refrontierization at the Bengal-Arakan border, giving rise to politicization of identities and new intensities of violence which decimated the Sufi diaspora in Arakan .", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80392738, "asset_id": 70791919, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1047386, "first_name": "Tahmidal", "last_name": "Zami", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "TZami", "display_name": "Tahmidal  Zami", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/TZami?f_ri=17239", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2906, "name": "Buddhist Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13390, "name": "History of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Bengal?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 18895, "name": "Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangladesh?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 24787, "name": "Neo-Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neo-Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 51858, "name": "Jihad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jihad?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 53953, "name": "Myanmar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Myanmar?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 59470, "name": "Borders and Frontiers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borders_and_Frontiers?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 116870, "name": "Bengali", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bengali?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 158819, "name": "Ilkhanate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ilkhanate?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 238058, "name": "Naqshbandiyya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Naqshbandiyya?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 333824, "name": "Shah Wali Allah", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shah_Wali_Allah?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 552165, "name": "Rohingya Muslims", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rohingya_Muslims?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 952331, "name": "Ibn Al 'Arabi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ibn_Al_Arabi?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 70576290, "title": "Dreams, Shrines and Mystic Sufi in Palestine", "created_at": "2022-02-05T10:06:55.752-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/70576290/Dreams_Shrines_and_Mystic_Sufi_in_Palestine?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_70576290", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80270908, "asset_id": 70576290, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 39852572, "first_name": "aref", "last_name": "abu-rabia", "domain_name": "bgu", "page_name": "arefaburabia", "display_name": "aref abu-rabia", "profile_url": "https://bgu.academia.edu/arefaburabia?f_ri=17239", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 26327, "name": "Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medicine?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 258712, "name": "Mystic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mystic?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 70110855, "title": "The Discussion on Concept of Women Rights in Islamic Sufism", "created_at": "2022-01-31T00:02:28.163-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/70110855/The_Discussion_on_Concept_of_Women_Rights_in_Islamic_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_70110855", "summary": "Sufism usually perceived as only talking or dealing with spiritual matters, basically expressing serving to mankind, and therefore, it should be examined with Islam and women rights.

It accepts all pilgrims without discrimination, including the so-called \u2018third gender\u2019, often referred to as h\u0133ras or kinnars, terms that transgress the socially-defined binary gender divide.

This paper explores certain typological aspects of traditional Sufi ritual and belief that make it particularly receptive to h\u0133ras, and the way in which h\u0133ras in turn appropriate and reconfigure Sufi religious belief to negotiate the tension between the liminality of their lived experience and the exclusive duality of the society around them.

The first section of this paper will examine the historical development of esoteric and Sufi Qur\u2019\u0101nic exegesis, so as to situate Ibn \u2018Aj\u012bba\u2019s Qur\u2019\u0101nic commentary within this genre. A thorough analysis will be given to key features, guiding principles and different methodologies adopted by various esoteric Qur\u2019\u0101nic commentaries. \nThe second section will explore the most influential sources utilized by Ibn \u2018Aj\u012bba in order to form the exoteric and esoteric dimensions of his Qur\u2019\u0101nic commentary. In order to evaluate the extent to which these sources impacted upon the composition of Ibn \u2018Aj\u012bba\u2019s Qur\u2019\u0101nic commentary, an analysis of salient features and the main methodological approaches of these sources will be conducted. It is also important to analyze why Ibn \u2018Aj\u012bba chose certain sources over others, and to clarify the extent to which he depended upon these sources in writing the exoteric and esoteric sections of his Qur\u2019\u0101nic commentary. \nThe third section of this paper will outline the methodology which Ibn \u2018Aj\u012bba adopted when he composed the esoteric dimension of his Qur\u2019\u0101nic commentary. In the conclusion, I will attempt to extract salient features which distinguished Ibn \u2018Aj\u012bba\u2019s Qur\u2019\u0101nic commentary from his predecessors.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 78310584, "asset_id": 67529111, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 36153328, "first_name": "Omneya", "last_name": "Ayad", "domain_name": "uskudar", "page_name": "OmneyaAyad", "display_name": "Omneya Ayad", "profile_url": "https://uskudar.academia.edu/OmneyaAyad?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/36153328/10424347/59551971/s65_omneya.ayad.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 647028, "name": "Sufism and Tasawwuf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_and_Tasawwuf?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 67527262, "title": "Niy\u0101z\u012b Mi\u1e63r\u012b on Poverty (faqr)", "created_at": "2022-01-07T06:40:04.941-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/67527262/Niy%C4%81z%C4%AB_Mi%E1%B9%A3r%C4%AB_on_Poverty_faqr_?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_67527262", "summary": "The Concept of Poverty (faqr) in the Thought of Niy\u0101z\u012b Mi\u1e63r\u012b in His Work Maw\u0101\u2019id al-\u2018irf\u0101n\n\nNiy\u0101z\u012b Mi\u1e63r\u012b (d. 1105/1694) is a prolific author and poet who lived in the Ottoman Empire during the seventeenth century and who left an indelible impact upon Turkish literature and Sufism. Although Niy\u0101z\u012b Mi\u1e63r\u012b was a proponent of the Akbarian school (of Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b) in the first phase of his life, he did not follow blindly the classical line of thought of his predecessors; rather, he developed his own Sufi paradigm wherein his unique ideological beliefs and intellectual thoughts flourished. In addition, living in exile for eighteen years helped to shape his thoughts and widen his perspective, deepening his Sufi experiences which culminated in the composition, very shortly before his death, of his magnum opus entitled, \u201cMaw\u0101\u2019id al-irf\u0101n wa \u2018aw\u0101\u2019id al-i\u1e25s\u0101n\u201d (The Buffet of Gnosis and the Returns of Excellence). Before explaining Niy\u0101z\u012b Mi\u1e63r\u012b\u2019s unique understanding of the concept of poverty and its relationship to other concepts, we will discuss the understandings of earlier Sufis regarding poverty in order to distinguish the degree of development and originality in Niy\u0101z\u012b Mi\u1e63r\u012b\u2019s thought. Niy\u0101z\u012b Mi\u1e63r\u012b has a unique understanding of poverty, equating it with the negation of the temporary existence of all beings, their existence being understood as nothing but an illusion. We also discuss how Niy\u0101z\u012b Mi\u1e63r\u012b related the concept of poverty to other Sufi concepts such as divine trust (am\u0101na), Unity of Being (wa\u1e25dat al-wuj\u016bd), and infidelity (kufr). Niy\u0101z\u012b Mi\u1e63r\u012b concludes that one must strip off one\u2019s own existence as in reality existence only belongs to the One true Being.  Once this realization is reached, only then does God appear, never to conceal Himself again: \u201cOnce poverty is completely reached, then God (appears)\u201d.\n\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 78309429, "asset_id": 67527262, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 36153328, "first_name": "Omneya", "last_name": "Ayad", "domain_name": "uskudar", "page_name": "OmneyaAyad", "display_name": "Omneya Ayad", "profile_url": "https://uskudar.academia.edu/OmneyaAyad?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/36153328/10424347/59551971/s65_omneya.ayad.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 17241, "name": "Sufi Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufi_Poetry?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28459, "name": "Tariqa Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tariqa_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 35083, "name": "Sufi Metaphysics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufi_Metaphysics?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 193481, "name": "philosophical Sufism (school of Ibn 'Arabi)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/philosophical_Sufism_school_of_Ibn_Arabi_?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 344616, "name": "Early Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 647028, "name": "Sufism and Tasawwuf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_and_Tasawwuf?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 67164796, "title": "Hujjat Allah Al-Balighah: The Uniqueness of Shah Wali Allah Al-Dihlawi\u2019s Work", "created_at": "2022-01-04T21:14:56.125-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/67164796/Hujjat_Allah_Al_Balighah_The_Uniqueness_of_Shah_Wali_Allah_Al_Dihlawi_s_Work?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_67164796", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 78085723, "asset_id": 67164796, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 41939761, "first_name": "DR.

Specifically, it focuses on shrines connected with P\u012br Ratann\u0101th, also known as H\u0101jj\u012brattan, a legendary yog\u012b of the N\u0101th samprad\u0101y, widely worshipped across religious boundaries, who is said to have built Dev\u012b P\u0101tan. Through the elusive figure of Ratann\u0101th, I analyse how robust monastic networks focused on pilgrimage, trade and power, \u2018made\u2019 space and borders in the colonial and postcolonial period. Dev\u012b P\u0101tan\u2019s relationship with the Caughera ma\u1e6dh in the Gorkha kingdom of Nepal and the Gorakhn\u0101th ma\u1e6dh in British India and after 1947 illustrates how competitive N\u0101thyog\u012b monastic networks were historically produced and transformed through struggles between monastic institutions over space, resources and power across fraught borders. Ratann\u0101th\u2019s hagiographies, which emphasise his mobility, elasticity and importance in the world of saint veneration, reflect this world in which competing N\u0101thyog\u012b nodes of circulation reworked relationships with each other. Simultaneously, they challenged \u2018fixed\u2019 cartographic boundaries between British India and the Gorkha kingdom of Nepal before 1947, and thereafter of new nation states. My essay also illustrates that histories of monasticism, space and place which have been memorialised by these shrines in representations of Ratann\u0101th and Dev\u012b P\u0101tan in recent times question the hegemonic narratives relating to Ratann\u0101th authorised by the Gorakhn\u0101th ma\u1e6dh, known today for its close alignment with the Sangh Pariv\u0101r, and its exclusionary vision of Hindutv\u0101. Thus, the figure of Ratann\u0101th transcends efforts to subordinate such border-crossing yogis to problematic majoritarian cartographic and political projects.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80444546, "asset_id": 63022117, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12919361, "first_name": "malavika", "last_name": "kasturi", "domain_name": "utoronto", "page_name": "malavikakasturi", "display_name": "malavika kasturi", "profile_url": "https://utoronto.academia.edu/malavikakasturi?f_ri=17239", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2059, "name": "History of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Religion?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21987, "name": "Monasticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Monasticism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33833, "name": "History of Colonial India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Colonial_India?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 82140, "name": "Hindu nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hindu_nationalism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 92458, "name": "Hindutva", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hindutva?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 246553, "name": "Sangh Parivar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sangh_Parivar?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 249304, "name": "Borders and Borderlands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borders_and_Borderlands?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 376562, "name": "Yogis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yogis?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 438900, "name": "Nath Sampraday", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nath_Sampraday?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 971984, "name": "Gurus and Guru Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gurus_and_Guru_Movements?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 62711544, "title": "On the Nature of Reality", "created_at": "2021-11-29T09:19:59.934-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/62711544/On_the_Nature_of_Reality?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_62711544", "summary": "What is the nature of reality? How should be an answer to this question? At this level, we are so deep that all our concepts are obscure. Quantum theory (QT) is at this level. The quest for interpreting it fails because the clarity of our actual fundamental concepts in ordinary language cannot match the precision of the theory's mathematical formalism. The interpretation of quantum mechanics should define and bring clarity to fundamental concepts; not simply rely over them. Quantum theory requires a new worldview, the one that will make it understandable. We discuss on the formulation and interpretation of closed, and final theories, in other words, completely axiomatic theories that define their own conceptual framework, and closed theories that cannot be made simpler. We claim that everything we can properly say about a theory follows from its interpretation, and that interpreting is saying the meaning of each of its mathematical statements. We argue that quantum mechanics is a closed theory; and, therefore, that part of it is part of the final or fundamental theory of physics (FTP). We propose a new entirely axiomatic formulation of part of quantum theory (including all its mathematical framework) in which new powerful and useful elements are added to the existing formalism, and Dirac's notation becomes properly an algebra. Our interpretation is straightforward: it allows us reading or saying the meaning of each of the theory's axiom, theorem or element. We state that the proposed theory is the FTP. Its interpretation may dissolve most of the existing paradoxes around QT. The principle of excluded middle is not valid in general. Both epistemic and ontic elements are present in the theory since it is a theory of knowledge and truth. This and other fundamental concepts are defined by the theory, which can represent both reality and our knowledge about it.

What love can be, what love can do, how to find it, keep it, give it and take it, are some of the questions that flow throughout this exploration. Looking at love from three points of view, that of a negative, of a positive and of a zero, Deborah Zannat argues that true love is divine yet within human endeavour. That cultivating love requires strong discipline and restraint, which she names the taming of the mind, related to the negative, to subtraction; it also requires positive acts of caring, that love is what love does, as Lalon Shah highlighted the five qualities of love according to Sri Chaitanya, related to addition. And most difficult of all, located in the dangerous fertility of the zero, the necessity of baring the mind to settle in peaceful, selfless, true and constructive acts of love \u2013 and this does not occur without struggle and resistance, without alluring traps and great risks. While Sufis claim to be the only path of love, Deborah Zannat here shows that any complete mystical boon necessarily yields love, whichever path may have been walked to acquire it. And that this pure divine love is human\u2019s highest achievement.

Comment The course will focus on issues of comparative religions, especially the question of how far typical aspects of religious reform can be identified. The historical context, the personal impulse, the emerging polemics, the institutional conflicts, the structural changes in religious reforms will be investigated. Sources to be studied will include writings and letters by Martin Luther (1483-1546) on the side of Christianity, and by Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi (1564-1624) on the side of Islam. The aim is to identify relevant parallel developments within the religious cultures of Europe and India in the 16th-17th centuries. The course will probably be rescheduled to Tuesday 12-14.

"summary": "This article and the corresponding genealogy compare two teaching and learning lines of the reformist Naqshbandiyya-Mujaddid\u012byya Sufi order in the Indo-Afghan borderlands in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It describes the strategies of social engagement of the mobile mull\u0101s of the Akhund Ghaff\u016br-Hadd\u0101 Mull\u0101 line and those of the p\u012brs of the kh\u0101nqah (Sufi lodge)-centered line of Khw\u0101j\u0101h Usm\u0101n D\u0101man\u012b. The concurrent establishment of these two Sufi lines in the northwestern borderlands of colonial India was an important historical phenomenon inspired by a \u2018reformed\u2019 Mujaddid\u012b practice and the two Sufi lines were comparable because of their roots in Mujaddid\u012b reformism. I argue, however, that the two Sufi lines must also be differentiated because of the loci of their participation in and mediation of the day-to-day affairs of practising communities. Members of the Hadd\u0101 Mull\u0101\u2019s line dispersed among the Pashtun borderland communities to enforce religious priorities from day to day, while members of Usm\u0101n D\u0101man\u012b\u2019s line consciously confined their activities to the kh\u0101nqah. The patterns of activity of the members of the two Mujaddid\u012b lines suggest a new framework for understanding the relationship between Islam and politics in the Indo-Afghan borderlands: it was not the ideological approach to Islam, but the spatial imaginaries employed by the frontier Sufis which produced their respective political agendas and impact.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86564347, "asset_id": 53235188, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 86562452, "asset_id": 53235188, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1499127, "first_name": "Sana", "last_name": "Haroon", "domain_name": "um-boston", "page_name": "sanaharoon", "display_name": "Sana Haroon", "profile_url": "https://um-boston.academia.edu/sanaharoon?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1499127/24237296/42799451/s65_sana.haroon.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 52715550, "title": "Essays", "created_at": "2021-09-18T07:15:55.153-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/52715550/Essays?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_52715550", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 101246283, "asset_id": 52715550, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26964169, "first_name": "S.P.", "last_name": "Ward (Ph.D.)", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "StevenParrisWard", "display_name": "S.P.

I argue that Stewart\u2019s presentation falls short of taking account of the socio-syncratic nature and cross-sectarian addressivity of the works. Hakim\u2019s contention on the question amounted to a paradigm shift in polyglossic religious traditions of Bengal.

In the Dutch dunes near Katwijk a Suf\u0133i temple was built in commemoration of the Chishti sage Inayat Khan (d. 1927), a monument which serves as a clarifying case study of the seemingly confusing phenomenon where a shared example from Islamic architectural history, in this instance the Taj Mahal, may be transformed in the modern western landscape in such a manner that neither the prototypical origin nor the contemporary connection between the end results would be recognizable to anyone but a very small number of insiders. Based on a complete chronological reconstruction of the design process of the Katwijk temple, it appears that major shifts in the iconography of this 'Universel' occurred even in mid-construction, alternating with competing successors to Inayat Khan and their divergent interpretations of their master's theological legacy as either Islamic or universal.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68657360, "asset_id": 50790812, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 183840719, "first_name": "Eric", "last_name": "Roose", "domain_name": "leidenuni", "page_name": "EricRoose", "display_name": "Eric R .

It privileges submissions that, in addition to Sindh and Sindhis, tackle topics like colonialism and nationalism, integration and marginalization, devotion and institutionalization, vernacularism and cosmopolitanism, and many others.

We tried to collect data from secondary sources and found that various superstitions entered Sufism when many non-Islamic issues permeated Islam. Imam Rabbani has made tireless efforts in writings and discourses through Sufism to return Islam to its original purity. He was awarded the title of \"Reformer of the second millennium\" because he first introduced Islamic thought in the history of the Indian subcontinent.

It is considered the first treatise on Sufism in Persian language, as well as one of the most read books on Sufism. It offers valuable information on the doctrines, practices and ethics of Sufism along with the biographies of renowned early sufis. Like many other early sufi texts, Kashf al-ma\u1e25j\u016bb is a hybrid text, combining features of varied genres of sufi literature, hence denying any neat genre classification. It has generally been considered a survey or handbook of Sufism. The present study is an attempt to analyze the debate on its genre classification. The present study contends the prevalent view, as its biographical section, which forms a major portion of the said work, casts doubt on its exclusive branding as a sufi manual. It argues that Kashf al-ma\u1e25j\u016bb cannot be treated exclusively as a sufi manual or a \u1e6dabaq\u0101 owing to its rich biographical material. In other words, it is more than a sufi manual. Furthermore, the study argues that Kashf al-ma\u1e25j\u016bb partly appears to be a proto-tadhkirah as well due to its biographical content, since it was produced at the time when the development of the genre of tadhkirah writing had not yet originated. It served as a model for writing the first tadhkirah of sufi literary history, i.e. Tadhkirat al-awliy\u0101 by \u2018A\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101r.

In the canon of modern Arabic literature as a whole, he has a secure place as a pioneer of a particular style of writing that linked modern Arabic fiction to its past heritage through language and narrative form. He was also an anti-colonial militant and prominent politician in the postindependence state. Born in T\uf0e0zarka on January 28, 1911, al-Mas\uf027ad\uf0ec was educated at al-Madrasa al-\uf0cd\uf0e0diqiyya-founded by the reformer Khayr al-D\uf0ecn Pasha (d. 1890)-from 1921 until 1932; and he attended the French Lyc\u00e9e Carnot, Zayt\uf0f9na University, al-Khald\uf0f9niyya, and the Sorbonne between the years 1933 and 1936. Later, he would have an impact on these same institutions, both as a teacher and as the architect of Tunisia's educational policy between 1958 and 1968. He was also minister of cultural affairs from 1973 to 1976 and founder of the monthly magazine al-\uf0d3ay\uf0e0t al-thaq\uf0e0fiyya (\"Cultural life\"), which continues to be published today.

The challenging aspect in this way is the financial security which works against the greedy nature of a Man. In addition to Huq\u016bq al-Allah, Islam also stresses on Huq\u016bq al-'Ib\u0101d, wherein helping someone economically becomes an important facet. To bring this idea into action, an institution has been developed named as 'Waqf' which provides all possible help to the downtrodden and marginalized section of the society. It plays very substantial role in the overall prosperity of both Muslims and non-Muslims.

threatening currently. Although at the moment radical actions, such as suicide bombings, have been inactive in Indonesia, the ideology of terrorism remains latent. It is in this light  that Indonesian government, including the Ministry of Religious Affairs, has promulgated and disseminated the programs of \u201cderadicalization of religiousity\u201d, because one of the radical roots of the terrorism lies in the religiousity of the doers. The current paper takes part in the framework of the \u201cderadicalization of religiousity\u201d by promoting what Stepaniants called \u201cSufi Wisdom.\u201d  In this case, a special reference will be made to the theory of latha\u2019if (subtle centers) exposed by Kyai Muslih al-Maraqi (1917-1981), a prominent figure in a well-known Sufi order in Indonesia (Thariqat Qadiriyyah wa Naqsyabandiyyah, TQN), a son of Kyai Abdurrahman, the founder of Pesantren Futuhiyyah, Mranggen, Demak, Central Java. \nKyai Muslih, through his three kitabs (Islamic books), that is, \u2018Umdah as-Salik, al-Futuhat ar-Rabbaniyyah, and Risalah Tuntunan Thariqah, had made a legacy of harmonious life through his theory of latha\u2019if. Benefitting from the theory of nafs of Imam Nawawi al-Bantani, Kyai Muslih succeeded in incorporating a theory of latha\u2019if that is beneficial for humans not only to be harmonious with God, but with other humans as well. Imam Nawawi al-Bantani, in his Qathr al-Ghaits, exposed seven types of nafs, including  ammarah, lawwamah, mulhamah, muthmainnah, radliyah, mardliyyah,  and kamilah, each of which has certain \u201carmy\u201d in human being. The first two nafs will be extremely dangerous if they are left wild in human being. They both will even lead to, among others, terrorism if they take the command of the \u201carmy\u201d in human being. Moreover, the two nafs cannot be controlled unless the rest of the nafs are activated. How to activate the rest of the nafs? It is in this part that Kyai Muslih plays the role. \nKyai Muslih suggested that each of the nafs sits in one of seven latha\u2019if in human being. The seven latha\u2019if includes: al-qalb, ar-ruh, as-sirr, al-khafi, al-akhfa\u2019, an-nafs, and al-qalab. Nafs ammarah sits in the lathifah (singular of latha\u2019if) an-nafs; nafs lawwamah in lathifah al-qalb; nafs mulhamah in  lathifah ar-ruh; nafs muthmainnah in lathifah as-sirr; nafs ar-radliyah in lathifah al-qalab; nafs al-mardliyah in lathifah al-khafi; and nafs al-kamilah in lathifah al-akhfa\u2019. To take control of the first two nafs (ammarah and lawwamah), and to strengthen the rest of the nafs, certain action must be made, that is by performing a recollection called zikr latha\u2019if, concentrating zikr  to certain lathifah. \nBy zikr latha\u2019if, human being proceeds in two ways: up and down. Firstly, human beings contemplate and remember God; and secondly they will gain in return the emanation of divine beauty and peace. This circumstance will lead the person who perfoms the zikr latha\u2019if to peaceful life in him/her self, that will in turn also resonance to others. Therefore, Kyai Muslih\u2019s theory of latha\u2019if is not only ascending humans to heavenly dimension, but also elevating the quality of humanity, that is the ability to be in harmony with

While this \u201ctranslation movement\u201d (Ernst, 2003: 173) had long been attributed to the reputedly liberal, tolerant, and enlightened personal inclinations of the Mughal emperors, scholars in recent decades have begun to re-evaluate the phenomenon, arguing instead that practical socio-political considerations and quotidian cultural processes best explain the nature of the translation movement. What such analyses lack, however, is a sustained consideration of how the Islamic \u2013 and, in particular, Sufi \u2013 worldview(s) of the nobles in question shaped the inner workings of, and motivations behind, this movement. In this essay, I take up one such translation from the Mughal period \u2013 Mir Findiriski\u2019s Muntakhab-i Jug Basisht, a translation of the Sanskrit Laghu-Yoga-Vasistha \u2013 examining not only its content in relation to the Sanskrit original, but also the manner in which Sufi thought and metaphysics informed the very process of translation itself.\n\nDurant l\u2019apog\u00e9e de l\u2019Empire moghol en Asie du Sud pr\u00e9coloniale (XVIe et XVIIe si\u00e8cles de notre \u00e8re), des nobles musulmans ont facilit\u00e9 la traduction de nombreux textes sanscrits hindous en persan. M\u00eame si ce \u00ab mouvement de traduction \u00bb (Ernst, 2003: 173) a \u00e9t\u00e9 longtemps attribu\u00e9 aux inclinations personnelles r\u00e9put\u00e9es lib\u00e9rales, tol\u00e9rantes et \u00e9clair\u00e9es des empereurs moghols, les chercheurs au cours des derni\u00e8res d\u00e9cennies ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9\u00e9valuer le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne, soutenant plut\u00f4t que des consid\u00e9rations pratiques sociopolitiques et des processus culturels quotidiens expliquent bien mieux la nature de ce \u00ab mouvement de traduction \u00bb. Cependant, ce qui fait d\u00e9faut \u00e0 ces analyses, c\u2019est la consid\u00e9ration soutenue de la mani\u00e8re dont les vision(s) du monde islamique \u2013 soufi tout particuli\u00e8rement \u2013 des nobles ont fa\u00e7onn\u00e9 les rouages \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur, et les motivations \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re, de ce mouvement.

(1615-1659) was reknowed Sufi, author, poet, and translator of Hindu Religious Testimonies. He is the eldest son of Shahjahan and designated crown prince. He occupied a unique position among all Mughal princes because of his comparative study of Islamic mysticism and classical Hindu philosophy. Dara Shikoh greatly worked for the Indo- Islamic mysticism by highlighting the similarities between ancient Hindu and Islamic Sufi teachings. He not only followed the liberal religious attitude of his grandfather Akbar but gave a new dimension to Indo-Islamic Mysticism in India and it spread all over the world through his mystical works. Dara Shikoh being a disciple of Mian Mir Qadari and a great follower of Qadari order of Sufism devoted his much time for the search of truth. And during his study and research he felt that the search for God (truth) was same at all the times and all over the world. He preached the mingling of classical Hindu philosophy and Islamic Mysticism and always tried to find the common grounds between these two thoughts so that a healthier tradition could be produced, that will lead to universal brotherhood among the followers of different religions, which is outmost need of the present world. This was crux of Indo-Islamic Mysticism produced by the Dara Shikoh. He was executed by his younger brother Aurangzeb on political and religious basis. Aurangzeb was a stanch Sunnie Muslim, who followed the policy of intolerance with Hindus and spiritual persons like Dara Shikoh and the great Sufi sage and Persian poet Sarmad.",

regarding it in him and, more significantly, due to Mawd\u016bd\u012b' scholarship's atomistic reading of his key statements. For addressing this key problem, this paper critiques atomistic reading and explores certain background methodological issues and reflections on definitions of Sufism besides key points in his life and work.

It has been argued that the concepts contained in the Quran cannot easily or appropriately be translated in other languages. In other words, other languages cannot grasp and capture the true meaning, essence and spirit of the Quran. Moreover, the task of translating the Quran in any language is considered to be difficult owing to conceptual, theological and linguistic limitations. Despite that, there have been uncountable attempts at translating the Quran in various languages. However, a translation of the Quran in any language is considered to be an interpretation, and not merely a translation. According to this view, translation subtly changes the meaning, and is thus called interpretation. Therefore, any attempt at translating the Quran is, in fact, an exegetical attempt. Historically, until recently such attempts had generally been looked upon with suspicion rather than admiration. Translations of the Quran in the languages such as Turkish, Persian and Urdu have now been generally approved of by the traditionalists. These so-called 'Islamized languages' contain many Arabic loan words. So while reading these translations, the reader can easily identify with/relate to the Qur'anic concepts, since the Quranic-Arabic religious terminology is retained. Translations in European languages such as English and German do not seem to be much objectionable to them. However, the case of translations of the Quran in languages such as Hindi, which are relatively uncommon, is somewhat different. Fazle Rahman's Hindi-Purabi translation of the Quran titled Manmohan ki Batain is one such attempt, which remained incomplete. Shah Fazle Rahman (b. 1208/1793-d. 1313/1895) of Ganj Muradabad was a Naqshbandi Sufi, and the founder of Silsilah-i Rahmaniyya, a sub-lineage of Naqshbandiyya, which is named after him.

The sufis in South Asia have played a very crucial role in history, society, culture as well as politics. Many of them tried to vernacularize the message of Islam and Sufism, translating it in local context, and thus making the understanding and practice of Islam easier for the new converts. What made many of these sufis particularly endearing was their conviction in 'love for all' and religious inclusiveness, rooted in their belief in transcendent unity of all religions. This worldview is well-reflected in many genres of sufi literature including malfuz (conversations of the sufis) collections, tadhkirahs (hagiographical works), theosophical treatises as well as poetic compositions. Though the national narrative in Pakistan is not altogether silent on the role of sufis in South Asian history, it selectively highlights the role of some sufi groups, such as the Naqshbandi-Mujaddidis. The sufis in general are presented as 'missionaries' or proselytizers of Islam, and as reformists fostering separate Muslim identity and consciousness among the new converts to Islam. There is historiographical silence on the role and contribution of many celebrated sufis belonging to Chishti, Qadri, Shattari, Suhrawardi, Firdawsi and other silsilahs, as none of them find any mention in the national narrative, nor their contribution in developing a social ethos reflecting religious harmony and cultural assimilation of the migrant Turco-Persian elite and the local popular Indian culture is acknowledged. The proposed paper argues that the national narrative tends to view the past through the lens of the present day values, norms and contemporary realities. In its bid to justify the Two-nation Theory based on the idea of a perpetual Hindu-Muslim antagonism and separatism, it cites select historical evidence that supports this thesis. In fact, the narrative tries to press data in the service of a nationalist agenda. Marred by reductionism, the narrative projects a relatively distorted view of the past, ignoring the role and contribution of the sufis in South Asian social, cultural, religious and intellectual history in a holistic sense.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65548138, "asset_id": 45003844, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9027805, "first_name": "Tanvir", "last_name": "Anjum", "domain_name": "qau", "page_name": "TanvirAnjum", "display_name": "Tanvir Anjum", "profile_url": "https://qau.academia.edu/TanvirAnjum?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9027805/3012440/3726097/s65_tanvir.anjum.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3524, "name": "Historiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historiography?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48150, "name": "Pakistan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 647028, "name": "Sufism and Tasawwuf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_and_Tasawwuf?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 45003827, "title": "The Voice of the Soul-bride: Bridal Symbolism in Sufi Poetry of Bulhe Shah (Paper presented at the Int'l Conference on \u201cLanguage, Literature and Society,\u201d organized by the Pakistan Academy of Letters, 5-8 Jan, 2017).", "created_at": "2021-01-29T01:02:53.299-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45003827/The_Voice_of_the_Soul_bride_Bridal_Symbolism_in_Sufi_Poetry_of_Bulhe_Shah_Paper_presented_at_the_Intl_Conference_on_Language_Literature_and_Society_organized_by_the_Pakistan_Academy_of_Letters_5_8_Jan_2017_?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_45003827", "summary": "for International Conference on \"Language, Literature and Society\" (to be held in March 2016) In Sufism, the mystical tradition of Islam, the concept of Divine love is quite central, and that is why, it is often referred to as the 'way of love'. One of the earliest articulations of the notion of selfless and unconditional love for God is attributed to an eighth-century sufi woman named Rabiah al-Adawiyah of Basrah (d. 801), who preached that one must love God for Himself alone, neither out of fear of hell, nor in greed for paradise. Later it became one of the major themes in sufi literature, and was further developed by sufi theorists like Ibn al-'Arabi (d. 1240) and Jalal al-Din Rumi (d. 1273). The poetic articulation of transcendent experience of Divine love by the sufis is often characterized by gendered imagery, since it has been (and can only be) expressed in metaphorical and figurative language by employing the idioms of temporal human love. Reversing their gender, many male sufi poets in premodern Punjab assumed the female persona. They spoke in the voice of ardent feminine lovers, while portraying God as the male Beloved. These sufi poets often evoked bridal metaphor as well, and identified themselves with a waiting bride or a loyal and devoted wife, whereas the Divine Self was symbolized by a groom or husband. The bridal symbolism is a well-attested tradition in South Asian sufi literature, particularly in sufi poetry in vernacular languages. The poetic exegesis of the Punjabi verses of Bulhe Shah of Qasur (1680-1758)-a sufi Qadiri-Shattari spiritual lineage, reveal that the bridal metaphor was not only indigenized and situated in context of local cultural ethos and literary conventions by him, its use was also expanded by him through borrowing rich imagery from socio-cultural topography of premodern Punjab.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65548122, "asset_id": 45003827, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9027805, "first_name": "Tanvir", "last_name": "Anjum", "domain_name": "qau", "page_name": "TanvirAnjum", "display_name": "Tanvir Anjum", "profile_url": "https://qau.academia.edu/TanvirAnjum?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9027805/3012440/3726097/s65_tanvir.anjum.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17241, "name": "Sufi Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufi_Poetry?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 134234, "name": "Punjabi Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Punjabi_Literature?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 199271, "name": "Punjab Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Punjab_Studies?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 647028, "name": "Sufism and Tasawwuf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_and_Tasawwuf?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 1769946, "name": "Punjabi language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Punjabi_language?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 45003816, "title": "Devotional Sufi Music (Sam\u0101\u2019) in Chishti Sufism in South Asia (Paper presented at \u201cInt'i Conference on Muslim & Buddhist Sacred Art and Architecture\u201d organized by World Fellowship of the Buddhist Youth (Bangkok, Thailand), and Society of Civilizations (Pakistan), on 27-28 Dec, 2016).", "created_at": "2021-01-29T00:59:16.487-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45003816/Devotional_Sufi_Music_Sam%C4%81_in_Chishti_Sufism_in_South_Asia_Paper_presented_at_Inti_Conference_on_Muslim_and_Buddhist_Sacred_Art_and_Architecture_organized_by_World_Fellowship_of_the_Buddhist_Youth_Bangkok_Thailand_and_Society_of_Civilizations_Pakistan_on_27_28_Dec_2016_?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_45003816", "summary": "The use of music in Islam is a controversial question. Some out rightly reject it as un-Islamic, whereas others argue for its permissibility with conditions. Sufism or tasawwuff, the mystical tradition of Islam, lays great emphasis on inner meaning of all ritual observances. There are varied positions of sufi silsilahs/orders or individual sufis on sama (devotional sufi music). For instance, the sufis associated with Naqshbandiyya Mujaddidiyya tradition are generally considered anti-sama, but those associated with Mevlawiyya in Turkey and Chistiyya in South Asia are particularly known for their pro-sama stance. According to the latter groups, sama is permitted for ahl-i hal but not for the ahl-i qal. An early sufi, Dhu'l-Nun Misri (d. 861) stated: \"Sama is a Divine influence which stirs the heart to see Allah; those who listen to it spiritually attain to Allah, and those who listen to it sensually fall into heresy.\" To sufis, sama is a form of dhikr (remembrance of God), and it is a source of mystic transcendence or transportation toward union with God. It activates one's link with a living spiritual guide, with the departed sufis of one's spiritual genealogy, and ultimately with God.

The sufi notion of universal or cosmic love embraces the entire universe and the creation within. To the sufis, this cosmic love-the cause behind all causes-brings out all existence out of nothingness. One of the earliest articulations of the notion of disinterested/selfless and unconditional love for God is attributed to an eighth-century sufi woman named Rabiah al-Adawiyah of Basrah (d. 801), who preached that one must love God for Himself alone, neither out of fear of hell, nor in greed for paradise. This notion of Divine love later became one of the major themes in sufi literature, and was further developed by sufis like Jalal al-Din Rumi (d. 1273) who elaborated upon the sufi philosophy of 'ishq (intensified love coupled with passionate longing), and argued that the human souls had been separated from their Divine source of origin, and so had a burning desire to return to it. The poetic articulation of transcendent experience of Divine love by the sufis is often characterized by gendered imagery, since it has been (and can only be) expressed in metaphorical and figurative language by employing the idioms of temporal human love. Reversing their gender, many male sufi poets in premodern Punjab assumed the female persona. They spoke in the voice of ardent feminine lovers, while portraying God as the male Beloved. These sufi poets often evoked bridal metaphor as well, and identified themselves with a waiting bride or a loyal and devoted wife, whereas the Divine Self was symbolized by a groom or husband. This phenomenon of 'bridal mysticism' or the notion of spiritual marriage can be found in mystical traditions of other world religions. The idea of 'Bride of God' is found in the Old and New Testaments, as well as in Catholicism, Judaism, Vaishnavite Hinduism, Bhakti tradition and Sikhism. The bridal symbolism is a well-attested tradition in South Asian sufi literature, particularly in sufi poetry in vernacular languages like Hindavi, Punjabi, Sindhi, Saraiki, Gujrati and Marathi, etc. The poetic exegesis of the Punjabi verses of Shah Husayn of Lahore (1539-1593)-a libertine and non-conformist sixteenth-century sufi, reveal that the bridal metaphor was not only indigenized and situated in context of local cultural ethos and literary conventions by him, its use was also expanded by him through borrowing rich imagery from socio-cultural topography of premodern Punjab.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65547976, "asset_id": 45003716, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9027805, "first_name": "Tanvir", "last_name": "Anjum", "domain_name": "qau", "page_name": "TanvirAnjum", "display_name": "Tanvir Anjum", "profile_url": "https://qau.academia.edu/TanvirAnjum?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9027805/3012440/3726097/s65_tanvir.anjum.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1138, "name": "Women's Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17241, "name": "Sufi Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufi_Poetry?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 647028, "name": "Sufism and Tasawwuf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_and_Tasawwuf?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 44999461, "title": "Houndstongue Gemstones", "created_at": "2021-01-28T09:53:55.935-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44999461/Houndstongue_Gemstones?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_44999461", "summary": "A brief review of Punjabi poet Nasreen Anjum Bhatti's life & work on the occasion of her death in 2016.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65542996, "asset_id": 44999461, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1257461, "first_name": "Waqas", "last_name": "Khwaja", "domain_name": "agnesscott", "page_name": "WaqasKhwaja", "display_name": "Waqas Khwaja", "profile_url": "https://agnesscott.academia.edu/WaqasKhwaja?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1257461/459614/86243362/s65_waqas.khwaja.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12760, "name": "Postcolonial Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Feminism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15863, "name": "Postcolonial Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Literature?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 134234, "name": "Punjabi Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Punjabi_Literature?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 496484, "name": "Protest and State Repression", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Protest_and_State_Repression?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44995873, "title": "Can Hujwiri's Kashf al-Mahjub be considered a Proto-Tadhkirah?

It is considered the first treatise on Sufism in Persian language, as well as one of the most read books on Sufism. It offers valuable information on the doctrines, practices and ethics of Sufism along with the biographies of renowned early sufis. Like many other early sufi texts, Kashf al-ma\u1e25j\u016bb is a hybrid text, combining features of varied genres of sufi literature, hence denying any neat genre classification. It has generally been considered a survey or handbook of Sufism. The present study is an attempt to analyze the debate on its genre classification. The present study contends the prevalent view, as its biographical section, which forms a major portion of the said work, casts doubt on its exclusive branding as a sufi manual. It argues that Kashf al-ma\u1e25j\u016bb cannot be treated exclusively as a sufi manual or a \u1e6dabaq\u0101 owing to its rich biographical material. In other words, it is more than a sufi manual. Furthermore, the study argues that Kashf al-ma\u1e25j\u016bb partly appears to be a proto-tadhkirah as well due to its biographical content, since it was produced at the time when the development of the genre of tadhkirah writing had not yet originated. It served as a model for writing the first tadhkirah of sufi literary history, i.e. Tadhkirat al-awliy\u0101 by \u2018A\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101r.

This article mainly focuses on vernacular Sufi literature which included a variety of genres, ranging from esoteric doctrines to popular advice literature or heroic narratives. It briefly surveys how different genres reflected the approaches of vernacular Sufi litterateurs to the problem of translation, religion, and interreligious relations. The survey brings out certain ideational and material aspects of Bengali Sufi literary culture that show the rich complexity of ontological and theological conceptualization of the Sufis, often transcending narrow sectarian boundaries of Muslims and various Hindu sects, and evoking complex problematization of gender in a overall patriarchal framework. Islam was conveyed to a great extent through stories and lyrics rather than the dry skeleton of rules and precepts. Islam was approached in a creative, exploratory mode by confabulation and reworking of stories, a phenomenon we would call storification of religion. Such storification helped accommodation and eventual integration of a new religion into the preexisting cultural tradition in an accessible form followed by transformation of the tradition itself. In transmitting esoteric doctrines or popular narratives, the Sufis engaged in a process of cultural mediation dealing with problems of creating equivalence between the Islamicate and the indic, establishing new codes and norms of vernacular conceptualization of Islam, and drawing new boundaries of identity while outmoding older ones.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65502585, "asset_id": 44968006, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1047386, "first_name": "Tahmidal", "last_name": "Zami", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "TZami", "display_name": "Tahmidal  Zami", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/TZami?f_ri=17239", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 51029, "name": "Medieval Indian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_Indian_History?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 647028, "name": "Sufism and Tasawwuf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_and_Tasawwuf?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 44943267, "title": "Nourrir les vivants par la gr\u00e2ce des saints.

Sufism is noted as an arena of spiritual/religious practice that highlights musical routes to the Divine. Among Chishti Sufis of South Asia, that musical pathway is qawwali, a song form that been in circulation for over seven centuries, and which continues to maintain a vibrant sonic presence on the subcontinent, both in its ritual usage among Sufis and more broadly in related folk and popular iterations. This paper asks, what happens to qawwali as a song form when it circulates in diaspora? While prominent musicians such as the Sabri Brothers and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan exposed audiences in the West to the sounds of qawwali, in recent years, non-hereditary groups of musicians based in the US and UK have begun to perform songs from the qawwali repertoire. In the traditional setting, textual meaning is paramount; this paper asks, how can performers transmute the a\u21b5ective capacity of qawwali in settings where semantic forms of communication may be lost? How do sonic and metaphorical voices lend themselves to the circulation of sound-centered meaning? Through a discussion of the Sufi sublime, this paper considers ways sonic materials stitch together the diverse cloth of the South Asian community in diaspora.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65276169, "asset_id": 44783050, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3859733, "first_name": "Sonia", "last_name": "Gaind-Krishnan", "domain_name": "nyu", "page_name": "SoniaGaind", "display_name": "Sonia Gaind-Krishnan", "profile_url": "https://nyu.academia.edu/SoniaGaind?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3859733/32346667/36694921/s65_sonia.gaind.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1987, "name": "Ethnomusicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnomusicology?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7212, "name": "Sound studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sound_studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28115, "name": "South Asian Diasporas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Diasporas?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 543144, "name": "Sufi Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufi_Music?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 741838, "name": "Qawwali", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qawwali?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 44780535, "title": "Shaikh Fazlullah: A Suhrawardi Sufi of Delhi", "created_at": "2020-12-27T02:38:25.584-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44780535/Shaikh_Fazlullah_A_Suhrawardi_Sufi_of_Delhi?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_44780535", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65272891, "asset_id": 44780535, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2811313, "first_name": "Salim", "last_name": "Zaweed", "domain_name": "presiuniv", "page_name": "salimzaweed", "display_name": "Salim Zaweed", "profile_url": "https://presiuniv.academia.edu/salimzaweed?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2811313/919881/37642333/s65_salim.zaweed.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 39060, "name": "Suhrawardi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Suhrawardi?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 135911, "name": "Delhi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Delhi?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 44740324, "title": "Afterword to Figuring Religion: Comparing Ideas, Images, and Activities (SUNY Press: 2013), pp. 263-280.", "created_at": "2020-12-19T17:04:14.005-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44740324/Afterword_to_Figuring_Religion_Comparing_Ideas_Images_and_Activities_SUNY_Press_2013_pp_263_280?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_44740324", "summary": "This Afterword reviews the essays in Figuring Religion: Comparing Ideas, Images, and Activities, edited by Subha Pathak (SUNY Press: 2013).

medieval Indian history writing in modern age academically started under the effort of colonial British scholars. Initially, their main objective was to be acquainted profoundly with the cultural heritage, tradition and rituals of India which could facilitate the process of imperial expansion as well as to set up psychological sway over the diversity of inhabitants, religion and region. In that case, medieval period was near past to British rule because although Mughals lost their power but still the influence of administrative practices had not fully been eliminated from the root of Indian subcontinent. Hence, these scholars intended to explore medieval period with two major perspective-one is the translation of medieval Indian sources and another is the writing of medieval Indian history. However, we need to clarify one thing here that these colonial scholars were not professional historian even they had no philosophical and methodological concept of history, therefore, their compositions were mostly associated with politics and administration where less emphasis has given to society, culture, peoples and economic history. That's why, they had no effort to write a 'total history' of medieval India. The writing of Medieval Indian history by Indian historian said to have begun as a counter force against British colonial thought, but despite in some cases the nationalist historians were held responsible to distort the impartial historical perception. In this respect, it is essential to know that although these scholars claimed to be the founder of anti-British opinion but they seemed to be invisibly biased, especially with the idea of Hindu-Muslim glory. Rightly pointed out by Romila Thapar \"an examination of the ideology of modern communalism shows quite clearly that it seeks its intellectual justification from the historical past. Thus, Hindu communalist try and project an ideal Hindu society in the ancient period \u2026. Equally, Muslim communalists try and prove the roots of separatism from the beginning of the medieval period onwards, i.e. from the 11 th or 13 th century AD.\" 1 The Muslim historian of colonial period used the same approach to praise this period as much as they can and very strategically, they concealed the shortcomings of this period. In that case the example of Muhammed Habib can be alluded who argued for a rural and urban revolution during the Delhi Sultanate. He disseminated that the Ghorian Turks replaced the Thakurs as the ruling class and then imparted the Indian city-worker who had been compelled to live outside of main city in accordance to Brahmanical order, the Turks manumitted them from this restriction. Habib in his most genuine work \"Mahmud of Ghaznin\" had tried to restore a figure of Mahmud not as a Muslim warrior but as corrupted. We have another work of Muhammad Nazim \"The Life and Times of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazna\", here he remarked that Mahmud's aim was not iconoclasm, and was not fanatic because he had not aimed to demolish Hindu temple at time of peace 2. A dissention has been apparent from the opinion of K.M. Ashraf because he didn't visualize any such revolution in Indian life during that period. He was presumably the first historian of this group to define a materialistic picture of this century. As he opined directly \"Islam was not a fundamental revolution in the basic condition of Indian life...\" 3. One of a leading historian of medieval India I.H. Qureshi who had worked upon the Administration of Delhi Sultanate and Mughal period. He blindly treated the both period as welfare state based on tolerance, benevolence in which Hindus were not ill-treated. Prof. Qureshi was the path-finder of S.M. Ikram and Mainul Haq. Specially, in the context of Akbar's policy making prof. Qureshi has given a religious fundamentalistic interpretation, \"the most obvious Abstract: \"History\" as a prominent discipline of Social science is co-related with two basic philosophical treatment namely-subjectivity and objectivity. In 21 st century, precisely after the invention of new historical method objectivity has given the first priority to write true history based on fully unbiased and scientific introspection through which a historian or scholar works as a judge for the reconstruction of impartial subjective analysis. However, individual lives are bounded by numerous psychological behaviors, therefore, it is very difficult to exempt completely from biasness. But it is possible to reach in very approximation of truth as told by renowned historian R.C. Majumdar \"the ascertainment of truth, so far it can be ascertained\u2026is the one object, the one sanction, of all historical studies\".", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65075412, "asset_id": 44610695, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 75922183, "first_name": "Imon ul", "last_name": "Hossain", "domain_name": "visvabharati", "page_name": "ImonulHossain", "display_name": "Imon ul Hossain", "profile_url": "https://visvabharati.academia.edu/ImonulHossain?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/75922183/34524587/35280311/s65_imon_ul.hossain.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 51029, "name": "Medieval Indian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_Indian_History?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44601011, "title": "Diyanet \u0130slam Ansiklopedisi Dinler Tarihi Maddeleri", "created_at": "2020-11-29T13:45:05.594-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44601011/Diyanet_%C4%B0slam_Ansiklopedisi_Dinler_Tarihi_Maddeleri?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_44601011", "summary": "D\u0130A'n\u0131n 44+2 ciltlik matbu ansiklopedisi, ansiklopedinin elektronik versiyonu ve \u0130SAM Dok\u00fcmantasyon Veri Taban\u0131 taran\u0131p incelenerek ara\u015ft\u0131rmac\u0131lara kolayl\u0131k sa\u011flamak amac\u0131yla olu\u015fturulmu\u015f amat\u00f6r bir \u00e7al\u0131\u015fmadan ibarettir.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65062465, "asset_id": 44601011, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 62959916, "first_name": "\u0130lker", "last_name": "Ortayl\u0131", "domain_name": "ankara", "page_name": "\u0130lkerOrtayl\u0131", "display_name": "\u0130lker Ortayl\u0131", "profile_url": "https://ankara.academia.edu/%C4%B0lkerOrtayl%C4%B1?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/62959916/25853510/37872802/s65_i_lker.ortayl_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10099, "name": "History of Religions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Religions?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 303703, "name": "Dinler Tarihi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dinler_Tarihi?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1927041, "name": "The Encyclopedia of Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Encyclopedia_of_Islam?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3818714, "name": "Diyanet \u0130slam Ansiklopedisi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diyanet_%C4%B0slam_Ansiklopedisi?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44590577, "title": "A Weaver Named Kabir: Selected Verses with a Detailed Biographical and Historical Introduction by Charlotte Vaudeville  (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993)", "created_at": "2020-11-27T17:16:09.784-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44590577/A_Weaver_Named_Kabir_Selected_Verses_with_a_Detailed_Biographical_and_Historical_Introduction_by_Charlotte_Vaudeville_Oxford_Oxford_University_Press_1993_?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_44590577", "summary": "Kabir, we may think, needs no introduction.

In this paper, the relation between tasawwaf and struggle in the view of current socio-political scenario is discussed. The struggle of Amir Abdul Qadir Algeri is analysed as a Sufi, freedom fighter, statesman and reformer. Different tools of methodology are used: comparative method, internal and external criticism of different sources, and fusion of horizons for reliable findings. It is found that Amir Abdul Qadir Algeri was not only a Sufi or scholar fighting for his personal interest rather he was the man who not only defended his territories from imperial occupation but also resisted for a long time and established state and system. Modesty and broadness of thought of Amir Abdul Qadir and his behaviour to other religions earn the fame from all over the world not only as the leader of Muslims but also as the survivor of humanity without any religious discrimination.

He reveals the meaning of some ayats of Quran, that when Allah created Adam He commanded all the angels to worship Him because He created man as his Khalifah in the earth. Thus, according to Bahauddin, human must know the true essence of his place in this world. Human must know and act as the Khalifah of Allah on the earth, know all his adjectives and names, and created to display all of His mightiness and power. It is emphasized that man is the perfect creature that reflects himself the whole of universe, and to attain this perfection level, it must be an inseparable connection with the mighty and pure power of Allah. The work of \"Avrodi Naqshbandiya\" is a collection of psalms, names of Allah, zikr, glorification, ayats of Quran, salawat and duas which must regularly understand, comprehend contemplate and repeat with heart in order to be pleased by Allah.

'Abdul Razz\u0101q K\u0101sh\u0101n\u012b was the pioneer and forerunner of the debate, followed by reading and interpreting al-Shaykh al-Akbar's key texts, particularly Fus\u016bs al-Hikam (Bezels of Wisdom) by future generations of Sh\u012b'\u012b scholars. Along with commentaries and glosses on his works, every element of ibn 'Arab\u012b's mysticism, from his theory of the oneness of existence (wahdat al-wuj\u016bd) to his doctrines of nubuwwa, wil\u0101ya, and khatm al-wil\u0101ya, was accepted by his Sh\u012b'\u012b peers, incorporated into their context and adjusted to Sh\u012b'a doctrinal platform. This process of internalization and amalgamation was so complete that after seven centuries, it is difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish between Ibn 'Arab\u012b's theory of wahdat al-wuj\u016bd, or his doctrines of wil\u0101ya and khatm al-wil\u0101ya and those of his Sh\u012b'\u012b readers. To have a clearer picture of the philosophical and mystical activities and interests of Sh\u012b'\u012b scholars in Iran under Ilkhanids (1256-1353), I examined the intellectual and historical contexts of seventh century Iran. The findings of my research are indicative of the contribution of mystics such as \"Abdul Razz\u0101q K\u0101sh\u0101n\u012b to both the school of Ibn 'Arab\u012b in general and of Sadr al-D\u012bn al-Q\u016bnaw\u012b in particular on the one hand, and to the correlation between Sufism and Sh\u012b'\u012bsm on the other. What I call the Sh\u012b'\u012btization of Akbar\u012ban Mysticism' started with K\u0101sh\u0101n\u012b and can be regarded as a new chapter in the history of Iranian Sufism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64743560, "asset_id": 44350266, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 148395383, "first_name": "Jurnal", "last_name": "Teosofi", "domain_name": "uinsby", "page_name": "JurnalTeosofi", "display_name": "Jurnal Teosofi", "profile_url": "https://uinsby.academia.edu/JurnalTeosofi?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/148395383/40879174/36880245/s65_jurnal.teosofi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14584, "name": "Persianate Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persianate_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17240, "name": "Contemporary Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24788, "name": "Sufism in the West", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_in_the_West?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 28459, "name": "Tariqa Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tariqa_Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 30566, "name": "Science and Islamic Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_and_Islamic_Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 35080, "name": "Sufism in the Formative Period", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_in_the_Formative_Period?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 177375, "name": "Cosmopolitan Sufism & Religiosity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Sufism_and_Religiosity?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 193481, "name": "philosophical Sufism (school of Ibn 'Arabi)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/philosophical_Sufism_school_of_Ibn_Arabi_?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 307587, "name": "Sufisme", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufisme?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 344616, "name": "Early Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 647028, "name": "Sufism and Tasawwuf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_and_Tasawwuf?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 44340655, "title": "Social, Economic, and Psychological Problems of the People Visiting Shrines (A case study of Data Darbar, Shah Jamal and Mian Mir in Lahore", "created_at": "2020-10-21T02:59:44.558-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44340655/Social_Economic_and_Psychological_Problems_of_the_People_Visiting_Shrines_A_case_study_of_Data_Darbar_Shah_Jamal_and_Mian_Mir_in_Lahore?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_44340655", "summary": "Shrines are the places where usually people go for peace and tranquility.

"Hagiography/tadhkira is a sufi biographical compendium It is a conscious remembrance of sufis' lives along with the concerned cultural residue and reconstructions. It has also been termed as memorative communication. The Chishti hagiographies also stand for remembering the lineage, sufis of the Silsilah, their teachings and dealings, past heritage. They remember most of the sufis in the Silsilah, Chishti practices, kh\u0101nq\u0101h life, prayers and most importantly, social affairs of the time. The present study will deal with the very first hagiography in Indian and Chishti history, Siyar al-awliy\u0101. Written around 1350 by Am\u012br Khurd, who was a close disciple of Shaykh Nizam al-D\u012bn Awliy\u0101 (d. 1325). Its in-depth study explicit an operative gender ideology and a masculine coding that shapes the writer's narrative. In his work, women have been commemorated as briefly as the writer could. They are only observed as pious mothers, sisters and wives. Women in the hagiographical tradition of South Asia had no other roles to play except cooking and cleaning, which depicts that there is an underlying idea of denying the spiritual equality, importance of woman generally in society and particularly in the Silsilah. The reader never comes across a woman who could be attributed as sufi in this tadhkira. The study suggests that it has silenced the women's role not only in the sufi circles but in the medieval Indian legacy too, through this communicative remembrance. Men who surrender unto Allah, And women who surrender, And men who believe, And women who believe,", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64644747, "asset_id": 44268374, "asset_type": "Work",

constituted one of the most powerful drawcards to people embracing Islam. This book considers a broad range of questions relating to Sufism, including its history, manifestations in various countries and communities, its expression in poetry, women and Sufism, and expressions among popular spirituality. In addition, the volume challenges the long-held view of Sufism as being necessarily peaceful, through a consideration in one paper of Sufis engaging in violent Jihad. The book works at the interface between the scholarly and the practical, using rigorous methodology to ensure that its findings are reliable, while also giving attention to how Sufi thinking impacts the daily lives of Sufis. This represents an original and important dimension of this study, given the significant role played by Sufis throughout Islamic history in enriching discussion of intellectual and charismatic questions, as well as informing popular practice among \"Folk\" Muslims.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 87885209, "asset_id": 44081756, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2288625, "first_name": "Professor Peter", "last_name": "Riddell", "domain_name": "actheology", "page_name": "ProfessorPeterRiddell", "display_name": "Professor Peter G Riddell", "profile_url": "https://actheology.academia.edu/ProfessorPeterRiddell?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2288625/1037595/13667572/s65_prof_peter.riddell.jpg"}, {"id": 50239545, "first_name": "Dr Ruth", "last_name": "Nicholls", "domain_name": "melbschooltheol", "page_name": "DrRuthNicholls", "display_name": "Dr Ruth Nicholls", "profile_url": "https://melbschooltheol.academia.edu/DrRuthNicholls?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/50239545/22493297/21691610/s65_dr_ruth.nicholls.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 43908798, "title": "\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0628\u0644\u0627 \u0634\u064a\u0621: \u0623\u0648 \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0648\u0642\u0650\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0651\u064e\u0631\u064a\u0651-\u0634\u0641\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0648\u0639\u064a\u0644", "created_at": "2020-08-20T18:20:24.468-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43908798/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9_%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%A7_%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%A1_%D8%A3%D9%88_%D8%B9%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%A7_%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%82%D9%90%D9%81_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%81%D9%8E%D9%91%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%91_%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A9_%D9%88%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%84?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_43908798", "summary": "Writing is an existential concept in al-Niffar\u012b's Sufi experience, where waqfa-or standing on the ontological \u1e6dalal (ruin) before God-is the aporia of alienation and esoteric dispersion in the journey of knowledge.

Far from an exhaustive survey of any sort, what I have attempted instead is a preliminary and necessarily partial outline of the intellectual trajectory of Qur\u2019an commentaries and translations in the South Asian context\u2014in Arabic, Persian, and Urdu\u2014with a view to exploring how shifting historical and political conditions informed new ways of engaging the Qur\u2019an. My central argument is this: in South Asia, the early modern and modern\nperiods saw an important shift from largely elite scholarship on the Qur\u2019an, invariably conducted by scholars intimately bound to the imperial order of their time, to more self-consciously popular works of translation and exegesis designed to access and attract a wider non-elite public. In this shift, I argue, translation itself emerged as an important and powerful medium of hermeneutical populism pregnant with the promise of broadening the boundaries of the Qur\u2019an\u2019s readership and understanding. In other words, as the pendulum of political sovereignty gradually shifted from pre-colonial Islamicate imperial orders to British colonialism, new ways of imagining the role, function, and accessibility of the Qur\u2019an also came into central view. A major emphasis of this essay is on the thought and contributions of the hugely influential eighteenth-century scholar Shah Wali Ullah (d. 1762) and his family on the intellectual topography of South Asian Qur\u2019an commentaries\nand translations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63921281, "asset_id": 43620554, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 226860, "first_name": "Sherali", "last_name": "Tareen", "domain_name": "fandm", "page_name": "SheraliTareen", "display_name": "Sherali Tareen", "profile_url": "https://fandm.academia.edu/SheraliTareen?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/226860/1960186/17527716/s65_sherali.tareen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6869, "name": "Qur'anic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Quranic_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 43612673, "title": "Interpretation and Overinterpretation of Ja'far Ibn Hasan Al-Barzanji's Mawlid Al-Barzanji Fadlil Munawwar Mansur", "created_at": "2020-07-14T02:38:10.986-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43612673/Interpretation_and_Overinterpretation_of_Jafar_Ibn_Hasan_Al_Barzanjis_Mawlid_Al_Barzanji_Fadlil_Munawwar_Mansur?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_43612673", "summary": "This article examines the use of interpretation and overinterpretation in understanding Ja'far ibn Hasan al-Barzanji's text, Mawlid al-Barzanji, one of the religious literatures in Indonesia. The results of the study indicate that Mawlid Al-Barzanji which contain majesty, miracles, prayer, and profound love for the Prophet is widely responded by Indonesian Muslims through the process of reading, interpretation, and appreciation. Such widespread acceptance is due to the fulfillment of interpretation requirements which requires the existence of a common world view between author and reader or interpreter. On the other hand, overinterpretation occurs when the text of Mawlid Al-Barzanji is interpreted by those who have different world views as a result of different religious ideas and religious ideologies. Such overinterpretation invites negative response, ideological prejudice, and rejection of some parts of Al-Barzanji text by those who identify themselves as a salafi group.",

These rules, though varying with the demands of time, have been incorporated into human life to ensure harmony and prosperity. Of particular significance are the moral or ethical rules that have guided humanity along the path of goodness. Moral codes of conduct have always been tied to the idea of right and wrong, of goodness and evil, and are almost always introduced with religious or cultural undertones. While this may be the cause for differences in certain specific codes of conduct across different cultures and religions, nonetheless, there are also pieces of evidence pointing to a universal nature of moral and ethical values. There are some of these values that remain the same across cultures, and religions are causes for exploration. Therefore, the current paper seeks to explore the similarities in ethical or moral values and behavior found in religious scriptures, namely Futuwwat-nama and certain Hindu scriptures. Moreover, the paper briefly examines modern psychological theories to understand morality through religion. For this purpose, we have examined Muhammad ibn al-Husayn al-Sulami's Futuwwat-nama, 'The Book of Sufi Chivalry,' and some Hindu scriptures, such as the 'Rig Veda', 'Manu Smrithi' and 'Mahabharata' to name a few.

An old version, still cited widely in public discussions, is that Sufis were originally the \"peaceful\" outsiders who accompanied military adventurers arriving into the Indian sub-continent from Iran and Central Asia from the fifth/eleventh century onward. Exhibiting exemplary piety and possessed of proselytizing zeal, these individuals are supposed to have attracted local inhabitants to Islam. This view has been critiqued convincingly by recent historians for being based on a simplis-tic understanding of socioreligious factors plausible for explaining change in religious affiliation. It has been replaced by theories that emphasize \"conver-sion\" as a lengthy community-based process that varies greatly depending on the types of religious communities that existed in different parts of India before the arrival of Muslims. In this version, the growth of Muslim populations is linked also to socioeconomic considerations such as agrarian expansion, deforestation , and evolution of networks spread across regions and oceans. Charismatic Sufis do still matter in the more complicated understanding of how Muslims communities developed in South Asia. But in this instance, it is their dead bodies, and the stories told about them posthumously, that are seen as more important than their origins or what they may have said or done when they were alive. Interred in shrines controlled by descendants and other successors, these Sufis became nodes in pilgrimage circuits and were woven into community narratives. The shrines also received patronage from political elites seeking legitimacy, their caretakers often mediating between populations surrounding the shrines and rulers in urban centers located at a distance. Among other compelling attributes, recent historiographical interventions regarding the significance of Sufis are able to account for the great variance between regions of India when it comes to the expansion of Mus-lim communities. Local social and ecological factors explain, for example, why territories that today comprise Bangladesh and Pakistan are majority Muslim, while the area around Delhi, where Muslim dynasties were centered for many centuries, is not.

"summary": "Syed Mehr Ali Shah was the famous Muslim scholar of British India. He is known to have rendered invaluable services to the true cause of true Islam at that time of British Raj. The rise and ascendency of west and fall of Muslims in political, economic and intellectual fields led them to many religious problems and issues too. It was during t his period of adversity for the Muslims of Indo-Pak that, with the socio-political tactic of the then British Government of India, there arose many dissentions and vitiations like Shirk, Bid'ah and refusal of the finality of the Prophet-hood. He actively guided the Muslims to believe in the absolute oneness of Allah as Allah alone is entitled to Man's worship and adoration and in the Prophet-hood of Muhammad particularly its finality for all time to come constitute the two basic credence of Islam. He not only addressed all these issues but also advised the Muslims of Indo-Pak to stick to the teachings of Quran and Hadith. In this article the role of Syed Mehr Ali Shah for correcting the beliefs and deeds of the Muslim society of the Indo-Pak have been discussed and his efforts specially reforming the belief of Tawh\u012bd, finality of the Prophet-hood of Muhammad, and misconceptions about other beliefs and difference between Sunnah and Bid'ah have been focused. In the perspective of the current situation faced by our country, it is quite necessary for our society to seek guidance from the teachings of the Syed Mehr Ali Shah to solve the differences between masses and reforming the beliefs and deeds mistakenly adopted by our society by the influence of West and illiterate spiritualists.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63122127, "asset_id": 42879746, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 140518143, "first_name": "Dr. Allah Ditta", "last_name": "Qadri", "domain_name": "bzu", "page_name": "AllahDittaBaluch", "display_name": "Dr. Allah Ditta Qadri", "profile_url": "https://bzu.academia.edu/AllahDittaBaluch?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/140518143/37888679/34593169/s65_allah_ditta.baluch.jpg"}, {"id": 157463984, "first_name": "Hassan", "last_name": "Mahmood", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HassanMahmood67", "display_name": "Hassan Mahmood", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HassanMahmood67?f_ri=17239", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1253048, "name": "Islamic Beliefs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Beliefs?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1414090, "name": "Indo-Pak", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indo-Pak?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3636518, "name": "Mehr Ali Shah", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mehr_Ali_Shah?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 42638668, "title": "Social and Economic Contribution of Kubraviya Sufi Order in Kashmir Islamic Studies", "created_at": "2020-04-06T03:06:08.803-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42638668/Social_and_Economic_Contribution_of_Kubraviya_Sufi_Order_in_Kashmir_Islamic_Studies?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_42638668", "summary": "There are so many definitions of Sufism given by different scholars, the definition of Sufism given by Sufis is the word of Hadith-e-Jibreel that is \u201cIhsaan\u201d which means doing worship of God in such a way that you are seeing Him, if not so then God is seeing you. Here I have chosen the another definition given by Qudratullah Shahab in his travelogue \u201cShahabnamah\u201d which I think is the meticulous definition of Sufism, is that; Islam is just an institution and Sufism is the kindergarten of Islam.\n\nAfter studying the basics of Sufism I have come to the point that Sufism is a method by which we can understand Islam, we can practice Islam, and we can preach Islam.\n\nThere are four main Sufi orders that is, Qadriyah Sufi order, Chistiyah Sufi order, Suharwardiyah Sufi order and Naqashbandiyah Sufi order. There are also number of sub Sufi orders and one of them is Kubraviya Sufi order which is actually the offshoot of Suharwardiyah Sufi order.\n\nAmong the Sufi orders introduced in Kashmir the Kubraviya order gained the most popularity. It was founded by Ahamad Bin Umar-ul-Khayuqi, popularly known as Najmuddin Kubra born in Khwarazm in 1145 AD. Syed Ali Hamadani, (introduced the Kubbraviya Sufi order in Kashmir), in 1374 AD.\n\nHe was linked with that order through Raziuddin Ali Lala. Raziuddin, after travelling to a number of Muslim countries, had settled in Turkistan, in the monastery (Khanqah) of Sheikh Ahmad Yasu. He came in contact with Najmuddin Kubra at Khwarazm and became his disciple.\n\nSufis of Kubbraviya order were very influential in introducing Islam in Kashmir and have had a major hand in shaping the culture of Kashmir. Syed Ali Hamadani and his 6 followers played a vital role in boosting the economy of Kashmir. Among the followers who accompanied him to Kashmir were men of arts and crafts who flourished in the valley of Kashmir. They popularized shawl making, carpet manufacturing, cloth weaving, paper machie, pottery and calligraphy etc. The skills and knowhow he brought to Kashmir gave rise to an industry which is world famous even now as the home of Kashmiri Shawls.\n\nM S Wadoo a nature writer, writes in his book \u201cTrees of our Heritage\u201d that \u201cthe maple (chinar) tree at the garden of Sufi saint Syed Qasim Shah at Chattergam in Budgam district of Kashmir is 31.85 meters of circumference and its height is 14.78 meters\u201d. As per his reports the tree was planted in 1374 AD by Syed Qasim who accompanied Syed Ali Hamadani from Iran to Kashmir.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62844128, "asset_id": 42638668, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 152757643, "first_name": "Mateen", "last_name": "Tahir", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MateenTahir2", "display_name": "Mateen Tahir", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MateenTahir2?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/152757643/42477051/56145802/s65_mateen.tahir.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 42580902, "title": "The Sherpas across The Eastern Himalayas (Testing of Space and Time, c. 1870s-2000) By Anjashi Sarkar", "created_at": "2020-04-02T22:35:12.697-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42580902/The_Sherpas_across_The_Eastern_Himalayas_Testing_of_Space_and_Time_c_1870s_2000_By_Anjashi_Sarkar?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_42580902", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62816374, "asset_id": 42580902, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 758829, "first_name": "Niloy", "last_name": "Biswas", "domain_name": "dhakauniversity", "page_name": "NiloyBiswas", "display_name": "Niloy Biswas", "profile_url": "https://dhakauniversity.academia.edu/NiloyBiswas?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/758829/1168673/34017572/s65_niloy.biswas.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 78685, "name": "Mountaineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mountaineering?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 617564, "name": "Sherpa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sherpa?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 42438928, "title": "Movement and Stillness: The Practice of Sufi Dhikr in Fourteenth-Century Central Asia - Shahzad Bashir Stanford University", "created_at": "2020-03-31T04:26:48.864-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42438928/Movement_and_Stillness_The_Practice_of_Sufi_Dhikr_in_Fourteenth_Century_Central_Asia_Shahzad_Bashir_Stanford_University?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_42438928", "summary": "In questo lavoro, Shahzad Bashir sostiene che la pratica Sufi del dhikr presuppone un continuum tra mente e corpo, e tra l'individuo e il suo ambiente sociale, in particolare il suo Maestro.

Although in the aftermath of partition they have perpetually been living under severe constraints and facing very unsuitable and hard times, however they are coping with the situations and slowly progressing ahead. As far as their contribution to Islamic studies is concerned, they have done very well in some areas and their achievement was very remarkable especially in Sirah writing, Hadis legacy and ,Fiqh literature etc. Along with Muslim men there are some Muslim women too, who made considerable contribution in deferent fields related to Islamic studies. Muslim women scholars' contribution in this area ,though was limited, however a few of women scholars did marvellous things in different areas related to Islam and Muslims. A few name are shining models in this arena, for example Dr. Zeenat Shoukat Ali director general of The World Institute of Islamic Studies for Dialogue and Organization of Mediation and Gender Justice (Wisdom Foundation) and professor Farida Khanam an ex faculty member in the department of Islamic studies Jamia Millia Islamia New Delhi and a noted writer and Dawa activist. Both of them are distinguished and prolific writers. They generally write on problems faced by Muslim women, women rights in Islam, Muslim women's historical contribution, gender equality, women education and related issues. Both are public speakers and active in building peace, communal harmony and interfaith dialogue. To their credit both of them have several books, research papers and monologues. In this humble paper I shall try to shed lights on both these Muslim women's academic activities , scholarly work with evaluation of their views and approaches.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61865969, "asset_id": 41707255, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6496942, "first_name": "Muhammad", "last_name": "Ghitreef", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MuhammadGhitreef", "display_name": "Muhammad Ghitreef", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MuhammadGhitreef?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6496942/2640193/3069814/s65_muhammad.ghitreef.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 36717, "name": "Contemporary Islamic Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Islamic_Thought?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 41489241, "title": "Freedom of Religion, Faith and Religious Tolerance in Bangladesh: A Case Study on the Islamic Mysticism", "created_at": "2020-01-02T02:35:28.031-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41489241/Freedom_of_Religion_Faith_and_Religious_Tolerance_in_Bangladesh_A_Case_Study_on_the_Islamic_Mysticism?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_41489241", "summary": "A common concept in Bangladesh is that religious communities live together in peaceful coexistence, and this culture has come from ancient times. Generally, Bangladesh is a Muslim country with a majority in Islam. But, according to the constitution of Bangladesh, all citizens have equal rights regardless of religion. There are 169 million people in Bangladesh. There is about 90 percent of Bangladesh's population is Muslim, 9.5 percent of the people depend on Hindu religion, 0.6 percent of people belong to Buddhists religion, 0.3 percent are Christians. It has less than one percent is Ahmadi Muslims and Shi\u2019ite as well. Every religion of People gets vacations for their celebrating on national holidays according to the constitution of Bangladesh. There is evidence of celebrating various religious ceremonies and festivals. There is all public participation in religious programs and festivals like Eid Ul Fitr and Eid Ul Azha for Muslims, Durga Puja for Hindus, Buddha Purnima for Buddhists and Christmas for Christians. It is a significant achievement in the country of such a religious majority. In similar circumstances, there is no such kind of behavior in Bangladesh with respect to religious diversity in other parts of the world. The common masses of Bangladesh deserve praise for this achievement. In the country's constitution, there has been an assurance of all religions, which serves as a protector against intolerance. Bangladesh is recognized as a tolerant society for all these reasons. Religious intolerance and extremism are not yet common in Bangladesh society. Unfortunately, this is not the case in other parts of the world. The world's advanced continents like America and Europe, religious intolerance exists as well as there is widespread discrimination against Muslim men and women. To prevent Muslims from praying in the mosque, Muslim women were prevented from wearing the hijab and scarf as well. Even Muslims are not given vacation on the day of Eid festivals every year. Thus, the countries which were considered the ideal of tolerance could not be endurable like Bangladesh. The Religious communities in Bangladesh are the main reason for peaceful coexistence and religious tolerance: the great influence of Islamic Mysticism, Bengali Unity, and Bengali language as well. However, Islamic Mysticism in Bangladesh depends directly on the beliefs, history, and culture of the Bangla-deshi Muslims. Islamic Mysticism contributed to reducing the religious hatred, fanaticism, and fundamentalism among the people of Bangladesh. Therefore, the result of my study shows that how to Islamic Mysticism is establishing status equality, love, and brotherhood among the masses and taught people to respect each other's religion, emotions, and practices in Bangladesh. The research tries to highlight that the influence of Islamic Mysticism was investigated to promote religious cohesion and tolerance in Bangladesh from the 11th to the 21st century.\n\nKeywords: Ahl al-Hadith, Ahl al-Qur\u2019an, Indian sub-continent, religion, sect.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61659364, "asset_id": 41489241, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 56525567, "first_name": "Saeyd Rashed Hasan", "last_name": "Chowdury", "domain_name": "ankara", "page_name": "RashedHasanChowdury", "display_name": "Saeyd Rashed Hasan Chowdury", "profile_url": "https://ankara.academia.edu/RashedHasanChowdury?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/56525567/14866831/32036394/s65_saeyd_rashed_hasan.chowdury.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7322, "name": "Mysticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mysticism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12344, "name": "Comparative Mysticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Mysticism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17240, "name": "Contemporary Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28418, "name": "Tariqats", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tariqats?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 28459, "name": "Tariqa Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tariqa_Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 30571, "name": "Islamic Mysticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Mysticism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 35080, "name": "Sufism in the Formative Period", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_in_the_Formative_Period?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 154945, "name": "Islamic intellectual history, medieval political thought,Islamic philosophy and mysticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_intellectual_history_medieval_political_thought_Islamic_philosophy_and_mysticism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 177375, "name": "Cosmopolitan Sufism & Religiosity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Sufism_and_Religiosity?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 193481, "name": "philosophical Sufism (school of Ibn 'Arabi)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/philosophical_Sufism_school_of_Ibn_Arabi_?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 970822, "name": "Sufism In Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_In_Bangladesh?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 1140508, "name": "Mysticism and Sprituality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mysticism_and_Sprituality?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 1834642, "name": "Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 41423647, "title": "Soul of A Woman Was Created Below", "created_at": "2019-12-25T12:29:04.634-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41423647/Soul_of_A_Woman_Was_Created_Below?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_41423647", "summary": "Although apologists for Islam often claim that the status of women in Mus\u00adlim societies is \"separate but equal,\" this has rarely been the case in practice. Despite Qur'anic depictions of women as spiritually equal to men, medieval Islamic writings often portrayed woman as the embodiment of the lower hu\u00adman soul (al-nafs) or even the animal soul (al-nafs al-hayawaniyya). This negative portrayal of woman migrated from religious and philosophical texts to the popular imagination. In the Qur'an, the nafs is ambivalent in nature and its faults are not linked specifically to women. However, in the hadith, the nafs is portrayed negatively and women are depicted as lacking the reason (' aql) to control the defects of the soul. Such portrayals led to later literary depictions of women as susceptible to evil. The portrayal of woman as the em\u00adbodiment of the lower and animal souls was a common theme in philosophical and Sufi writings. In modern times, these Sufi and philosophical depictions developed into a misogynistic stereotype that linked the evil of woman to her animalistic nature. The sacralization of woman's evil and inferiority to men in extra-Qur'anic religious writings has played an important cultural role in denying woman equal status in many Muslim societies.

Throughout the research several theories have been related to the  aspects of the shrine practices in this area as the socio-economic scenario  have been thought through; also, the paper is more about the connection  between this specific shrine practices and the beliefs and history of  people around the shrine who are the powerhouse of this and the impact  of the background.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61405152, "asset_id": 41163829, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 88081082, "first_name": "Rash-ha", "last_name": "Muntaqaa", "domain_name": "ut-ee", "page_name": "RashhaMuntaqaa", "display_name": "Rash-ha Muntaqaa", "profile_url": "https://ut-ee.academia.edu/RashhaMuntaqaa?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/88081082/20169786/46168643/s65_rash-ha.muntaqaa.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 256645, "name": "ETHNO-THEOLGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ETHNO-THEOLGY_AND_ETHNOMEDICINE?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 41054098, "title": "Sufi Text, Genre and the Problem of Classification: A Study of Amir Khurd Kirmani\u2019s Siyar al-auliya", "created_at": "2019-11-25T00:21:00.369-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41054098/Sufi_Text_Genre_and_the_Problem_of_Classification_A_Study_of_Amir_Khurd_Kirmani_s_Siyar_al_auliya?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_41054098", "summary": "Sufi literature occupies a significant place in the literary and religio-spiritual history of medieval India. This sufi literature is categorised in varied genres ranging from tadhkirah to malfuzat. However, it is noteworthy to mention that many of the early sufi texts were hybrid, thus defying any neat categorisation as per present-day literary standards. The study of a fourteenth-century sufi text, Siyar al-auliya' dar ahval-o malfuzat-i mashayikh-i Chisht, authored by Amir Khurd Kirmani (d. 1368-69 CE) reveals such problematic categorisation of medieval writings. The title of this fourteenth-century sufi text, composed between 1351-1368 CE in north India, also reflects this problem. It is classified sometimes as tadhkirah or a memoir, or a malfuz or a collection of conversations of the Sufis of silsilah-i Chishtiyyah-Nizamiyyah, and partly considered a sufi manual on sufi ethics and doctrines. Nonetheless, it is considered the very first work of its kind. The present study is an attempt to assess and analyse all the categories of genres assigned to this hybrid text. It argues that Siyar al-auliya' is primarily a tadhkirah since the bulk of its content deals with sufi biographies, whereas only a small part of it contains the malfuzat or the sayings and conversations of Shaykh Nizam al-Din Auliya'. Moreover, it may be considered a \"proto-tadhkirah\" since the tadhkirah-writing tradition was in its nascent phase, and yet was not fully developed in South Asia compared to other parts of the Muslim world. That is why, it included non-biographical material as well.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61326203, "asset_id": 41054098, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9027805, "first_name": "Tanvir", "last_name": "Anjum", "domain_name": "qau", "page_name": "TanvirAnjum", "display_name": "Tanvir Anjum", "profile_url": "https://qau.academia.edu/TanvirAnjum?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9027805/3012440/3726097/s65_tanvir.anjum.jpg"}, {"id": 13136703, "first_name": "adeela", "last_name": "Ghazanfar", "domain_name": "qau", "page_name": "adeelaGhazanfar", "display_name": "adeela Ghazanfar", "profile_url": "https://qau.academia.edu/adeelaGhazanfar?f_ri=17239", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14584, "name": "Persianate Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persianate_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 307587, "name": "Sufisme", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufisme?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 323846, "name": "Islamic Sufi Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Sufi_Literature?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 647028, "name": "Sufism and Tasawwuf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_and_Tasawwuf?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 41007259, "title": "Ghum Charkha\u1e5by\u0101/Spin, O Spinning-wheel: Cotton-spinning and Weaving Symbolism in Shah Husayn's Poetry", "created_at": "2019-11-21T03:36:44.606-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41007259/Ghum_Charkha%E1%B9%9By%C4%81_Spin_O_Spinning_wheel_Cotton_spinning_and_Weaving_Symbolism_in_Shah_Husayns_Poetry?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_41007259", "summary": "Shah Husayn (1539-1593) of Lahore, popularly known as Lal Husayn, is a celebrated sixteenth-century sufi poet of premodern Punjab, who composed very lyrical and melodious short poems or k\u0101f\u012bs. His poetical compositions are high symbolic in nature, with similes and metaphors drawn from Punjabi rural life and folk traditions. In particular, most of his metaphors are related to cotton-spinning and cloth weaving, cotton being a major agricultural produce of Punjab. One of the reasons is that Shah Husayn belonged to a family or caste of weavers, which was, and is still, considered a marginalized community in South Asia. He was not shamed of his social status, as he did not hesitate to openly acknowledge it in his poetry. Most of his famous k\u0101fis feature spinning and weaving metaphors, with charkha or the spinning-wheel as the central symbol. He employed a feminine voice in his poetry. He also talked about the technicalities of spinning and weaving, as well as attan or the female social space for spinning, and dowry, and beautifully weaves them in his sufi symbolism, which is meant to disseminate ethical ideals among the readers. He urges the people to earn good deeds during their lifetime so that they could enjoy the eternal pleasures in the life hereafter.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61288139, "asset_id": 41007259, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6012620, "first_name": "naila", "last_name": "pervaiz", "domain_name": "gcu-pk", "page_name": "nailapervaiz", "display_name": "naila pervaiz", "profile_url": "https://gcu-pk.academia.edu/nailapervaiz?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6012620/2916739/12112554/s65_naila.pervaiz.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 17241, "name": "Sufi Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufi_Poetry?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611781, "name": "Punjabi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Punjabi?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 40969418, "title": "The Light November 2019", "created_at": "2019-11-18T04:02:53.577-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40969418/The_Light_November_2019?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_40969418", "summary": "The English monthly journal of the Ahmadiyya Anjuman Ishaat Islam of Lahore.

Bauls or the Bauls may signify a heterogeneous community; a particular type of folk song; unusual religious and mystical practices so on and so forth. Previous sentence does not make it clear whether to call them Bauls or the Bauls. So let us understand the difference between Baul and the Baul. What actually matters is the use of definite article \u2018the\u2019 which creates huge difference. You may say \u2018the Baul\u2019 which could vaguely mean the perennial community of performers and \u2018Baul\u2019 without \u2018the\u2019 may mean songs which the Bauls sing.

Just like the Magh songs and singers of Himachal Pradesh, Jangams of Haryana, Golla Kalapam art of Andhra Pradesh, Bangari art of Hyderabad, Barahmasi of Chattisgarh and even the English ballads, Baul songs are transmitted through oral tradition. Bauls invoke their Divine Beloved by calling Him Allah, Ahad (the One), Monar Manush (the Man of Heart), Sahaj Manush (the Natural Man); Sonar Manush (the golden Person); Adhar Manush (the intangible Beloved); Acin Pakhi (the unknown Bird);  Shai/Sai (the Lord), Krishna so on and so forth.\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60868603, "asset_id": 40588683, "asset_type": "Work",

Building my critique primarily on the scholarly work of H.T.Sorley, I argue that in an attempt to construct the Sufi image of \u2018Sindhi nation\u2019, the Progressives undermine the casteist, fatalist and sectarian import of Latif\u2019s poetry and life-history.  Latif\u2019s heterodox and multivocal nature of poetry and ambiguity regarding the originality of his verses gives expression to multiple and contradictory signifiers, including the casteist ones. This heterodoxy of Latif allows the Progressives, like any other social and political group, to legitimize and popularize the selective verses that may have, at least on surface, the egalitarian and patriotic import, to exonerate Latif from any possible hegemonic impact of the casteist values and the Ashrafia privileges that he enjoyed in his times, or the Progressives themselves continue to enjoy.

In recent years, academic interest has geared towards the investigation of sufi women's collective and ritualistic performance within structured sufi circles. Henceforth, this paper explores ways in which the gathering of sufi women of Boutchichiyya, a Morocco-based sufi order, in a zawiya mediates not only ritual performances but also promotes the rehearsal of sociability and social relations. The point is made that within a horizon that is viewed as a nexus where the ritualistic performance is what matters in a zawiya, sufi women's gathering is characterized by a sense of community, and interconnections between spiritual, social capital and socialization. In this 'pri-blic' (private and public) space, namely the zawiya, sufi women of Boutchichiyya enjoy privacy and communal life. Knowing that the zawiya is a segregated space, since men and women disciples perform rituals separately, one might surmise that the spatial division sparks gender inequality. However, this spatial segregation is an ideal of emancipation, which subsumes a spatial segregation of rituals, and constructs a realm of privacy, intimacy, and fervent ambiance women aspire to.This paper builds on findings of a qualitative ethnographic research, in which the researcher assumed a participant-observer role to generate a more focused discussion on whether the gender division of space highlights women's spirituality or undermines it. More precisely, this paper approaches the interactive relationship, which engages women's sufi experience with prevalent spatial politics in Moroccan society. In such a space where women come to learn and imbibe spiritual knowledge, social relationships are important assets for women's spiritual, social, and personal growth.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60550477, "asset_id": 40309196, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 42467771, "first_name": "Sarah", "last_name": "Hebbouch", "domain_name": "ensrabat", "page_name": "sarahhebbouch", "display_name": "Sarah Hebbouch", "profile_url": "https://ensrabat.academia.edu/sarahhebbouch?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/42467771/12852495/39407535/s65_sarah.hebbouch.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 17240, "name": "Contemporary Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 35085, "name": "Pious and/or Sufi Women", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pious_and_or_Sufi_Women?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1263896, "name": "Sufi Women Morocco", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufi_Women_Morocco?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 40150112, "title": "SPIRITUAL HIJR OF THE SUFIS", "created_at": "2019-08-22T17:44:51.652-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40150112/SPIRITUAL_HIJR_OF_THE_SUFIS?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_40150112", "summary": "Sufism or tassawuf where described as one of \"the soft face of Islam\" are groups of people that tend to develop an old Islamic lifestyle and interested to zuhud movement (away from worldly things).

The earliest Sufis attempted at Islamic conversion began in the very hostile environment maintained by the local Hindu or Buddhist rulers. However, these Sufis sheikhs or pirs were able to convert most of the local population to Islam by preaching about the great teachings of the new religion about love, brotherhood, and equality. Among other success factors in the Sufi mission in Islamic conversion of the Bengali during the period under discussion were their unconquerable dedication and exceptional piety as well as the common belief among the Bengali people that these pirs could perform incontestable miracles.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58442499, "asset_id": 38386257, "asset_type": "Work",

In other words it is understood that these ideas were transferred from foreign countries rather than from the internal dynamics of Yemen. Although the number of incoming dervishes was low, the level of influencing the region was high and the ideas of these mystics have been widely accepted in this region, especially in the eighth and ninth Hijri centuries. However, the unexpected expansion thoughts of Ibn al-Arab\u012b disturbed the madrasa scholars in Yemen. Especially Islamic law scholars have criticized the followers of Ibn al-Arab\u012b in Yemen from time to time. These scholars wrote reviews on the Ibn al-Arab\u012b school and against the dervishes who defended this school. Another \u1e62\u016bf\u012b  scholar coming from Yemen to another country, made great contributions in defending the idea of Ibn al-Arab\u012b against the criticism of law scholars in Yemen. This person is none other than Mad\u0332j\u0332d al-Din al-F\u012br\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d\u012b (d. 817/1415), who is known for his superb lexicological accumulation. During this period Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl b. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm al-Jabart\u012b was the leader of the \u1e62\u016bf\u012bs. There is a close connection between al-F\u012br\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d\u012b and al-Jabart\u012b. The Jabart\u012b madrasa spread works of Ibn al-Arab\u012b and al-F\u012br\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d\u012b. This situation had a big impact in Yemen. When these books spread through the Jabart\u012b madrasa, madrasa scholars began to criticize \u1e62\u016bf\u012bs especially about the wahdat al-wujud that adopting the school of Ibn al-Arab\u012b. So sometimes in order to stop this conflict, the sultan of that period had to take action. In order to deny the thought of Ibn al-Arab\u012b and refute his opinions, many madrasa scholars wrote books. This article examines another unknown aspect of an Islamic jurist al-F\u012br\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d\u012b as defender of Ibn al-Arab\u012b who came to Yemen from abroad.

How does the presence of many native European converts affect local Sufi communities? How do these European converts view Islamic normative tradition and express their religious identity? And how do they influence the defining discourses of local Sufi communities?\nI will particularly address intrareligious conversion, regarded here as a\nprocess of religious learning and gradual adoption of religious norms and\npractices in Sufi communities.

"summary": "The manuscript at-Tuhfah al-Mursalah as a track record of the past is full of virtues. Seeking virtue means preparing yourself through the purification process. Sufism, as a purification step to reach the Most Holy One. The spiritual experience gained by Salik when meeting and union with God (individual-transcendental values) should be felt also by others. The transmission of spiritual experience is implemented in empirical life (socio-empirical values) as a form of practicing and teaching the teachings of a loving Islam, so that the concept of rahmatan lil 'alamin can be felt by all creatures. The process of attaining the maqam requires clarity of heart; peace of mind, mind and environment; as well as sincerity amaliyah. Awareness to negate the existence of self ('alam nasut) and purify the existence of divinity ('alam lahut) in self as a form of preparation to accept the holiness of the Khaliq. It is this doctrine of purity that should be practiced and spread by the salik and perceived by all beings to create goodness in the universe.Goodness that does not look to ethnic, religious, ethnic, and state boundaries.Universal goodness as the real essence of Islam rahmatan lil a'lamin Abstrak Naskah at-Tuhfah al-Mursalah sebagai rekam jejak masa lalu yang sarat akan nilai kebajikan. Mencari kabajikan berarti menyiapkan diri melalui proses penyucian. Tasawuf, sebagai langkah menyucikan diri untuk mencapai Sang Maha Suci. Pengalaman spiritual yang didapatkan oleh salik ketika berjumpa dan bersatu diri dengan Tuhan (nilai-nilai individual-transedental) hendaknya dirasakan juga oleh yang lain. Penularan pengalaman spiritual diimplementasikan dalam kehidupan empirik (nilai-nilai sosio-empirik) sebagai bentuk pengamalan dan pengajaran ajaran islam yang penuh cinta kasih, sehingga konsep rahmatan lil 'alamin dapat dirasakan oleh segenap makhluk. Proses untuk mencapai maqam tersebut membutuhkan kejernihan hati; ketenangan jiwa, pikiran, dan lingkungan; serta kesungguhan amaliyah. Kesadaran untuk menegasikan eksistensi diri (alam nasut) dan menyucikan eksistensi ketuhanan (alam lahut) dalam diri sebagai bentuk persiapan menerima kesucian Sang Khaliq. Ajaran kesucian ini lah yang hendaknya diamalkan dan ditebarkan oleh salik serta dirasakan oleh seluruh makhluk sehingga tercipta kebaikan di semesta alam. Kebaikan yang tidak memandang suku, agama, etnis, dan batas negara. Kebaikan universal sebagai hakikat nyata Islam rahmatan lil a'lamin.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57708539, "asset_id": 37716048, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 63846490, "first_name": "Sadudin", "last_name": "Isan", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SadudinIsan", "display_name": "Sadudin Isan", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SadudinIsan?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/63846490/16992823/17188529/s65_sadudin.isan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 103198, "name": "Islamic thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_thought?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 426208, "name": "Filology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Filology?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 735672, "name": "Arabic Language and Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arabic_Language_and_Literature?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37702705, "title": "Review of Seyyed Hossein Nasr and Mehdi Aminrazavi (eds.), An Anthology of Philosophy in Persia, Volume 5: From the School of Illumination to Philosophical Mysticism.

It is well-known for the fact that it constructs Sufi terminology around the idea of the of the perfect man. Since the XIVth century, it has been translated and commented upon, and become widely read in the Indian and Ottoman cultural geographies. These texts, which reflect sensitivities of the sufi orders rather than indicating accumulation of theoretical reflection, are quite flexible in their conceptual paradigm. Furthermore, one may trace, up to the earlier periods, objections against attribution of al-Ghawthiyya to \u2018Abd al-Q\u0101dir J\u012bl\u0101n\u012b. These objections seem to be mostly related to the concept of the shath and they resulted in emergence of various polemical debates in XIXth century.

Sculpting my masterpiece \"The New Being\" is the case study for this analysis. In keeping with the theme of this issue of Int\u00e9grit\u00e9, the general focus is: What can the creative process teach us about God? The thesis is that the creative process is an effective way to negotiate oppositions for the purposes of psychological and/or spiritual growth and mastery, which shines a light on the important theme of opposition and growth in the stories of the Bible. This theme highlights the Biblical nature of creativity, that it is through adversity that God creates the universe, his nation Israel, and now, accomplishes his supreme task of re-creation or salvation, which he promises will manifest his kingdom by creating a new world culture that advances integral human development, a \u201cnew humanity\u201d in a \u201cnew creation.\u201d",

(scholar), who was also a sufi. The text is frequently cited as the earliest, most comprehensive and reliable biographical compilation of South Asian sufis and 'ulama\u0304' from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century. I study the structure of the Akhbar al-Akhyar to comprehend how a Muslim intellectual constructed a history of his peer group at a critical juncture in the making of Mughal authority. It follows a prosopographical methodology to explore the innovative structure of the Akhbar al-Akhyar and its complex projection of the past of the piety-minded in Hindustan. As I argue, the Akhbar al-Akhyar is a carefully structured, remarkable history of sufis and their networks, providing them with contexts and significance that questioned both, inherited paradigms of moral authority present in the fourteenth-and fifteenth-century sufi texts.

Existing scholarship on the _A'in_, largely uses this text either for (a) evidence on Mughal administration and bureaucracy, or (b) evidence of Akbar's pluralistic views on religion. Operating from the point of view that divination is intimately linked to power, this paper's thesis is that examining Abu'l Fazl's presentation of divination sheds valuable light on how this pragmatic Mughal official sought to equip his patron and fellow courtiers with the means to maintain their political influence, no matter the source of said means. Of key importance here is understanding the way that Abu'l Fazl clearly valued knowledge traditions that were non-Islamic in nature, thus bringing into question the notion that the predominantly Muslim membership of the Mughal court would have been predisposed against practices originating with Hindus, Jains, and other Indian groups. After introducing the _A'in_ and describing its general outline, this paper presents the \"Svara\" section in depth. It then places the practices from \"Svara\" within a broader context of debates over the relationship between Akbar's policies towards non-Muslims under his rule. The paper concludes with an analysis of what scholars can learn about Mughal attitudes towards non-Muslim Indian knowledge traditions, as well as posing questions for future development.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55418931, "asset_id": 35553458, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7226269, "first_name": "Patrick", "last_name": "DSilva", "domain_name": "uccs", "page_name": "PatrickDSilva", "display_name": "Patrick DSilva", "profile_url": "https://uccs.academia.edu/PatrickDSilva?f_ri=17239", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 122, "name": "Comparative Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Religion?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7322, "name": "Mysticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mysticism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30010, "name": "Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Empire?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30571, "name": "Islamic Mysticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Mysticism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 80719, "name": "Mughal India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mughal_India?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 103465, "name": "Breathing Techniques", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Breathing_Techniques?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 35537398, "title": "The survival and resurgence of Sufism in the UK", "created_at": "2017-12-29T11:11:04.806-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35537398/The_survival_and_resurgence_of_Sufism_in_the_UK?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_35537398", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55402969, "asset_id": 35537398, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 59062963, "first_name": "Ted", "last_name": "Bearup", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "TedBearup", "display_name": "Ted Bearup", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/TedBearup?f_ri=17239", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 17240, "name": "Contemporary Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 146099, "name": "Contemporary Islamic Culture in Uk", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Islamic_Culture_in_Uk?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 514685, "name": "British Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Islam?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35535513, "title": "Naf\u012bs\u012b REF.pdf", "created_at": "2017-12-29T05:30:29.691-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35535513/Naf%C4%ABs%C4%AB_REF_pdf?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_35535513", "summary": "\nLe dilemme du Docteur \u2018Abb\u0101s Naf\u012bs\u012b,\nou comment pr\u00e9senter \u012asm\u0101'\u012bl Jurj\u0101n\u012b,  \u012bm\u0101m et m\u00e9decin, \nau public europ\u00e9en en 1933.\n\nDr. Berrtand THIERRY des EPESSES\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55400936, "asset_id": 35535513, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 42800047, "first_name": "Bertrand", "last_name": "THIERRY des EPESSES", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "BertrandTHIERRYdesEPESSES", "display_name": "Bertrand THIERRY des EPESSES", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/BertrandTHIERRYdesEPESSES?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/42800047/13862974/14942116/s65_bertrand.thierry_des_epesses.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2273, "name": "History of Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Medicine?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5218, "name": "Iranian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iranian_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6117, "name": "History of Iran", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Iran?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35465028, "title": "Vernacularization of Islam and Sufism in South Asia:A Study of the Production of Sufi Literature in Local Languages (Journal of the Research Society of Pakistan, Vol. 54, No. 1, Jan-June, 2017, pp. 190-207)", "created_at": "2017-12-19T00:21:18.858-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35465028/Vernacularization_of_Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia_A_Study_of_the_Production_of_Sufi_Literature_in_Local_Languages_Journal_of_the_Research_Society_of_Pakistan_Vol_54_No_1_Jan_June_2017_pp_190_207_?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_35465028", "summary": "Vernacularization of Islam is the process through which the message and teachings of Islam adjusted and adapted in local regional environments outside Arabia.

Blessed with the 14 different chains of Sufism, he rendered remarkable services to the development of Chishti and Qadiri Sufi orders in India.

However, none of them were monolithic entity. The article looks into the dynamism of sufi world through its ideal and praxis. The contours of relationship between ulama and Sufis have also been explored. 'Religion, properly so called, is by its very nature a revolution. For its prime purpose is to give humanity a forward pull by establishing a new social order in place of the old.' 1 During the first half of seventh century AD, on the horizon of the known world, rose a religion-Islam, encompassing in its fold 'revolutionary mission'. It spread, at an alarming and surprising speed, in various parts of the world. During the process, it affected and was influenced by existing religions, political cultures, social and economic milieu, local traditions and customs, and cultural formations of various regions across time and space. During the process of its evolution and spread, and over a period of time, ulama appeared as the custodian of the sharia (Islamic law) and champions of religious terrain and praxis. But authority of this institution did not go unchallenged. By the close of tenth century AD tasawwuf (Islamic mysticism) had already developed as a movement with its basic doctrines and terminologies; texts were written and philosophy expounded representing sufi thought and ideas. The movement challenged the monopoly of the ulama on the issue of knowledge and following. Then conflict ensued between the two-sufis and ulama for both claimed the same constituency.

Las t\u00e9cnicas que har\u00edan posible la realizaci\u00f3n de dichas b\u00fasquedas pueden ser esbozadas en los siguientes t\u00e9rminos: se trata de rituales cuya finalidad consist\u00eda en trascender los l\u00edmites de la experiencia individual. En otras palabras, se procuraba la superac\u00edon de los confines de la conciencia ordinaria que determina nuestros esquemas mentales para, de este modo, alcanzar los mundos espirituales en los confines de lo desconocido. Mediante ese tipo de haza\u00f1as, el cham\u00e1n lograba entrar en contacto con las fuerzas de los mundos superiores; haciendo posible, a su vez, que los hombres participen de los influjos divinos. En terminos generales, y siguiendo las pautas te\u00f3ricas de ciertas corrientes antropol\u00f3gicas y de fenomenolog\u00eda de la religi\u00f3n, cuando nos referimos al chamanismo, estar\u00edamos hablando de pr\u00e1cticas rituales cuyas caracter\u00edsticas pertenecen a estadios de conciencia religiosa que existieron en la antig\u00fcedad arcaica y cuyos focos de origen indican que habr\u00edan surgido de las estepas de Asia Central y Siberia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54253440, "asset_id": 34363461, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 67592330, "first_name": "Armando", "last_name": "Montoya-Jord\u00e1n", "domain_name": "ugr", "page_name": "ArmandoMontoyaJord\u00e1n", "display_name": "Armando Montoya-Jord\u00e1n", "profile_url": "https://ugr.academia.edu/ArmandoMontoyaJord%C3%A1n?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/67592330/17579078/17639467/s65_armando.montoya-jord_n.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4106, "name": "Yoga Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yoga_Philosophy?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6555, "name": "Shamanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shamanism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 34344586, "title": "The inner reality of the Law according to Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi's Teachings", "created_at": "2017-08-24T15:00:11.598-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34344586/The_inner_reality_of_the_Law_according_to_Shaykh_Ahmad_Sirhindis_Teachings?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_34344586", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54237987, "asset_id": 34344586, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3523439, "first_name": "Demetrio", "last_name": "Giordani", "domain_name": "unimore", "page_name": "DemetrioGiordani", "display_name": "Demetrio  Giordani", "profile_url": "https://unimore.academia.edu/DemetrioGiordani?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3523439/1208416/10395879/s65_demetrio.giordani.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 540, "name": "Islamic Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Law?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5674, "name": "Islamic Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Philosophy?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5675, "name": "Kalam (Islamic Theology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kalam_Islamic_Theology_?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 12391, "name": "History of Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Islam?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 14288, "name": "History of the Islamic World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Islamic_World?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 15800, "name": "Islamic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_History?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 28459, "name": "Tariqa Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tariqa_Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 31841, "name": "History of Islamic Civilization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Islamic_Civilization?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 51464, "name": "Tasavvuf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tasavvuf?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 51467, "name": "History of Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 59854, "name": "Islamic Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Theology?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 114106, "name": "Tasawwuf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tasawwuf?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 389813, "name": "History of Sufi Tradition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Sufi_Tradition?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 647028, "name": "Sufism and Tasawwuf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_and_Tasawwuf?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 673478, "name": "Tasavvuf Tarihi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tasavvuf_Tarihi?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 1332929, "name": "Makalah Akhlaq Tasawwuf Maqamat Wal Ahwal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Makalah_Akhlaq_Tasawwuf_Maqamat_Wal_Ahwal?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 2545414, "name": "Middle East and Central Asia Studies;

The relic is obviously not the Prophet, but it is also not-not the Prophet, as the hair is filled with the baraka (blessings) of the Prophet and thereby seems to confirm Sir James Frazer\u2019s thesis of \u2018sympathetic magic\u2019 where part and wholes are forever connected. Based on a study of the Naqshbandi Mujaddidi Saifi tariqa, this paper set out to \u2018follow the hair\u2019 in different settings in Denmark, Norway and Pakistan in order to discuss how it connects the visible and the invisible aspects of reality. I argue that the relic not only constitutes an affective presence of the beloved, but also that it becomes a significant agent in the establishment of an enchanted subaltern counter-public within Danish secular society.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54531249, "asset_id": 34328065, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25536467,

"work_31908365", "summary": "The Physical and Spiritual Phenomena After many years of pondering, I believe that the mystical poet-saint-literary genius Jalaluddin Rumi, in the field of Islamic literature and philosophy, stands high above other sages (hukama), philosophers, and religious scholars of the past or present. The magnitude and insight of his thought and his instinctive and experiential approaches supported by his formal education have proved Rumi fully capable of inquiring, penetrating, and philosophizing deeply into the meanings of both physical and spiritual phenomena. His profound understanding and address of the complexities of a coherent philosophy is at least comparable with that of any contemporary philosopher of his period. Although he does not stand in the order of a particular school of philosophers, he was fully aware of the commentaries and interpretations of Muslim thinkers about Classical Greek philosophy. The impact of Muslim philosophers' translations and their commentaries on Greek philosophers, especially of Averroes (Ibn Rushd 1126-1198) and his contemporary Jewish philosopher Maimonides (1135-1204), on Latin philosophical thought was such that Western thought between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries is inexplicable without considering the conceptual contribution of Averroes' presentation of rational and scientific discourses. Averroes and many other Jewish and Muslim philosophers reflected that there are different routes to the same truth, that served as a modern foundation for theoretical openness,",

SHAH WALIULLAH AL-DAHLAWI (d. 1762) was eminent scholar who contributed much to field of   SHARIA   Objectives   although   it   firstly   appeared   in a comprehensive and detailed way in the works of IBN ASHUR and AL SHATIBI. His work   HUJJATALLAHALBALIGHA   (the conclusive   argument from Allah) which is his magnum opus, fully reflects his holistic vision of life. AL- DHLAWI ideas in this work were seen as partnership between THASAWUF and JURISPRUDENCE to support the principles of   SHARI\u2018AH   as a stability between the worldly and hereafter demands. He named this branch of knowledge as ILMUASRARSHARIA. The five fundamental SHARIA objectives   I e , protection of religion, life, reason, progeny and property with it all subsidiary categories as later elaborated encompasses making of an ideal civilization. This civilization talk is keeping a sheer contrast with IRTIFAQAT theory explained by DAHLAWI in his HUJJA which is the third discussion in it. The four   stages   of   civilization   growth, ranging from basic needs of human being as animals, passing through idealization of these needs by moral codes and ethics reaches its third  level  of  achieving  a  civilization  identity which urges a KHILAFAKULLIYYA to get out of conflicts arising in third level. The second stage demands five kinds of wisdom which are essential for all aspects of   civilization. This study analyses IRTIFAQAT theory to draw a parallel line between civilization talks in MAQASIDSHARIA and   DAHLAWI\u2018s   ideas.

The district is well-known for the higher proportion of international migrants (with 3,13,303 emigrants) 1 on one side and on the other side practices of popular culture of Islam (visitation to shrines) is also at its best. Majority of the masses regularly visit shrines within and outside the district to perform number of rituals in a bid to get rid of the socioeconomic , psychological and health issues. This study was conducted in the village Karrianwala in Tehsil (sub-district) of Gujrat. The respondents were mainly depending on foreign remittances for livelihoods. These foreign remittances have altered the lives of inhabitants at many levels. Their access to the luxuries of life was mainly influenced by these remittances. It was observed, during the fieldwork, that majority of the migrant households were inclined towards the spiritual healing practices at the time of illness of the family members in addition to the modern treatments like allopathy.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51052446, "asset_id": 30606717, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 678814, "first_name": "Zulfiqar", "last_name": "Ali Kalhoro", "domain_name": "pide", "page_name": "ZulfiqarAliKalhoro", "display_name": "Zulfiqar  Ali Kalhoro", "profile_url": "https://pide.academia.edu/ZulfiqarAliKalhoro?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/678814/1075754/20948883/s65_zulfiqar.ali_kalhoro.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16471, "name": "Sociology of Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Migration?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 19046, "name": "Migration (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Anthropology_?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 48150, "name": "Pakistan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan_Studies?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 559757, "name": "Religion and migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_migration?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 30532498, "title": "American Sufis and American Islam: From Private Spirituality to the Public Sphere", "created_at": "2016-12-19T17:59:58.585-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30532498/American_Sufis_and_American_Islam_From_Private_Spirituality_to_the_Public_Sphere?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_30532498", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50975680, "asset_id": 30532498, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 125862, "first_name": "Marcia", "last_name": "Hermansen", "domain_name": "luc", "page_name": "MarciaHermansen", "display_name": "Marcia Hermansen", "profile_url": "https://luc.academia.edu/MarciaHermansen?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/125862/33609/30877/s65_marcia.hermansen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 17240, "name": "Contemporary Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24788, "name": "Sufism in the West", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_in_the_West?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 30484922, "title": "\u0421\u0443\u0444\u0438\u0437\u043c \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0438\u0437\u043c: \u0432\u0437\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434 \u0438\u0437 \u0413\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0438 XIX \u0432.", "created_at": "2016-12-16T10:08:27.858-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30484922/%D0%A1%D1%83%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BC_%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA_%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BC_%D0%B2%D0%B7%D0%B3%D0%BB%D1%8F%D0%B4_%D0%B8%D0%B7_%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B8_XIX_%D0%B2?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_30484922", "summary": "The article focuses on the examination of the conceptions of Sufism in German thought (1800\u20131830).

The author explaines Tholuck\u2019s theory of mysticism in general and Sufism in particular. Tholuck asserts that Sufism is of pure Arabo-Islamic origin. Author also thoroughly explains why Sufism that time was understood as a kind of pantheism. The following ideas make Tholuck\u2019s perspective important for modernity. (1) They illustrate how different philosophical worldviews and concepts determine the description of other cultures. (2) They represent an important development of the European Oriental studies and science of religion. (3) They use almost forgotten but worth studying sources. (4) They point out close connection of early Oriental studies and philosophy. (5) They contain the original concept of mysticism", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50923284, "asset_id": 30484922, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 21612956, "first_name": "Vsevolod", "last_name": "Zolotukhin", "domain_name": "aaatec", "page_name": "VsevolodZolotukhin", "display_name": "Vsevolod  Zolotukhin", "profile_url": "https://aaatec.academia.edu/VsevolodZolotukhin?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/21612956/9504358/10589099/s65__._.jpg_oh_c2b70b7a6aa7998a8bc68121592497be_oe_55f09ded___gda___1442579324_7c0322f983fd0af1476126b74ddfaca7"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6202, "name": "German Idealism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_Idealism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28686, "name": "Pantheism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pantheism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33550, "name": "Evangelical Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Evangelical_Theology?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 51334, "name": "Orientalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Orientalism?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 30450238, "title": "SHARI\u2019AH & TASAWWUF: DEFINITIONS & RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM", "created_at": "2016-12-14T17:07:13.185-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30450238/SHARI_AH_and_TASAWWUF_DEFINITIONS_and_RELATIONSHIP_BETWEEN_THEM?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_30450238", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50891633, "asset_id": 30450238, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 54040780, "first_name": "Rezart", "last_name": "Beka", "domain_name": "georgetown", "page_name": "RezartBeka", "display_name": "Rezart Beka", "profile_url": "https://georgetown.academia.edu/RezartBeka?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/54040780/14255722/15214687/s65_rezart.beka.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 30376789, "title": "IBN ARABI.pdf", "created_at": "2016-12-11T00:49:26.797-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30376789/IBN_ARABI_pdf?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_30376789", "summary": "Biografi Sang Sufi Ibn Arabi", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50826827, "asset_id": 30376789, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 56324800, "first_name": "Toni", "last_name": "Anggoro", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ToniAnggoro", "display_name": "Toni Anggoro", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ToniAnggoro?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://gravatar.com/avatar/1e5c55a0f73ef0234d27437891205a82?s=65"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 343975, "name": "Tasawuf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tasawuf?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 29774773, "title": "Mulla Vajhi's Sabras (published in Islam, Sufism and Everyday Politics of Belonging in South Asia; edited byDeepra Dandekar and Torsten Tschacher, Routledge 2016, pp. 279-293)", "created_at": "2016-11-10T00:49:21.203-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29774773/Mulla_Vajhis_Sabras_published_in_Islam_Sufism_and_Everyday_Politics_of_Belonging_in_South_Asia_edited_byDeepra_Dandekar_and_Torsten_Tschacher_Routledge_2016_pp_279_293_?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_29774773", "summary": "Mulla Vajhi\u2019s Sabras\nChristina Oesterheld, South Asia Institute Heidelberg\nMulla Asadullah \u2018Vajhi\u2019 (1580-ca. 1660) was among the most prominent poets in both Da-kini and Persian at the court of Golkonda/Dekkhan. Around 1609 he composed his famous masnavi Qutb Mushtari, one of the first masnavis of the Dakini language. The second work he is remembered for today is the allegorical prose tale Sabras (All tastes, 1635), the first literary prose text of Dakini and also Urdu, if Dakini is regarded as an old variety of Urdu.\nThe story combines two main leitmotifs: the search for the water of life and the love between Husn (Beauty) and Dil (Heart) which also leads to a battle between Ishq (Love) and Aql (Reason). In accordance with Sufi teachings, Love triumphs over Reason, and Beauty and Heart are united in marriage. The tale contains a number of subplots and lengthy didactic digressions, including remarks on Sufi wisdom, a praise of reason, the duties of a king, and many others. It follows the standard formal pattern of masnavi texts, beginning with a praise of God, of the Prophet and of Ali, continuing with the reason for composing the work and praise of the king. All chapters are preceded by subtitles in Persian which summarize the con-tents. The third chapter explains the title of the work and mentions the author\u2019s intention, the role of literature and literary language, and promises deep insights into mystic wisdom and truths as reward of reading the text\nAs is to be expected, Vajhi privileges love over reason as a tool to achieve deeper knowledge or wisdom. It is interesting to analyse his arguments and in particular the terminology he uses for this purpose. While on the one hand he relies heavily on quotations from the Quran and Hadith and quotes Persian couplets, he also uses terms derived from Sanskrit in their New Indo-Aryan form as well as popular sayings and couplets in a language combining elements of Dakkini, Braj and Gujri. He thus attempts to combine the authority of the Islamic scrip-tures with Sufi interpretations, geared to the worldly audience of a regional court and provid-ing legitimacy to the king who had commissioned the work. And while stressing his location in the Deccan and expressly indicating regional usages, he claims a wider reach by calling his language zaban(-i) Hindustan and referring to Sufi authorities in Gwalior and Gujarat. It is a fascinating case of negotiating the spiritual and the worldly, of Sunni and Shiite beliefs and of markers of Muslim and non-Muslim identities.\nVajhi revels in displaying his proficiency in a wide range of languages and makes full use of the potential of word-play, rhyme and amplification which his diverse linguistic material pro-vides. Not feeling restricted by any sense of a communality of languages, he feels entitled to appropriate suitable words, verses and proverbial sayings irrespective of their provenance, and his work in turn becomes part of a boundless literary and spiritual landscape.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50226544, "asset_id": 29774773, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

"work_28454572", "summary": "In this article, two threads of scholarship on the relationship of what shall\r\nbe called here the \u2018Deoband project\u2019 and politics are negotiated. Both\r\nthese threads frame this relationship in absolute terms: one considers\r\nDeoband as a politically neutral yet rather homogeneous \u2018movement\u2019 for\r\nthe reform of religious beliefs and practices, while the other cast it in a\r\nsimilar monolithic fashion as an anti-colonial champion of social justice.\r\nAgainst this mutual exclusiveness, it is argued here that a revised understanding\r\nof what \u2018Deoband\u2019 constitutes and stands for will help to show\r\nthat, although it did not often make a politics explicit, embedded in a\r\ngenealogy of the \u2018Deoband project\u2019 as a phenomenon is an activist\r\niteration of Sufism, one that developed in dialogue between classes in\r\nthe stratified semi-urban milieus of the imperial heartland around\r\nDeoband, and South Asian rural peripheries. In the early twentieth\r\ncentury, this conversation developed into what is idealtypically framed\r\nhere as \u2018Islamic Pietism\u2019.\r\nAll this is argued through a survey of the literature surrounding one of\r\nDeoband\u2019s least-documented, yet possibly most famous, scholars:\r\nMa\u1e25m\u016bd al-\u1e24asan, commonly known as \u2018Shaykh al-Hind\u2019. In narrating\r\n\u2018Islamic Pietism\u2019 across Ma\u1e25m\u016bd al-\u1e24asan\u2019s life, but also his milieu and\r\nthe careers of his compatriots, not only a major gap in the historical\r\nresearch of contemporary South Asian Islam is addressed. More so, it is\r\nhighlighted how even renowned individual actors were constituted by\r\ncross-class and multi-scalar networks of thought and agency \u2013 almost as\r\nmuch as they disproportionately transformed them.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48833192, "asset_id": 28454572, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3336470, "first_name":

He established a Western Sufi order, the International Sufi Movement, with groups in America, England, and across Europe. In the early 1930s this Western Sufism was introduced into Australia. The aim of this study is to explore and analyse the origins, nature and development of the Sufi Movement in Australia with particular attention to the relationship between the spiritual teacher and the disciple. The study, in its various aspects, and as a whole, makes a contribution to  understanding religious change, religion and New Religious Movements in Australia, Sufism in the West and the murshid-mureed relationship.\r\n\r\nUsing what has been termed a \u201cdynamic of religions\u201d framework and Baumann\u2019s model of religious adaptation in cross-cultural circumstances, the study employs a combination of in-depth fieldwork, participant observation, interviews and historiography to identify and analyse both continuity and change in Sufi Movement groups in contemporary Australia. The study found that the early phases of transplantation from India to Europe and America, as well as the struggles within the group after the death of Inayat Khan, substantially shaped the Western Sufism that arrived in Australia. The most significant early adaptations included redefining the relationship between Sufism and exoteric Islam, gender equality, formation of a formal organisation, and the use of music to spread the Sufi Message. \r\n\r\nAddressing issues identified in the literature on the master-disciple relationship in Eastern traditions in the West, the study describes and analyses the murshid-mureed (master-disciple, spiritual teacher-student) relationship in Inayat Khan\u2019s time, and in contemporary Australia. It shows that Sufism\u2019s development in the West has been interconnected with understandings and practice of this central relationship. \r\n\r\nThe study shows that the continued strength of the murshid-mureed relationship alongside emerging alternatives, the factors affecting change generally in the Sufi Movement, as well as the growing popularity of Sufism in Australia, demonstrate the need to consider not only East-West aspects of transplantation, but also the influences of modernity on spiritual traditions.\r\n\r\nAs well as documenting the Australian history, the study describes the details of the variety of practices and rituals, forms of community and organisation, and forms of the murshid-mureed relationship, found in contemporary Australian groups. This provides insight into the intricacies of Sufi practice in Australia and provides a basis for comparison with other groups. Sufi practice within these groups in Australia includes highly innovative developments alongside preservation of the tradition as taught by Inayat Khan. It also reflects a tension between the spiritual and organisational hierarchy, and concerns for democracy and local autonomy. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54726044, "asset_id": 27034089, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 54726054, "asset_id": 27034089, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 54726051, "asset_id": 27034089, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 54726075, "asset_id": 27034089, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 54726045, "asset_id": 27034089, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 54726047, "asset_id": 27034089, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 54726041, "asset_id": 27034089, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1531909, "first_name": "Celia", "last_name": "Genn", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "CeliaGenn", "display_name": "Celia Genn", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/CeliaGenn?f_ri=17239", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 17240, "name": "Contemporary Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 26988866, "title": "Spiritual Evolution in Attar\u2019s and Mevlana\u2019s  works", "created_at": "2016-07-14T11:04:33.535-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26988866/Spiritual_Evolution_in_Attar_s_and_Mevlana_s_works?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_26988866", "summary": "In Attar`s and Mevlana`s work, the reflected are the points and the moments of spiritual trip of a God lover-salik.

Professing any of the religions involves the adherence of righteousness to attain spiritual enlightenment, so as to find purpose and meaning of life. It is accepted wisdom that spiritual leaders and followers of Buddhism and Islam have been largely unaware of each others' beliefs, practices and traditions, these two are not just religions, they form two different religious civilizations with an ever growing populations subscribing to them every day. Chronologically these two religious civilizations have interacted in both constructive and destructive ways. Religious doctrines have been used to rally the troops in times of clashes, but research has shown that the motives behind the conflicts have been centered primarily on economical, political, and strategic military issues and not faith based issues. Sufi Law happens to be the Islamic jurisprudence written in ancient Greek, which was first introduced by the Prophet Muhammad as the founder of the Islamic faith in the 7th Century, which was later methodically corrupted by the Apocalyptic Mithraic Parasite Umayyad Dynasty with intent of conspiracy during the 7 th century. Sufism being the rational tradition of Islam enshrines enlightened wisdom of Islamic spirituality, the saints built shrines as graves for their spiritual masters, used to circumambulate them and lit butter lamps, which is highly reminiscent of Buddhist spiritual practices of erecting stupas of deceased masters.

It acknowledges universality, pluralism and peaceful mutual coexistence by connecting different people, allowing them a common space to have exchange of ideas about religion, divinity and faith in order to make sense of life. A spiritually transcendent life is a parallel life, which must be practiced honestly, soulfully and unconditionally, we dedicate ourselves to the greater truth, bringing up all the divinity we have had in our lives to the forefront, the divinity which was never short of human perfections. Pilgrimage is a practice which instills spirituality and orients the cosmos around a significantly holy shrine. It makes individuals experience unique positivity and sets the stage for the integration of self around the spiritual symbols. While in India, pilgrimage to Sufi shrines is a common practice but there are many who consider such practices as extra religious, yet millions of them have reportedly got benefitted from such pilgrimages. The rise of professional interest in transpersonal psychology tends to explore the multiplicity, prevalence and salience of spirituality among people; consequently garnering considerable attention from the researchers in psychology. All the solace seekers represent the ideal and the real, where ideal is self-transcendence while the real is the Supreme Being's all-pervading Consciousness. The concern of this research was to illustrate, investigate and reason as to what these shrines have to offer in return, to the swarming solace seekers, finding insights to the psychological attributes of spirituality and transcendence with respect to Sufism. The study thus endeavored to understand the spiritual yearnings behind the centuries old practice of pilgrimage to Sufi shrines. It also attempted to find whether they experience transcendence or found meaning in their respective lives.

"work_22536503", "summary": "Abstract\nIt is commonly accepted by R\u016bm\u012b scholars that R\u016bm\u012b\u2019s Mathnaw\u012b is composed of six volumes. However, a few sources indicate the possibility of an extra volume known as \u201cBook Seven\u201d of the Mathnaw\u012b. My study particularly focuses on the unpublished commentary (shar\u1e25) on Book Seven written by Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl Anqaraw\u012b (d. 1631), the most important Ottoman commentator on the Mathnaw\u012b. It is an addendum to his commentary on the Mathnaw\u012b entitled Majm\u016b\u2018at al-La\u1e6d\u0101\u2019if wa Ma\u1e6dm\u016brat al-Ma\u2018\u0101rif (Collection of Subtleties and Hidden Store of Knowledge). Since the commentary and its publication received major criticism from Sufis belonging to the Mevlev\u012b order, it is the aim of this study to explore the reasons for the composition of the commentary. Why did Anqaraw\u012b, a respected Mevlev\u012b shaykh who was in charge of G\u0101l\u0101t\u0101 Sufi lodge and taught the Mathnaw\u012bfor several years, devote his energy to writing a separate commentary on a text widely considered to be spurious? \u2028My study is based primarily on the textual analysis and close examination of 45 Ottoman manuscripts of Anqaraw\u012b\u2019s shar\u1e25, which I consulted in the S\u00fcleym\u0101niye library, Konya\u2019s Mevl\u0101n\u0101 Museum, Bursa\u2019s Inebey Manuscript Library, and Ankara\u2019s Mell\u012b Library. I argue that the debate in which Anqaraw\u012b engaged can be divided into two parts: First, that the shar\u1e25 encountered heavy criticism within the Mevlev\u012b circle for its falsification and spurious nature, and second, that the subjects discussed in the shar\u1e25 resulted in strong opposition from orthodox \u2018ulam\u0101\u2019 on the grounds that it promoted bid\u2018a (\u201cinnovation\u201d or \u201cheresy\u201d). By examining Anqaraw\u012b\u2019s introduction, which presents a detailed account of his debate with Mevlev\u012b Sufis and Shaykhs, I argue that Anqaraw\u012b claimed authority as the ultimate commentator and Mathnaw\u012b-kh\u0101n (Mathnaw\u012b-reciter) among the Mevlev\u012b Sufis, a claim that was bolstered by his closeness to Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Mur\u0101d IV (d. 1640). \u2028Given that Anqaraw\u012b scholarship is only recently emerging and his monumental commentary has not been studied properly, the present work contributes to the study of R\u016bm\u012b and reception of his Mathnaw\u012b not only in the Persian speaking regions, but also within Ottoman society. This study will shed light on various aspects of the social and religious debates among the \u2018ulam\u0101\u2019 in the 17th-century Ottoman Empire. It will also allow for a better understanding of the intellectual milieu of the empire, the social status and political roles of the \u2018ulam\u0101\u2019 and the power wielded by official religious institutions and their affiliated scholars.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43150802, "asset_id": 22536503, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 281916, "first_name": "Eliza", "last_name": "Tasbihi", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ElizaTasbihi", "display_name": "Eliza Tasbihi", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ElizaTasbihi?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/281916/69296/14302749/s65_eliza.tasbihi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1269, "name": "Persian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persian_Literature?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26891, "name": "Manuscripts (Medieval Studies)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Manuscripts_Medieval_Studies_?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 75314, "name": "Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mevlana_Jalaluddin_Rumi?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 111827, "name": "Ottoman History and Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ottoman_History_and_Literature?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 187339, "name": "Sufism: Rumi and the early Mevlevi order", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_Rumi_and_the_early_Mevlevi_order?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 301349, "name": "Descripton and Cataloguing Ottoman Turkish Manuscrpits of the Matenadaran Collaction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Descripton_and_Cataloguing_Ottoman_Turkish_Manuscrpits_of_the_Matenadaran_Collaction?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 407393, "name": "Persian Language and Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persian_Language_and_Literature?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 2406117, "name": "Ismail Anqarawi (Ankaravi)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ismail_Anqarawi_Ankaravi_?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 2406930, "name": "17th century Ottoman manuscripts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_century_Ottoman_manuscripts?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 22485926, "title": "Sacred Spaces: A journey with the Sufis of Indus", "created_at": "2016-02-26T10:33:20.690-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/22485926/Sacred_Spaces_A_journey_with_the_Sufis_of_Indus?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_22485926", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43106951, "asset_id": 22485926, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 281916, "first_name": "Eliza", "last_name": "Tasbihi", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ElizaTasbihi", "display_name": "Eliza Tasbihi", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ElizaTasbihi?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/281916/69296/14302749/s65_eliza.tasbihi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 820636, "name": "Sufism, Art, Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_Art_Culture?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1003593, "name": "Popular Culture and Sufi Shrines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Culture_and_Sufi_Shrines?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 22161834, "title": "REGIONAL FOLKLORES OF PAKISTAN IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF SUFI POETRY AND ITS ROLE FOR PEACE AND INTEGRITY", "created_at": "2016-02-18T21:53:15.852-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/22161834/REGIONAL_FOLKLORES_OF_PAKISTAN_IN_THE_PERSPECTIVE_OF_SUFI_POETRY_AND_ITS_ROLE_FOR_PEACE_AND_INTEGRITY?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_22161834", "summary": "Regional folklores of Pakistan like other folklores around the globe encompass poetry, songs, sonnets, tales, legends, myths, traditions, customs and proverbs.

It begins with contextual history and background concerning the place of what modern Western social theory calls \u201cpsychology\u201d within \u201ctraditional\u201d Islamic healing and Sufism. The chapter next proceeds to introduce Sufi and Islamic personality theory via the best-known component of its psychology: Sufi stories and poetry. The middle part of the chapter discusses in detail the view of the soul and self in Sufi and Islamic psychology. This is seen as a multilayered, multifaceted reality, more akin to a community than an individual. The chapter then examines practical psychotherapeutic techniques used by Sufi teachers in various lineages, including meditation, contemplation, breathing awareness, body awareness, sound, music, and movement. To conclude, the chapter mentions recent efforts to merge traditional Sufi and Islamic personality theory with Freudian, Jungian, humanistic and somatic psychotherapeutic approaches as well as with postmodern models of holistic health.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48379443, "asset_id": 20416551, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 41354977, "asset_id": 20416551, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 41812268, "first_name": "Neil", "last_name": "Douglas-Klotz", "domain_name": "aarweb", "page_name": "NeilDouglasKlotz", "display_name": "Neil Douglas-Klotz", "profile_url": "https://aarweb.academia.edu/NeilDouglasKlotz?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/41812268/11311497/59053567/s65_neil.douglas-klotz.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3307, "name": "Transpersonal Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transpersonal_Psychology?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19543, "name": "Somatic Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Somatic_Psychology?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30571, "name": "Islamic Mysticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Mysticism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 20312051, "title": "Review of A.

Islamic writers and intellectuals in the Middle East and particularly in Egypt were actively engaged in the call for Islamic literature. Several Arabic books, including major works of Sayyed Qutub, Muhammad Qutub, and Naguib Kilani, were written on the subject and immediately rendered into Malaysian and Indonesian languages. Among all these writings, Muhammad Qutub\u2019s book \u201cManhaj El-Fan El-Islami\u201d has had tremendous impact on modern Malay writers such as, Ahmad Kamal Abdullah, Shahnon Ahmad, Muhammad kamal Hassan, Ismail Ibrahim, Muhammad Bukhari Lubis, and others who produced several theories of Islamic literature.In this paper, a new theory of Islamic literature is proposed which is based on the concept of Al-\u2018Alamiah (Universality).In the first part of the paper, existing theories are reviewed whereas in the final part, a number of issues are discussed such as the concept of Islamic literature, its message, and seven basic features that distinguish Islamic literature from other world literatures.    \n\nKeywords: \u2018Alamiah, Adab, Islami, Muslim and Islamic. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40983701, "asset_id": 20060606, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 40915018, "first_name": "Dr. Arif Karkhi", "last_name": "Abukhudairi", "domain_name": "unissa", "page_name": "ArifKhudairi", "display_name": "Dr. Arif Karkhi  Abukhudairi", "profile_url": "https://unissa.academia.edu/ArifKhudairi?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/40915018/11124290/12414303/s65_arif.khudairi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 444224, "name": "Islamic Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Literature?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 19174877, "title": "Indian Female Gurus in Contemporary Hinduism: A Study of Central Aspects and Expressions of Their Religious Leadership.

historians widely acknowledge Sufis\u2019 influence on social life in pre-1947 subcontinent. However, they have produced a limited literature on Sufis\u2019 relationship with professional and marginalized communities (such as traders, artisans and unskilled labour). Part of the problem is the lack of primary source-material available on professional and marginalized communities and methodological tools for constructing such a social history. Currently, social history is facing challenges from other borderline disciplines and social historians are turning their attention towards other types of history. It is now even more important to devise a methodological approach to explore Sufis\u2019 social history which is already being overlooked by social historians. This methodological essay proposes an approach for studying the Sufi-artisan relationship in per-partition Punjab by engaging Peter Berger\u2019s concept of nomos and Robert Darnton\u2019s idea of \u201copacities\u201d in folktales. Both these concepts intend to grasp an insider\u2019s views and can help the social and cultural historians in making sense of a world which is separated by us because of its pre-modern life and mentalit\u00e9.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38911359, "asset_id": 16249212, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 293149, "first_name": "hussain ahmad", "last_name": "khan", "domain_name": "gcu-pk", "page_name": "hussainahmadkhan", "display_name": "hussain ahmad khan", "profile_url": "https://gcu-pk.academia.edu/hussainahmadkhan?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/293149/59395/57516884/s65_hussain_ahmad.khan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9217, "name": "Folktales", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Folktales?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15588, "name": "Social History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_History?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 33833, "name": "History of Colonial India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Colonial_India?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 59115, "name": "Colonial Punjab", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Punjab?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 470091, "name": "Artisans", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Artisans?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 15824409, "title": "Las puertas de la India", "created_at": "2015-09-17T14:43:54.310-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15824409/Las_puertas_de_la_India?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_15824409", "summary": "1. Etapas en la Indolog\u00eda:\n\n\nLa Indologia constituye el estudio acad\u00e9mico referido a la cultura india centrada en torno al idioma sanscrito, abarcando naturalmente el estudio de las filosof\u00edas y religiones de la India. Las corrientes metodol\u00f3gicas actuales que profundizan en la comprensi\u00f3n del mundo indio, requieren tener en cuenta las diversas  perspectivas que ha transitado la Indologia en sus distintos momentos y considerar  precisamente cuales han sido los  diversos estilos de  investigaci\u00f3n que han acompa\u00f1ado su desarrollo.  En particular, es necesario prestar atenci\u00f3n a las corrientes metodol\u00f3gicas  menos frecuentes y por lo tanto, menos  conocidos, y que, sin embargo, est\u00e1n adquiriendo una presencia intensa  en el mundo acad\u00e9mico actual.\n\nEn efecto, la filosof\u00eda india ha sido descripta como el arte del punto de vista. El mismo vocablo utilizado por el pensamiento indio, darsana, para describir sus escuelas filos\u00f3ficas, es altamente sugestivo. Sin embargo, el n\u00facleo del pensamiento que se desprende de las fuentes upanis\u00e1dicas presenta un desaf\u00edo: las upanisad son las fuentes por antonomasia de la filosof\u00eda ortodoxa, es decir, de aquella que acepta la autoridad de los Vedas. En tales fuentes, cuyo estudio filol\u00f3gico hermen\u00e9utico es fundamental e insoslayable, se afirma que la realidad es el Ser Uno y No dual (Brahman). De \u00e9ste se deriva,  en una suerte de cascada ontol\u00f3gica, el devenir explayado en una realidad debilitada, m\u00faltiple y relativa (m\u00e2y\u00e2). Esta manifestaci\u00f3n se entiende de naturaleza dual, es decir,  signada por la dualidad que es, en \u00faltima instancia, semi real (m\u00e2y\u00e2 anirvacan\u00eeya). En ese marco, el an\u00e1lisis \u201cobjetivo\u201d desde lo relativo permanece jaqueado por un objeto de estudio que involucra y trasciende la misma dicotom\u00eda sujeto-objeto. La superaci\u00f3n de semejante obst\u00e1culo requiere poder contemplar lo Insondable   desde tantos puntos de vista como sea posible, ya que la premisa inicial supone que lo finito no puede abarcar la infinitud del Ser Infinito. Ante tal estado de cosas que requiere, necesariamente, de una pluralidad de perspectivas,  se sigue que  la versatilidad metodol\u00f3gica sea un requisito inherente a la misma naturaleza del objeto que se intenta estudiar, oponi\u00e9ndose por lo tanto a cualquier metodolog\u00eda que se arrogue la exclusividad en su aproximaci\u00f3n al pensamiento de  la India . El an\u00e1lisis de fuentes, como ya se advirti\u00f3, resulta el dato inexcusable, sin embargo todo texto se da en un contexto y en su complementaci\u00f3n ambos van conformando la corporeidad de una cultura. Esta particularidad  ha sido considerada por el Prof. Gavin Flood, a quien luego nos referiremos, y cuyo \u00faltimo aporte acad\u00e9mico, El cuerpo T\u00e1ntrico, 2008, determina un punto de inflexi\u00f3n en el desarrollo de la Indolog\u00eda. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38804239, "asset_id": 15824409, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13730035, "first_name": "olivia", "last_name": "cattedra", "domain_name": "conicet-ar", "page_name": "oliviacattedra", "display_name": "olivia cattedra", "profile_url": "https://conicet-ar.academia.edu/oliviacattedra?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13730035/16904331/17127628/s65_olivia.cattedra.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 94916, "name": "Indology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indology?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 15442122, "title": "Farid al-Din \u2018Attar", "created_at": "2015-09-06T04:48:49.606-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15442122/Farid_al_Din_Attar?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_15442122", "summary": "\u201cFarid al-Din \u2018Attar\u201d in ed.

"dom_id": "work_14974282", "summary": "Muhammad Iqbal (1877-1938), one of the 20th century\u2019s most influential Muslim thinkers, theorized a radically new understanding of Islamic selfhood. For Iqbal, the self (khudi) was marked by an individuality that made it distinct and inherently equipped to overcome colonial incursions. Iqbal put this down to Ibn \u2018Arabi\u2019s (1165-1240) \u201cNeo-Platonist doctrine of sheep\u201d of wahdat-al-wujud. This article examines the ways in which Iqbal\u2019s ideas of the self derive from a specifically modern, Western notion of the self that has its history in Rene Descartes\u2019 cogito ergo sum \u2013 a modern selfhood entailing independence and uniqueness, and which became the standard in Europe after the 18th century. It is a self whose worth is measured by what it produces, and by its relationship to the world as a creator. When Iqbal writes that \u201cman becomes unique by becoming more and more like the most unique individual [God],\u201d1 this paper investigates how Iqbal\u2019s approach to the Muslim self is thought through Western categories \u2013 beginning with the self, but extending to the pan-Islamic nation (the ummah), and nationalism \u2013 and how such an imagining delimits his very (re)construction of Islam, thereby further imbricating \u201cIslam\u201d within Eurocentric power-knowledge. The article reflects on the importance of examining perhaps the\nfoundational theoretical assumption of the modern Muslim experience \u2013 Muslim selfhood \u2013 and how such an examination is essential for the process of decolonial thinking to begin.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38493278, "asset_id": 14974282, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

Regrettably, our collective negligence and intellectual stagnation have concealed the pioneering contributions of great Indian mystics in the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment, human welfare and common goodwill. Those loudly claiming to represent the Sawad-Azam (mainstream Muslims) should take cognizance of the worrying fact that a large part of the Indian Sufis\u2019 literature has not yet been published and is in the shape of manuscripts for ages. And that is precisely why they are misrepresented and sometimes defamed by the present-day ignoramuses.\n\nOne such instance is Imam of Ahle Sunnah (Sunni Muslims), Shaikh Abdul Haque Muhaddith Dehlvi (958-1052A.H), one of the leading Islamic scholars of the 11th century. An epoch-making personage well-versed in the sciences of Islam and practices of Sufism, Shaikh Dehlvi rendered historical contributions to the revival and renewal of faith as well as spiritual guidance of the Indian Muslims. It would be no exaggeration to state that from the early 11th century till the late 13th century, almost all remarkable works and researches on the classical Islamic sciences in India were a result of rigorous intellectual efforts and endeavours made by   Shaikh Abdul Haque Muhaddith Dehlvi.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38480351, "asset_id": 14935555, "asset_type": "Work",

Browne purchased a manuscript comprising Shabistari\u2019s Gulshan-i Raz (Rose Garden of Mystery), a text on dream interpretation, and a text on the science of the breath (\u2018ilm-i dam).  Written in Persian and purchased from an a dying \u2018aref (mystic), this text provides readers with methods of breath control that allow the user to successfully go to war, succeed in courtly intrigue, recover stolen items, know the sex of an unborn child, read other people\u2019s thoughts, and predict the moment of their death.  While Browne identifies it as a Sufi treatise, this label fails to describe it adequately.  It includes Persian transliterations of Sanskrit terms like maha bhuta (\u201cgreat elements,\u201d referring to the five elements of earth, air, water, fire, and heaven) without explanation, and refers to Indian (hinduvan) cremation grounds, implying that the audience would be familiar with Sanskrit and live in proximity to some type of identifiably Indian/Hindu community.  It shares material with a number of other texts, including an entry under \u201cNatural Sciences\u201d in the Nefa\u2019is al-funun, a 14th century Persian encyclopedia;  the 14th century Persian text, The Kamarupa Seed Syllables; Persian and Arabic translations of the now lost Sanskrit text, the Amrtakunda (\u201cPool of Nectar\u201d - the oldest extant text with illustrated instruction on yogic postures); a late 19th century Urdu text titled Asrar-e-darvesh (The Secrets of the Dervish); as well as late 20th century texts on \u2018ulum al-ghraiba (\u201cOccult Sciences\u201d) cited by Iranian Ayatollah Hassan Zadeh Amali, and the Secret Power of Tantrik Breathing by Swami Sivapriyananda, as part of his treatment of svara-udaya (divination) in the Hindu Yogic tradition.\nThis paper situates this manuscript within a network of philosophical, economic, and artistic exchange between India and Iran, as well as poses questions of what to do with a manuscript whose contents defy inherited categories of Hindu/Muslim, Yoga/Sufism, and religion/magic/science.  What do we do with texts (and their hypothetical readers) whose square pegs do not fit within commonly found round holes of scholarly discourse?  What are the consequences of dismissing this text as \u2018other\u2019 or \u2018superstitious magic\u2019 for 21st century constructions and formulations of Muslim identity, and whose agenda is served by these constructions?\nDrawing on recent scholarship by Carl Ernst, Barry Finbar Flood, Nile Green, and Randall Styers, these questions require a nuanced approach.  The text anonymous author provides instruction for undertaking such difficult endeavors by describing the five-fold breath and its components, then explaining the link between the sun and moon and right and left breaths, respectively, before advising: \u201cOnce this knowledge if apprehended, I will say which breath was good in correspondence to a given action, and which was not good.\u201d  Rather than attempting to ascertain the efficacy of these claims, this paper works to develop a productive framework for addressing marginalized texts and their communities.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37605449, "asset_id": 12338642, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7226269, "first_name": "Patrick", "last_name": "DSilva", "domain_name": "uccs", "page_name": "PatrickDSilva", "display_name": "Patrick DSilva", "profile_url": "https://uccs.academia.edu/PatrickDSilva?f_ri=17239", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 114, "name": "Hinduism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hinduism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1269, "name": "Persian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persian_Literature?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4104, "name": "Yoga", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yoga?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4106, "name": "Yoga Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yoga_Philosophy?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239"}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239"}]}, {"id": 12102101, "title": "Mirza Mazhar Jan-i Janan, erede di Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi", "created_at": "2015-04-25T07:12:50.310-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12102101/Mirza_Mazhar_Jan_i_Janan_erede_di_Shaykh_Ahmad_Sirhindi?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_12102101", "summary": "Note biografiche su uno dei pi\u00f9 importanti personaggi dell'India del XVIII secolo", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37418723, "asset_id": 12102101, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3523439, "first_name": "Demetrio", "last_name": "Giordani", "domain_name": "unimore", "page_name": "DemetrioGiordani", "display_name": "Demetrio  Giordani", "profile_url": "https://unimore.academia.edu/DemetrioGiordani?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3523439/1208416/10395879/s65_demetrio.giordani.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3024, "name": "History of India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_India?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14288, "name": "History of the Islamic World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Islamic_World?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15800, "name": "Islamic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_History?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 11996966, "title": "Amir Khushrau: The Musical Soul of India", "created_at": "2015-04-17T23:55:17.061-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11996966/Amir_Khushrau_The_Musical_Soul_of_India?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_11996966", "summary": "Music is the soul of India from ancient times.

helping, benefitting, etc. The word irtifaq refers to adopting convenient ways, helping devices, beneficial methods, useful technology, and good manners in one's life. Shah Wali-Allah uses it in a special sense denoting different stage of socio-economic development of mankind. According to him, starting from simple primitive village life to an international community, the socio-economic development of human society can be divided into four stages. The first stage is dominated by simple economic struggle while the last stage is developed to maintain just political order on international level, to safeguard the socioeconomic interests of different states and establish peace and justice among them. All economic ideas of Shah Wali-Allah are related, in some way or the other, to his concept of irtifaqat or stages of socio-economic development. We will examine his economic ideas under different stages.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37013196, "asset_id": 11495578, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

The reasons for this neglect are complicated. Beyond (non-negligible) methodological constraints and difficulties in attaining access to some orders not open to outsiders, a double marginalization is observable. In addition to being located at the periphery of Southeast Asia\u2019s \u201cIslamic arc\u201d (Tagliacozzo 2013), those studying Islam in Thailand have focused on but more has been written on religiously motivated violence, and the (revivalist) Tablighi Jama\u2019at and (reformist) Salafiyyah which developed mass followings during the twentieth century, than the turuq they replaced. These range from those violently resisting Bangkok\u2019s project of assimilation in the far-south since 2014, to the revivalist Tablighi Jama\u2019at and reformist Salafiyyah that are now found throughout the country. This paper redresses such neglect by presenting a historical anthropology of Thai tariqa based on fieldwork among sufi orders in Thailand since late 2012. I begin by introducing some of the most important sufi personalities who, during the twentieth century, returned from educational sojourns in the Middle East, Java, and Kelantan, with permission (ijazah) to initiate or revive a range of sufi orders in Central Thailand (Ayutthaya and Bangkok), the Southern Thai-speaking upper south (Pang-nga Bay and Songkhla), and parts of the Malay-speaking far-south (Narathiwat). I describe ways in which orders widely distributed throughout the Muslim World such as the Qadriyyah, Shadhiliyyah, and Ahmadiyyah-Idrisiyyah, have been localized by Muslim communities in Thailand. I argue that successful doctrinal and ritual innovations are frequently championed by familiar people advocating and embodying something strange. The variety of localized global turuq that I present, challenge a number of assumptions about the cultural geography of Islamic diversity in contemporary Thailand.", "downloadable_attachments":

In this regard, Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is comparatively less priced than other fuels like  petrol and diesel. Pakistan is world\u2019s third largest consumers of CNG where 100,000 vehicles use the same  fuel. Whereas, at present Pakistan\r\nis facing its history\u2019s worst\r\n gas short falls. Multiple reasons of this crisis are reported but one of the major reasons is issuance of unlimited licenses for establishing CNG stations without developing and following any policy. Present research plans on to find out impact of CNG shortfall on socio-economic state of its consumers. For data collection, a self-administered structured questionnaire was used following a pilot testing to rectify the possible errors. Study respondents comprised of both men and women belonging to different age groups whereas main groups lied between 25 to 30 years.. Findings of study showed that CNG shortfall have a vital impact on economic condition of consumers and 100% of the respondents confirmed an additional monthly burden on their budgets from minimum PKR.1000 to above PKR.3500.Whereas findings regarding impact of this crisis on social lives of people reveals that  people are having less social gatherings, routine late arrivals at offices; restrict family affairs etc. Long queues for hours and hours consume most of productive time of working class leaving them with economic loses. Finding also reveals that government has no clear policy to encounter the situation\r\nto make people\u2019s\r\nlife easy and for a better tomorrow. However respondents think that if willing government can improve the  situation by taking measures like control line losses, explore new gas resources, reduce gas permits and  serious policy making along with strict implementation of laws.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34776418, "asset_id": 8377862, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

Followers of the shrines consider it sacred place and they perform different rituals there. The role of Sufis has been considered as intermediary who lead towards the path of God and success. Present study deployed qualitative research technique whereby data was drawn from 19 in-depth interviews at the Hazrat Mian Mir\u2019s Shrine in Lahore. Findings of the study revealed that majority of the people have strong belief upon the blessings of Sufis and they visit shrine to fulfill their social, economic, physical, and spiritual needs.

Many view it as a communal expression of gratitude and joy at the birth of the blessed Prophet and Messenger of Allah (saw); while others bring into question its validity, regarding the practice as an innovation. \r\n\r\nThis work by eminent scholar and recognised authority on Islam, Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri is a study of the permissibility of celebrating the Mawlid. In his characteristically methodical approach Dr Tahir-ul-Qadri meticulously examines references from the Quran, Hadith and opinions of early scholars to address fundamental questions pertaining to the celebration of the Mawlid: Is it a sinful deviation? Did the Prophet (saw) or companions celebrate it? Or is it permissible or even necessary manifestation of love and respect for the Holy Prophet (saw)? In a remarkably thorough and comprehensive analysis without precedent, the author examines the subject through every conceivable angle in making his case.\r\n\r\nISBN: ISBN: 978-1908229244", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32841763, "asset_id": 5837336, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2627966, "first_name": "Shahid", "last_name": "Mursaleen", "domain_name": "bham", "page_name": "ShahidMursaleen", "display_name": "Shahid Mursaleen", "profile_url": "https://bham.academia.edu/ShahidMursaleen?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2627966/2233287/2613354/s65_shahid.mursaleen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 540, "name": "Islamic Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Law?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 250021, "name": "Biography of the Prophet Muhammad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biography_of_the_Prophet_Muhammad?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 5641891, "title": "Spiritual Healing Among Q\u0101dir\u012b Sufis in Modern Hyderabad", "created_at": "2014-01-08T00:44:45.319-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5641891/Spiritual_Healing_Among_Q%C4%81dir%C4%AB_Sufis_in_Modern_Hyderabad?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_5641891", "summary": "The relationship between Sufism and healing has received considerable scholarly attention.

This article discusses the ways in which particular Sufi masters have defined and practised spiritual healing. It is based on the methods of historical anthropology, combining fieldwork with research on primary textual sources in Urdu. Findings show that most of the names and formulas employed in the methods of healing are drawn from the Qur\u2019an, that most of the healing methods are traced back to the Prophet Muhammad and based on the traditional Islamic worldview. This article argues that Sufi spiritual healing cannot be considered a \u2018folk\u2019 or \u2018vernacular\u2019 form of Islam; rather, it is better conceptualized as a practice that is part of the

motamakken) and second one is deconstructed discourse (kal\u0101m-e Maqlub). These two terms have been used by Sufis in their books. The distinguishing bases of these two discourses are the epistemic origin, source of knowledge, text content and the function of language in Sufi discourse. Constructed texts contain social concepts of Sufism and originate from a collective and ideological knowledge. Indeed they organize a group state and the language plays the role of a regulator in them. The deconstructed discourse is the second group of texts that have their roots in personal experiences and create a new imaginative and textual world. A deconstructed text, in terms of implications, is an open text that is flexible for interpretation and metaphorical pole of language dominates it, while constructed text hinders further interpretation. The article at the end shows the transformation process of Sufi prose from the constructed discourse word by word to the deconstructed discourse.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32269410, "asset_id": 5040596, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6711335, "first_name": "Mahmood", "last_name": "Fotoohi Rudmajani", "domain_name": "mashhad", "page_name": "MahmoodFotoohiRudmajani", "display_name": "Mahmood  Fotoohi Rudmajani", "profile_url": "https://mashhad.academia.edu/MahmoodFotoohiRudmajani?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6711335/2637253/19889791/s65_mahmood.fotoohi_rudmajani.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1269, "name": "Persian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persian_Literature?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3906, "name": "Literary Stylistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_Stylistics?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 5019938, "title": "A Short Glossary of Sufi Terms", "created_at": "2013-11-06T23:48:54.413-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5019938/A_Short_Glossary_of_Sufi_Terms?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_5019938", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32254271, "asset_id": 5019938, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 304383, "first_name": "Abdurrahman", "last_name": "M\u0131hc\u0131o\u011flu", "domain_name": "fatihsultan", "page_name": "AbdurrahmanM\u0131hc\u0131o\u011flu", "display_name": "Abdurrahman M\u0131hc\u0131o\u011flu", "profile_url": "https://fatihsultan.academia.edu/AbdurrahmanM%C4%B1hc%C4%B1o%C4%9Flu?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/304383/61343/38874795/s65_abdurrahman.m_hc_o_lu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30571, "name": "Islamic Mysticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Mysticism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 35080, "name": "Sufism in the Formative Period", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism_in_the_Formative_Period?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1011913, "name": "Early Islamic Mysticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Islamic_Mysticism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 4986202, "title": "Mapping the Esoteric Body in the Islamic Yoga of Bengal", "created_at": "2013-11-04T03:38:40.719-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4986202/Mapping_the_Esoteric_Body_in_the_Islamic_Yoga_of_Bengal?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_4986202", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32231134, "asset_id": 4986202, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2005123, "first_name": "Shaman", "last_name": "Hatley", "domain_name": "um-boston", "page_name": "ShamanHatley", "display_name": "Shaman Hatley", "profile_url": "https://um-boston.academia.edu/ShamanHatley?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2005123/669398/830837/s65_shaman.hatley.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4104, "name": "Yoga", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yoga?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17239, "name": "Indian Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Sufism?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 507727, "name": "Bengal studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bengal_studies?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 4655878, "title": "Muzaffar Alam, The Languages of Political Islam in India, New Delhi: Permanent Black, in Biblio, New Delhi, 2005, vol.

Certain Sufi shrines (darg\u0101h) of the Deccan are especially renowned for healing dreams and they attract many pilgrims and sick people, even among the non-Muslims, who reside there in order to incubate healing dreams. Therapeutic dreams derive and imitate several themes, emblems and operations from Islamic dream symbolism and from the ritualism of the Sufi darg\u0101h. The dominant models of these healing dreams among the pilgrims of the Deccan darg\u0101h appear above all to be reproductions of traditional symbolic themes of saints and their cult, with the same heroes, places and rituals. These traditional symbols shape the themes of the healing dreams, and at the same time, the visions of the believers act as a powerful means by which the saint cult tradition may endure and confirm its authority and that of its symbols of spiritual power.

It contains the teachings and works of Hadrat Khawajah Mu`inuddin Chishti Ajmeri (Allah's mercy be on him). His way of teaching was by living examples and with reference to the Holy Qur'an and Sunnah. \n\nIn an assembly in which there were present Shaykh Jalal (Allah's mercy be on him) and Hadrat Muhammad Wahid Chishti (Allah's mercy be on him). Khawajah Sahib (Allah's mercy be on him) said: Looking at five things is an act of worship in Islam. Those are, first; To visit one's parents in the morning and pay salam to them. To see one's children with love and affection. The Messenger of Allah (Peace and blessings of Allah 22 be upon him) said: Children who pay a visit to their parents for the pleasure and nearness of Allah they get the reward of the performance of a Hajj. Children who kiss the feet of their parents a reward of a thousand years worship is written in the Deed- Sheets and they are forgiven. Khawajah Sahib (Allah's mercy be on him) then narrated the following story: Once a person saw in his dream a young person who had died sinful, strolling in the Paradise among the Hajis and he was wonderstruck seeing that event and asked that young person as to how he attained that rank while the fact was that you had not done any good act while living in the world. He replied: Yes, It was true but I had my old mother. Whenever I used to go out of my home I used to lay my head on her feet and then kissed them and then used to go out. My mother prayed for me: May God grant you forgiveness and grant you the reward of Hajj. Allah Almighty accepted the supplication of my mother and granted me forgiveness and joined me in the Hajis. \n\nThereafter Khawajah Sahib (Allah's mercy be on him) said: A person asked Khawajah Ba Yazid Bustami (Allah's mercy be on him): \"How you got this wealth?\" He replied: \"When I was only a child of seven years I used to learn the Holy Qur'an from my teacher in a mosque. When I reached the verse: \"wa bil-walidayni 'ihsana\". I asked the meaning of this verse from my teacher. He said: \" Allah Almighty has commanded the children to serve their parents goodly. As I am your nourisher so have they nourished you.\" \n\nWhen I heard this from my teacher I hurriedly came to my mother and laid my head on the shoes of my mother and submitted: \"0 My Mother! Today, I have learnt the meaning of a verse of the Holy Qur'an from my teacher and have immediately come to you and have put my head to your feet in complete submission and have obeyed the command of Allah. Now by the command of Allah Almighty I am sincere servant of you. Kindly accept me in your service.\" \n\nHearing this my parents were much impressed and both of them offered two rak`ats of Nafl prayers in thanks-giving to Allah Almighty and holding my hand and facing toward the heaven said to me : \"We have entrusted you to Allah Almighty\". \n\nHence all that you see now is the good reward of the prayers of my parents. Khawajah Ba Yazid Bustami (Allah's mercy be on him) also stated: In winter season my mother asked for water. I filled the glass and put it on my hand and took it to her but she had by the time gone to sleep. When at the end of the night she got up she saw me standing with the glass and extended her hand to take it from me but as it was winter and due to severe cold the glass had sticked to my hand and when she picked up the glass the skin of my palm also separated. My mother took me into her lap with great affection and kissed my face and said: O the life of mother! You have undergone much hardship. Then she prayed for me saying: O Allah Almighty! Forgive him and bless him and grant him Thy nearness. This prayer of my mother which she had made in a state of great love and affection was accepted by Almighty and blessed me with countless favours. \n\nKhawajah Sahib (Allah's mercy be on him) said the second thing is that to see in the Holy Qur'an is an act of worship. It is mentioned in Sharh Auliya that whosoever will see and recite the Holy Qur'an Allah Almighty rewards him two fold. One is of the seeing of the Holy Qur'an and the other is the recitation of the Holy Qur'an and for every word recited by the reader he is rewarded with ten virtues and he is purified of ten evils. Thereafter he said: After the death of Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, he was seen in a dream and was asked as to how was he dealt with by Allah Almighty. He replied: One night I was a guest in the house of a friend of mine. The Holy Qur'an was lying in a small cupboard. I considered it disrespect of the Holy Qur'an to sleep in a place where there was kept the Holy Qur'an and intended to send the Holy Qur'an outside that room but again it struck to my heart that to separate the Holy Qur'an for the sake of my own comfort is also a disrespect. So I proposed to go to sleep in some other place. This act of mine was accepted in the Divine Court and I was forgiven for the respect I showed for the Holy Qur'an. \n\nThereafter Khawajah Sahib (Allah's mercy be on him) said: It is mentioned in Jami'uI-Hikayat that in the past period there was a young man indulged in acts of transgression (fisq and fujur). Muslims were much worried about him but he did not pay any heed to any advice. When he died a saint saw him in dream wearing a crown on his head and wearing a golden belt on his waste and very valuable dress . Angels were ordered to take him into the Paradise. The said asked him: How you got this blessing. He replied: Throughout my life I did .only one good thing. When I used to see the Holy Qur'an I used to stand as a mark of respect to it and paid a full of respect glance toward it. Only for showing respect to the Holy Qur'an Allah Almighty forgave all my sins and granted me this rank. \n\nThen Khawajah Sahib (Allah's mercy be on him) said that the third thing is that a person who looks towards the face of a learned pious person with respect Allah Almighty creates an angel who prays for the forgiveness of such person till the Day of Resurrection. \n\nThen Khawajah Sahib (Allah's mercy be on him) said: A heart having friendship for the learned person Allah Almighty blesses him with reward of a thousand years virtues. If he dies during that period Allah Almighty grants him the rank of the learned and his station is the 'Illiyyin. \n\nThen Khawajah Sahib (Allah's mercy be on him) said: I have seen a saying of the Messenger of Allah (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Fatawa Zahiriyyah that maximum effort should be made to pay a visit to the auliya-i-kiram and 'ulama-i-kiram. If this is done for seven days then Allah Almighty forgives all his sins and virtues of seven thousand years are recorded in his deed sheet provided that such a person observes fast in the day and stands in prayer in the night in remembrance of Allah. \n\nThen Khawajah Sahib (Allah's mercy be on him) said: In past days there had been a person who used to turn his face away when ever he happened to see any of the Masha'ikh and used to express severe jealous attitude. He died. When he was laid into the grave and wanted to turn his face to Qiblah but it could not be done despite all efforts and his face turned other side. People were wonder-struck. A voice came from the unseen: Why you people are worried about this person. He is the person who used to turn his face away whenever he saw 'ulama\u2019 and masha'ikh. Thus who so turns his face from my auliya he is deprived of my mercy and went astray. Such a person will get up in the form of a bear on the day of Resurrection. \n\nThen Khawajah Sahib (Allah's mercy be on him) said: The fourth thing is to see the Door of Ka 'bah Sharif and to see Ka'bah Sharif is also an act of worship. The Messenger of Allah (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: To go with the intention to see Khana-i-Ka'bah is an act of worship. One who sees Khanah Ka'bah he is rewarded with the rewards of Hajj and a thousand years worship and such a person is counted among 'auliya. \n\nThen Khawajah Sahib (Allah's mercy be on him) said: \"The fifth thing is to see the face one's own murshid and to remain engaged in his service is an act of worship.\" Hadrat Khawajah 'Uthman Haruni (Allah's mercy be on him) referring the book Ma'rifatul-Muridin said: A person who even for a single day serves his murshid in a befitting manner, then Allah Almighty grants him a thousand palaces, made of pearls, in Paradise. In each Palace Horas will be at his service and on the Day of Judgment he will enter Paradise without any reckoning.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 14646069, "asset_id": 1584129, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1615015, "first_name": "Munir", "last_name": "Mughal", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MunirMughal", "display_name": "Munir Mughal", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MunirMughal?f_ri=17239", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1615015/2802741/3268631/s65_munir.mughal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 491757, "name": "Mu'inuddin Chishti, Ajmeri, Khawaja", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muinuddin_Chishti_Ajmeri_Khawaja?f_ri=17239", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 1581761, "title": "Islamic Culture", "created_at": "2012-05-22T05:58:09.389-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1581761/Islamic_Culture?f_ri=17239", "dom_id": "work_1581761", "summary": "Culture is the development of human capabilities and way of action and their expression in the environment. Art and literature are not culture; rather they are the means of culture. In Islamic Culture, Islamic values reflect. In the name of art and culture, does not encourage any open or secret obscenity. It declares such act as explicitly unlawful. Similarly an act which is against human development and dignity is not allowed in Islam. Islam has its own values in which it moulds the human behaviour. If we observe the things around us, this fact becomes apparent that there is no disintegration in the universe nor any differences and disintegration in its components. Rather all this is engaged in accomplishment of some specific objective with full coordination and cooperation. To know the objective of creation, serves as the beginning of the knowledge of the values. According to the Holy Qur\u2019an the appearance of the man on the earth is not futile nor an accidental affair in the natural evolution. The Holy Qur\u2019an has clearly stated the object of the creation of Adam. The angels were in the beginning wonder struck that a creation of the nature of man will shed blood on the earth and create disorder and they wanted to know why man was being created. \n\nAllah Almighty informed that He was going to appoint a vicegerent on the earth. Thus the concept of vicegerency is of highest value in Islam. Being the vice gerent of God, a human being is responsible to pay the rights of people without any lack of care. To enable him to discharge this duty all that is in the heaven and the earth was subdued for men, i.e., he was blessed with the capability to harness and control them and thereafter bring them into their use. He was made to understand the good and the evil and their consequences. It was also made clear that the purpose of creation was to judge whose performance was the most excellent internally as well as externally. Thus the right path was shown and till the last day the model for human beings is the lifestyle of the Messenger of Allah (\u0635\u0644\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u0644\u06c1 \u0639\u0644\u06cc\u06c1 \u0648 \u0622\u0644\u06c1 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645). The Holy Qur\u2019an is the last and complete code of life and the world was shown by practical demonstration this truth. In one word, it is justice and fairplay in all words and deeds which have been termed as Islamic Culture.\n\nNote: Downloadable document in Urdu.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 14548181,
