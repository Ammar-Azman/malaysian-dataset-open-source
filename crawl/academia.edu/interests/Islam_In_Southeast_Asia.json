earthquake and tsunami of modern times in December 2004, and a long-running separatist conflict that rent Indonesia for most of its independent history. Although this book emerged from the process of recovery from those traumas, it turns the spotlight on a more positive and neglected claim Aceh has on our attention, as the Southeast Asian maritime state that most successfully and creatively maintained its independent place in the world until 1874. Like Burma, Siam and Vietnam, all better protected by geography, Aceh has its own story to tell of a unique culture struggling for survival through the European colonial era.\r\nUnfortunately the sources for this story are scattered, since Aceh\u2019s own records have not well survived the ravages of climate, civil war and eventual foreign conquest. To recover its cosmopolitan history an unparalleled range of sources and skills had to be brought together. Aceh\u2019s central role in the creation of Malay literature out of Arabic, Persian, Indian and Indonesian elements had to be explored with reference to texts surviving in a dozen world libraries (Teuku Iskandar, Amirul Hadi). The rich archeological record, neglected through the long years of conflict, had again to be brought into play (Daniel Perret), and the extensive relations of the Aceh sultanate with the Ottoman Empire (Ismail G\u00f6ksoy and Ismail Kad\u0131, Andrew Peacock & Annabel Gallop), Portugal (Jorge Alves), England (Annabel Gallop), and the Netherlands (Sher Banu and Jean Taylor) had to be explored, chiefly in European archives by experts in these respective fields.

In order to restrict somewhat the huge geographical area and timeframe covered here, we have decided to exclude the places where Islam spread through military conquest in the seventh and eighth centuries, i.e. the Middle East, Iran, Sindh and the southwestern regions of Central Asia. 1 We thus focus on three broad regions where the spread of Islam mainly followed major trade routes: Central Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia. In these three regions, Sufism, the mystical branch of Islam, figured prominently in the early diffusion of the new religion and was almost universally practiced by local Muslims until the late nineteenth century. As opposed to the central lands of Islam, in these eastern regions, Islam generally spread peacefully through trade rather than through military conquest and these shared Islamisation patterns form the main thread of this chapter. First, we deal with the general trends common to the three regions. Second, we detail the particular political and social chronology of Islamisation along the continental and maritime branches of the Silk Road.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57468669, "asset_id": 37497583, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 38526501, "first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Wormser", "domain_name": "inalco", "page_name": "PaulWormser", "display_name": "Paul  Wormser", "profile_url": "https://inalco.academia.edu/PaulWormser?f_ri=640416", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/38526501/12743924/14174221/s65_paul.wormser.jpg_oh_17db1afdb332f27370b9a40cacda0a9f_oe_57a85d17"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13098, "name": "Islam in Central Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Central_Asia?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15800, "name": "Islamic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_History?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21211, "name": "Islam in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_South_Asia?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 640416, "name": "Islam In Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_In_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=640416"}]}, {"id": 1520971, "title": "Faith on the Move: Instide of the Ijtima' of Jama'at Tabligh in Pekan Baru", "created_at": "2012-04-23T14:01:28.765-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1520971/Faith_on_the_Move_Instide_of_the_Ijtima_of_Jamaat_Tabligh_in_Pekan_Baru?f_ri=640416", "dom_id": "work_1520971", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 12338756, "asset_id": 1520971, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 665041, "first_name": "Kamaruzzaman", "last_name": "Bustamam-Ahmad", "domain_name": "ar-raniry", "page_name": "KamaruzzamanBustamamAhmad", "display_name": "Kamaruzzaman Bustamam-Ahmad", "profile_url": "https://ar-raniry.academia.edu/KamaruzzamanBustamamAhmad?f_ri=640416", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/665041/235397/7164916/s65_kamaruzzaman.bustamam-ahmad.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 107945, "name": "Islamic Movement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Movement?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 640416, "name": "Islam In Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_In_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 8899775, "title": "El islam en Filipinas (siglos X-XIX), Alicante, Universidad de Alicante, 2011.", "created_at": "2014-10-21T20:17:29.398-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8899775/El_islam_en_Filipinas_siglos_X_XIX_Alicante_Universidad_de_Alicante_2011?f_ri=640416", "dom_id": "work_8899775", "summary": "El presente estudio tiene como objetivo principal explicar la historia del islam en el archipi\u00e9lago filipino desde las propias coordenadas isl\u00e1micas y dentro del fen\u00f3meno de la expansi\u00f3n isl\u00e1mica en el mundo.

Post-independence Singapore\u2019s experience of localisation of Islam is largely through a centralised Muslim religious authority created by legislation drawn from Singapore\u2019s colonial legacy.  Policies and religious rulings of the central authority through the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) and the Fatwa Committee have significantly contributed to the Muslim community\u2019s adaptation to Singapore\u2019s urbanisation and multicultural society. I argue that as the evolving context becomes more complex in the future. Singapore\u2019s centralised approach will require further adaptation. It cannot depend merely on reactive changes to state-directed policies, laws and regulations. It must be complemented with a more proactive, robust and organic approach where there is a thorough assessment of the changing conditions and deliberate critical re-evaluation of religious tradition conditioned by a vibrant discursive tradition within the community.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62864932, "asset_id": 42657522, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 879669, "first_name": "Zalman", "last_name": "Ali", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ZalmanAli", "display_name": "Zalman Ali", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ZalmanAli?f_ri=640416", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/879669/318899/21025102/s65_zalman.ali.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 88710, "name": "Localisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Localisation?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 126943, "name": "Religion and State, Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_State_Singapore?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 251866, "name": "Waqf Role in Urban Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Waqf_Role_in_Urban_Development?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 252358, "name": "Islamic Religious Authority", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Religious_Authority?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 640416, "name": "Islam In Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_In_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=640416"}]}, {"id": 10107039, "title": "Salafi Ulama in UMNO: Political Convergence or Expediency", "created_at": "2015-01-11T00:33:17.816-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10107039/Salafi_Ulama_in_UMNO_Political_Convergence_or_Expediency?f_ri=640416", "dom_id": "work_10107039", "summary": "The Salafi ulama (religious scholars) in Malaysia have seen their\r\nreligious and political influence amplified over the last five years. Operating within a newly formed organization, the Pertubuhan IlmuwanMalaysia (ILMU) and the newly augmented United Malays National\r\nOrganization\u2019s (UMNO) young ulama wing, Salafi scholars play a key role in providing Islamic legitimacy to the government and defending it against the opposition Islamist party, the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). The decision by Salafi scholars to support the Malaysian government is striking given their hardline views on the implementation of Islamic laws and their opposition to democracy. This paper seeks to understand the reasons for the Salafi ulama\u2019s support for UMNO. It argues that the Salafi ulama\u2019s involvement in UMNO is due to a convergence of interest between the two groups and as part of a strategy by the Salafi ulama to expand their influence at both the state and societal levels. The paper examines the religious-political positions of the Salafi ulama on issues such as the Islamic state, the implementation of Islamic laws and democratic political system, and argues that they are opposed to the current state of religious affairs and the political structure of the Malaysian state. Nevertheless, the\r\nulama are working within UMNO to change the political system. For  UMNO leaders, the Salafi ulama form an important group that could defend the party against religious attacks from PAS and provide the party with greater religious credence.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36226672, "asset_id": 10107039, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 245699, "first_name": "Mohamed", "last_name": "Nawab", "domain_name": "berkeley", "page_name": "MohamedNawab", "display_name": "Mohamed Nawab", "profile_url": "https://berkeley.academia.edu/MohamedNawab?f_ri=640416", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/245699/262590/310283/s65_mohamed.nawab.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 88513, "name": "Salafism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Salafism?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 110268, "name": "Salafi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Salafi?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 169060, "name": "Salafi-Jihadi Ideology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Salafi-Jihadi_Ideology?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 215664, "name": "Political Islam in Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam_in_Malaysia?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 252364, "name": "Contemporary Salafism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Salafism?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 393006, "name": "Islamic Party of Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Party_of_Malaysia?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 640416, "name": "Islam In Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_In_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=640416"}]}, {"id": 15213907, "title": "\u02bfAbd al-Samad in Arabia: The Yemeni Years of a Shaykh from Sumatra", "created_at": "2015-08-26T21:27:37.439-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15213907/%CA%BFAbd_al_Samad_in_Arabia_The_Yemeni_Years_of_a_Shaykh_from_Sumatra?f_ri=640416", "dom_id": "work_15213907", "summary": "This paper provides an in-depth exploration of a previously under-utilized Arabic source for the history of Islam in Southeast Asia.

Through a close, annotated reading of that text this article develops new insights into the configuration of people and ideas populating specific nodes of trans-regional networks in Sumatra and Arabia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. At the same time, it also brings to light important dimensions of Sufi belief and ritual practice during this important transi- tional period of Islamic history in Southeast Asia.

The argu- ment is that the Malay kerajaan of Patani was similar to\u2014rather than distinct from\u2014other port city-states on the peninsula and islands of Southeast Asia where a Sanskrit cosmopolis existed for a millennium before the earliest chapters of Islam\u2019s Southeast Asian expansion. Islam also circulated east and west of Patani through trade between the Middle East and China via the Indian Ocean. This created a range of Indian/Arab/Malay creole communities whose members played key roles in the adoption of, or adhesion to, Islam in Southeast Asian port city-states like Patani. India\u2019s importance to the arrival of Islam to the Thai/Malay peninsula relates to what Islam came to, where Islam initially came from, and who Islam came through. Rather than refer to conversion, I refer to an adhesion to, or adoption of, Islam. The impact of Thai and Islamic influences in Patani/Pattani following its defeat in 1785 is described. The details of the process through which the Malay Kingdom (SM. kerajaan) of   became the Thai Province of Pattani, including Bangkok\u2019s legislative and administrative initiatives are also provided. A central con- cern of this chapter is to highlight the fact that these developments coincided with a period of revolution and reform in the Hijaz. I describe how these developments impacted local religious life and thought through local luminaries such as Shaykh Daud Al-Fatani, Shaykh Ahmad Al-Fatani and Haji Sulong. The methodologies and contributions of present-day reformist revivalist movements are also described.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33674643, "asset_id": 7014095, "asset_type": "Work",

Pour jeter un \u00e9clairage diff\u00e9rent sur cette p\u00e9riode d'\u00e9changes intellectuels, nous \u00e9voquerons ici la rencontre de l'Inde et de l'Egypte non pas chez un auteur de M\u00e9dine, mais chez un auteur malais appel\u00e9 N\u016brudd\u012bn ar-R\u0101n\u012br\u012b (c.1590-1658), ayant exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 Aceh, sur l'\u00eele de Sumatra, \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 Nord-Ouest de l'Indon\u00e9sie actuelle, au milieu du XVII e si\u00e8cle. Quand nous parlerons de traditions intellectuelles \u00ab indiennes \u00bb chez cet auteur, ce sera n\u00e9anmoins dans un sens un peu particulier, puisqu'il ne s'agira ni de la tradition hindoue en langue sanskrite, ni de la tradition soufie en langue persane, mais d'auteurs soufis \u00e9crivant directement en arabe, le plus souvent d'origine arabe et ayant v\u00e9cu en Inde, dans les provinces c\u00f4ti\u00e8res du Gujarat et du Deccan. Pour \u00e9tudier la transmission et l'adaptation de ces oeuvres \u00e9gyptiennes et indiennes dans le monde malais, nous d\u00e9couvrirons ce que deviennent ces oeuvres une fois traduites en malais ainsi que leur influence et leur r\u00e9ception dans ce nouvel environnement. Dans un premier temps, nous pr\u00e9senterons bri\u00e8vement la vie et l'oeuvre de N\u016brudd\u012bn al-R\u0101n\u012br\u012b. Puis, nous mettrons en \u00e9vidence les influences \u00e9gyptiennes et indiennes dans son oeuvre et dans sa d\u00e9marche intellectuelle.

I argue that a combination of elite ideology and regime type can explain the state\u2019s overall stances on religion, including the hijab issue. Previously, when the state was hegemonic, its policies were determined solely by the ideologies held by its key elites. However, as the state moves towards competitive authoritarianism with increased electoral competition, the dominant party will no longer be able to act solely based on its ideological predispositions. This explains why a staunch no-hijab stand was held by the state in the past, whereas in recent years, there appears to be a softening of this stance.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43018680, "asset_id": 22392279, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25983224, "first_name": "Walid jumblatt", "last_name": "Abdullah", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "WalidjumblattAbdullah", "display_name": "Walid jumblatt Abdullah", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/WalidjumblattAbdullah?f_ri=640416", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/25983224/7123703/12231038/s65_walid_jumblatt.abdullah.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 796, "name": "Comparative Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Politics?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 12978, "name": "Muslim Minorities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslim_Minorities?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 25845, "name": "Southeast Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Politics?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 539630, "name": "Competitive Authoritarianism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Competitive_Authoritarianism?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 640416, "name": "Islam In Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_In_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=640416"}]}, {"id": 4045364, "title": "(2013) The haj, salvation and social change in cosmopolitan Penang and Patani.

Anthropologists in Southeast Asia, particularly influenced by the anthropology of Islam, have complimented traditional interest in local ritual performances with how haj has impacted Southeast Asian Muslims and Muslim societies. This paper describes the effects of the the haj and umrah on individual salvation and social change. While the empirical data introduced in this paper is based on extensive enthnographic fieldwork undertaken in the overwhelmingly Muslim context of Pattani town (amphur muang Pattani), this paper suggests areas of continuity and disjuncture with other cosmopolitan Southeast Asian port city-states such as Penang. I argue that despite their geographical proximity, significant differences in the economic, ethnic, linguistic, and religious dynamics of these cosmopolitan centres should not be overlooked. Penang might have been the closest port of departure to Mecca for Muslims resided in the western coast of Thailand\u2019s upper south that before the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909 was part of the Kedah Kerajaan, but many Malays from Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat left for Mecca from ports on the east coast. This paper argues that a significant similarities between Patani/Pattani and Penang the absence that has has been inadequately dealt with my scholars who shares the authors interest in the Thai/Malay Peninsula is the marginalization of Malay rajas by Siamese and British colonial expansion. Given the importance of these institutions in the patronage and administering of Islam, pilgrims returning to Penang and Patani/Pattani faced different obstacles to disseminating reformist agendas encountered in the Haramyn to than those returning to contexts still within the control of the palace. Whether from Penang and Patani/Pattani, pilgrims enjoyed the personal benefits of fulfilling the fifth and final pillar of Islam and the merit received from pious performances in Mecca\u2019s potent centre, the details of which I delineate and discuss.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31582076, "asset_id": 4045364, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 667449, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Joll", "domain_name": "victoria", "page_name": "ChristopherJoll", "display_name": "Christopher M Joll", "profile_url": "https://victoria.academia.edu/ChristopherJoll?f_ri=640416", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/667449/851788/1060921/s65_cm.joll.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 792, "name": "Historical Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Anthropology?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3674, "name": "Anthropology of Pilgrimage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Pilgrimage?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3784, "name": "Pilgrimage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pilgrimage?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 7163, "name": "Pilgrimage Routes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pilgrimage_Routes?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 -

"summary": "This article proposes a new etymon for the Malay word lebai (minor religious official/scholar), namely the Sino-Muslim term libai (\u79ae\u62dc, worship or religious service conducted in a mosque). Scholars have traditionally argued that lebai, a loanword introduced during the early stages of Islamization, derives from the Tamil leppai (or lebbai), likewise signifying (amongst other things) a minor religious official/scholar. On this basis, it has been argued that Tamil Muslims acted as Southeast Asia\u2019s earliest Islamic officials. This article critically re-assesses the evidence underlying this attribution. By tracing the earliest known Malay usage of lebai to Java - where it emerged alongside Sino-Muslim influences associated with Cirebon, Gresik and Demak - the etymon libai is proposed: since the Song dynasty (960-1279), Sino-Muslims have used the noun libai as a designate for religious affairs (particularly prayers) conducted in a mosque. We suggest that lebai originates with this term, making it indicative of Sino-Muslim influence during Java\u2019s Islamization.

Malaysia today includes not only the southern part of the Malay Peninsula, but also the states of Sabah and Sarawak in the northern part of the island of Borneo. The people of Borneo are Austronesian or Malayo-Polynesian with the largest ethnic on Sabah being the Kadazandusen and on Sarawak it is the Ibans. The earliest people on the Malay peninsula were the Orang Asli,   their descendants being the Negritos, Senois, and Jakun. The Orang Asli  mixed with Mongols who had migrated south from Yunnan province in China creating the Malay ethnic group.  During the seventh and eighth centuries\nA. D. people from Sumatra (Indonesia today) and Thailand added to the mixture. During the second millennium A.D. Muslim, Arabs, and Persian introduced Islam to the peninsula. Other groups include the Minangkabaus from Sumatra, the Bugis from the Celebes (Sulawesi today), and the Champs from southern Vietnam.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s and Singapore\u2019s location along the Strait of Melaka (Malacca) made them important to trade routes between the India Ocean and the South China Sea. Indian traders introduced Buddhist and Hindu prayers and rituals to the region. In the Sumatran principality of Palembang there developed the Buddhist Srivijaya Empire circa 683 A.D. that dominated the Strait of Melaka. In the fourteenth century the kingdom Majapahit in eastern Java replaced the Srivijaya Empire, and resentment against them let to a member of the Palembang royal family named Parameswara to declare himself the leader of the Malays and the creation of the Melaka sultanate. In the 1390s Parameswara established their base on the island of Memasek (Singapore today). Later he moved his capital to the northwest port town of Melaka on the east bank so the Strait of Melaka.\n\nIn the early sixteenth century the Portuguese began to arrive. In 1511 Alfonso de Albuquerque forced the ruling family of Melaka to flee their town for the southeastern section of the Malay Peninsula, where they established the Malay kingdom of Johor. In 1580 the kingdoms of Portugal and Spain were united under the Spanish Habsburg kings. At the same time the Netherlands gained its independence from Spain and established the Dutch East India Company (VOC) to gain a foothold in the spice trade. The VOC established a trading post named Batavia (later Jakarta) the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. In 1640 Portugal left the so-called Iberian Union, and the VOC took advantage of the Portugal\u2019s split with Spain to occupy Melaka. \n\nIn the late eighteenth century, English traders began to make contact with local royal courts on the Malay Peninsula. In 1783 the Shah of Kedah, seeking protection from Siam (Thailand today) and Burma (Myanmar, today) offered an English trader a lease on Penang Island off the northwest coast of the Malay peninsula. The trader founded the town of Georgetown on the island. In 1795 the British convinced the Dutch King William, who had fled to England when the French took over the Netherlands, to allow the British to occupy Melaka. In 1819 the British East India Company signed a treaty with sultan of Johor ceding the island of Singapore to Britain. The British also occupied Melaka (Malacca) and Penang, which together became known as the Straits Settlements. The British also encouraged large numbers of Chinese and Indians to migrate to their colony. The British did not intervene in the northmost sultanates of Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan, and Terengganu that were under Siamese influence because it viewed Siam as a buffer against the French in Indochina. But in 1895 Britain annexed them to Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang to form the Federated Malay States with its capital in Kuala Lumpur. In 1946 Britain combined the Federated Malay States with the Straits Settlements (Melaka and Penang) to form the Malayan Union, which was renamed the Federation of Malaya in 1948. In 1957 the Federation of Malaya achieved its independence, and in 1963 it annexed North Borneo (Sabah today), Sarawak, and Singapore to become Malaysia. In 1965 Singapore left Malaysia to become a sovereign city-state.\n\nMalaysia and Singapore developed in different ways because of a different ethnic mixture. In Singapore 70 percent of the populations is Chinese with a minority of 13 percent Malay, 9 percent Indian. Buddhism is the largest religion with 33 percent of the population, and 24 percent Muslim. In Malaysia 69 percent of the population is Bumiputera (Malay and the indigenous ethnic groups on the island of Borneo, on 25 percent ethnic Chinese, and 7 percent Malaysian Indian. Islam is the largest religion with 61 percent of population followed by 20 percent Buddhist, and 6 percent Hindu. Ethnic Chinese make up about 25 percent of the population, and Malaysian Indian about 7 percent. The official language of Malaysia is Bahasa Malaysia, a standardized form of the Malay language. While Malaysia is technically a secular state, Islam is designated as the \u201creligion of the Federation.\u201d About 61 percent of the population is Muslim, 20 percent Buddhist, 9 percent Christian, 6 percent Hindu, and 1 percent either Confucian, Tao, or followers of other traditional Chinese religions. These demographic differences resulted in the two countries separating despite their shared history.\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65486518, "asset_id": 44948747, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1064372, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Cohen", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "httpwwwtalkinghistoryorgcohenhtml", "display_name": "David S Cohen", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/httpwwwtalkinghistoryorgcohenhtml?f_ri=640416", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1064372/427483/36885867/s65_david.cohen.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43434, "name": "Overseas Chinese", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Overseas_Chinese?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 93445, "name": "Ethnic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_History?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 323875, "name": "British East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_East_India_Company?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 640416, "name": "Islam In Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_In_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 3864515, "name": "Communism in Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communism_in_Malaysia?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 3864516, "name": "Strait of Melaka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Strait_of_Melaka?f_ri=640416"}]}, {"id": 13011827, "title": "Adat dan Idealisme dalam Pemikiran Hukum Mohamad Koesnoe", "created_at": "2015-06-15T23:39:11.060-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/13011827/Adat_dan_Idealisme_dalam_Pemikiran_Hukum_Mohamad_Koesnoe?f_ri=640416", "dom_id": "work_13011827", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37916955, "asset_id": 13011827, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 74355, "first_name": "R.

is among the earliest Javanese manuscripts brought to Europe by seafarers. It was presented to the Bodleian Library, Oxford, in 1629. Its text-titled Stories of Amir (Caritanira Amir)-sheds new light on the literary and cultural history of Java and the wider Java Sea world. Probably composed in the 1500s, possibly in Banten, the text contains part of an adaptation of the Malay Hikayat Amir Hamzah, itself a rendition of an eleventh-century text in Persian. The protagonist Hamza was an uncle of the Prophet Muhammad. His epic story used to be told across Islamic Asia in a range of literary and performance genres. The text is Javanized not only in its language but also its poetics and (selectively) its natural and cultural settings. Among other things, Caritanira Amir helps to clarify the relationship between Middle and Modern Javanese, and it problematizes social, political, and religious issues that were evidently of concern in the early modern Java Sea world.

structure of Indonesia\u2019s Islamic legal structure. The current system of Islamic courts in Indonesia is traceable to a late nineteenth century Dutch decree establishing a system of Islamic tribunals on the islands of Java and Madura. The decree created collegial courts in which a district-level religious official called the penghulu acted as chair and was assisted by member judges chosen from the local religious elite. The courts were authorized to decide matrimonial and inheritance disputes, but execution of the courts\u2019 decisions required an executory decree from the civil court. The system was expanded to south Kalimantan in the 1930s, but at the same time the jurisdiction over inheritance was transferred to the civil courts. At independence, the Islamic judiciary was placed under the authority of the Ministry of Religion, which used executive powers to expand the system to other parts of the country. It was not until 1989 with the passage of the Religious Judicature Act that the existence of the courts was guaranteed by statute. The 1989 Act also vested the courts with enforcement powers and mandated changes in the organization and staffing of the courts modeled after the parallel system of civil courts.\r\n    The substantive jurisdiction of the courts has also been expanded to include inheritance cases as well as a so far little-used power to decide cases involving economic transactions based on Islamic law. In 2004, the administrative supervision of the Islamic judiciary was transferred from the Ministry of Religion to the Supreme Court. In 1999, the province of Aceh was granted special autonomy status that included the authority to enforce Islamic law in areas beyond the established jurisdictions of Shari\u201ba courts in the rest of the country. These developments add a new dimension to the institutional structures for the practice of Islamic law in the country.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37916939, "asset_id": 13011809, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 74355, "first_name": "R.

The essays in this volume provide focused examinations of the internal dynamics of intellectual and institutional elements of Islamic law in modern Indonesia in its recent formations. The first five chapters address issues relating to Islamic legal theory, both its historical development over the past century and analysis of the work of specific groups of contemporary scholars, jurists, and activists. The final seven chapters contain studies of more concrete manifestations of Islamic law in modern Indonesia, including court systems, positive law, the drafting of new \"Islamic\" legislation, and contemporary debates over the implementation of the Shari\u2019a.

The charismatic leader of this rebellion in South Sulawesi was Qahhar Mudzakkar (also spelt \"Kahar Muzakkar\"), whose conflict with the central government and army began in 1950 when he was overlooked as commander of a special Sulawesi brigade and many of the Sulawesi guerrillas who had fought against the Dutch were discarded as the Indonesian Army restructured. Qahhar led the men into the jungle and began a rebellion that would last for 15 years. In 1953, he proclaimed an Islamic state, thus joining the Darul Islam movement. Important factors in the rebellion's genesis and momentum were bitterness at the perceived injustice and rejection of Qahhar and the Sulawesi guerrillas by the central government and army and increasing Javanese hegemony in the region. Other causal factors debated include Islam, various political ideas, and several South Sulawesi cultural concepts. What seems clear is that Qahhar had developed ideas that were seemingly incompatible with \"traditional\" notions of South Sulawesi culture. He preached a form of \"Islamic socialism,\" aimed to implement strict shari'ah law, eradicate aristocratic titles, pre-Islamic rituals, and Sufi orders. Forty-eight years after his death, Qahhar Mudzakkar continues to divide opinion and inspire new generations. The paper focuses on three main aspects of Qahhar Mudzakkar and his legacy. The first examines traditional leadership in South Sulawesi, including the cultural characteristics expected of leaders and draws comparisons with the 17th century. The second examines memories and perceptions of Qahhar and the rebellion related to me by people who lived through the period. The third looks at how Qahhar is perceived and the role he plays in modern day South Sulawesi, particularly in local politics as many see Preparatory Committee for the Application of Islamic Laws (KPPSI) as a continuation of Qahhar\u2019s struggle.\nThe head of KPPSI is Abdul Aziz Qahhar Mudzakkar, a son of Qahhar Mudzakkar.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63903193, "asset_id": 43599989, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 826780, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Druce", "domain_name": "ubd", "page_name": "StephenDruce", "display_name": "Stephen C Druce", "profile_url": "https://ubd.academia.edu/StephenDruce?f_ri=640416", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/826780/591031/56818941/s65_stephen.druce.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=640416", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28829, "name": "Indonesia (Area Studies)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia_Area_Studies_?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 30697, "name": "Islam and the State in Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_the_State_in_Indonesia?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 37193, "name": "Islam in Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Indonesia?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 50003, "name": "Indonesian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Politics?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 188347, "name": "Sulawesi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sulawesi?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 246533, "name": "Islam and Indonesian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Indonesian_Politics?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 246811, "name": "South Sulawesi History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Sulawesi_History?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 465734, "name": "Bugis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bugis?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 572794, "name": "Southeast Aisan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Aisan_Studies?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 580998, "name": "Sulawesi selatan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sulawesi_selatan?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 640416, "name": "Islam In Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_In_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 952327, "name": "Southeast Asian Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Islam?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 979770, "name": "Indonesian Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Nationalism?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 980990, "name": "Bugis Makassar History and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bugis_Makassar_History_and_Culture?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 1489678, "name": "Sejarah Sulawesi Selatan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sejarah_Sulawesi_Selatan?f_ri=640416"}, {"id": 1694182, "name": "Sejarah Islam Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sejarah_Islam_Indonesia?f_ri=640416"}]}, {"id": 13011744, "title": "Social Engineering through Shar\u012b\u02bfa: Islamic Law and State-Directed Da\u02bfwa in Contemporary Aceh", "created_at": "2015-06-15T23:35:10.406-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/13011744/Social_Engineering_through_Shar%C4%AB%CA%BFa_Islamic_Law_and_State_Directed_Da%CA%BFwa_in_Contemporary_Aceh?f_ri=640416", "dom_id": "work_13011744", "summary": "This study of the contemporary Islamic legal system in Aceh, Indonesia argues for new attention to be paid to the ways in which contemporary Muslim agendas for the implementation of Islamic law can be read as projects for future-oriented social transformation\u2014rather than as a series of reactive measures to perceived 'crises of modernity' and/or the political machinations of rival elites in contesting control of state power. In doing so it highlights the ways in which the ideals of, and institutional formations developed by, proponents of Islamic law are configured in relation to a broad range of non-Muslim modernist projects, including European and American theories of the sociology of law.

I begin by demonstrating how the local rise of Thai/Siamese influence coincided with growth of Islamic reformism. The subjugation of the Malay Kerajaan of Patani by Siamese forces between the 178Os and the 1820\u2019s led to an exodus of \u2018ulama to Mecca at a tumultuous time. The writings and returning students of Malay-Indonesian scholars based in Mecca began to challenge traditionalist orthopraxy in Pattani before Siam increased its attempts to assimilate its southern subjects following the 1909 Anglo-Siamese Treaty. The governments of General Prem Tinsulanonda negotiated an amnesty to Malay separatists, accommodated Malay demands, and co-opted Malay elites. Once more, these developments roughly coincided with Islamic resurgence. As a result, Malays in South Thailand are both more religiously observant, and engagement in Thai modernity. The second half of this paper describes the impact of these Thai and Islamic influences on merit-making rhetoric, rituals, and rationales. Malay language loss among urban Malays have led to increasing numbers referring to the generation, accumulation and transference of merit as tham bun (merit-making)\u23afan expansive Thai religious idiom. While Thai influences have impacted merit-making rhetoric, Islamic reformism has changed merit (Th. Bun, SM. Pahala) are generating. Traditionalists and reformists both insist that the performance of one\u2019s individual ritual obligations (fardu \u2018in) has the biggest effect on Muslim\u2019s comfort in the grave and eschatological vindication. Nevertheless, reformist reject the efficacy of merit transferred to the deceased (except when performed by anak saleh) have led to the circle of posthumous funeral feasts being replaced by merit-transference strategies considered consistent with the sunnah. Traditionalists argue for the efficacy of a range of merit-generating ritual complexes, and that merit-transference is a meritorious act. While Thai influences have impacted merit-making rhetoric, and Islamic influences merit-making rituals, both affect merit-making rationales. Islamic tradition emphatically affirms that one\u2019s the level of one\u2019s store of merit affects one\u2019s comfort in the grave and vindication at judgment. While Malays of South Thailand share the Indic background with other Southeast Asian Muslims, contact with Theravada Buddhism can be seen to have led to a greater emphasis on, and more sophisticated conception of, the economy of merit in South Thailand.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 29561199, "asset_id": 2042640, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

These changes have involved not only the emergence of distinctly new profiles of leadership, but also the persistence and adaptation of the models established by the ulama of the classical period. The challenges of modernizing reform at the turn of the twentieth century struck at the very heart of traditions that had bolstered established religious authority for a thousand years. In the modern period, ulama find themselves in increasingly crowded and highly contested public spheres in which they can no longer hold any kind of monopoly. Contemporary debates in Muslim public spheres are characterized by the emergence of complex new discursive formulations on issues of religious belief and practice, individual rights and responsibilities, and proper standards of public morality. This special issue explores diverse models of Muslim religious authority in modern Asia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37920623, "asset_id": 13010379, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 74355, "first_name": "R.

During this period as the Malaysian state constructed its national identity and plotted its policy course, the role of Islam and religious leaders became an important point of debate. It is within this context that this article considers the independence and autonomy of Malaysian Muslim religious leaders. Traditional religious authority in Malaysia finds its underpinnings largely in the institutions of Islamic learning locally known as pondoks, which are a community of students of Islam under the directions of a religious leader, ulama (also often known as a Tok Guru). However as the state consolidated their control over these religious leaders whom were co-opted into the state apparatus, by employment and education at state universities, their social significance has been destabilized. In the wake of this compromised socio-political and religious position alternative sources of authoritative Islamic teachings have emerged in recent years such as the Tablighi Jama\u02bfat discussed in this article.

It does this through a critical examination of the workings of the state shari'a system as it was designed and implemented at the turn of the twenty-first century in Aceh, Indonesia. While the empirical details of these discussions are unique, this particular case presents a remarkable site for investigating the broader issue of the impact of instrumentalist, future-oriented visions of Islamic law on modern Muslim calls for the state implementation of Islamic law. In post-tsunami/post-conflict Aceh, the idea of shari'a as an exercise in social engineering was amplified through resonance with an increasingly pervasive rhetoric of 'total reconstruction'. \r\n\r\nBased upon extensive fieldwork as well as critical readings of a wide range of archival materials, official documents, and local publications this work focuses on the institutions and actors involved with this contemporary project for the state implementation of Islamic law. The individual chapters are structured to deal with the major components of this system to critically examine how these institutions have taken shape and how they work. It also shows how the overall system was informed not only by aspects of late twentieth-century da'wa discourses of Islamic reform, but also modern trends in sociological jurisprudence and the impact of global models of disaster relief, reconstruction, and development.

poorly understood. A perception even persists amongst some scholars that the region does not constitute fertile ground for the archaeologist, with its high humidity destroying valuable remains. This chapter, however, demonstrates that Southeast Asia is home to a fascinating array of early Islamic artifacts. Focusing on the sites of four early Southeast Asian Islamic kingdoms, namely Barus, Lambri, Samudera-Pasai, and Brunei, this chapter considers their archaeology in the context of recent claims that Muslims from China were involved in the region's Islamization. Consonant with conversion, the chapter demonstrates that all four locations did indeed experience a connection of some sort with China. Most notably, all the sites (except Samudera-Pasai, for which no systematic ceramic evidence is available) yielded considerable amounts of Chinese pottery, pre-modern China's principal export item. Three of the sites, Lambri, Samudera-Pasai, and Brunei, also witnessed the utilization of numerous Chinese artistic motifs in association with their earliest Islamic artifacts. Most strikingly, however, Brunei provides strong evidence not only of a much earlier sultanate than previously suspected but also of a direct connection with the major Chinese port of Quanzhou. While continually stressing that the presence of Chinese trade items and/or cultural influences does not establish a Chinese (Muslim or otherwise) presence at the examined locations, they do demonstrate that Southeast Asia's first Muslim kingdoms emerged within an environment suffuse with Chinese trade goods and at a time when Chinese cultural influences were being freely adopted by the local Muslim population.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65570639, "asset_id": 44563433, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1158737, "first_name":

It is within this context that this article considers the independence and autonomy of Malaysian Muslim religious leaders. Traditional religious authority in Malaysia finds its underpinnings largely in the institutions of Islamic learning locally known as pondoks, which are a community of students of Islam under the directions of a religious leader, ulama (also often known as a Tok Guru). However as the state consolidated their control over these religious leaders whom were co-opted into the state apparatus, by employment and education at state universities, their social significance has been destabilized.

Humanizing the Sacred demonstrates how Sunni women activists in Malaysia are fracturing institutionalized Islamic authority by generating new understandings of rights and redefining the moral obligations of their community. Based on ethnographic research of Sisters in Islam (SIS), a nongovernmental organization of professional women promoting justice and equality, Basarudin examines SIS members' involvement in the production and transmission of Islamic knowledge to reformulate legal codes and reconceptualize gender discourses. By weaving together women's lived realities, feminist interpretations of Islamic texts, and Malaysian cultural politics, this book illuminates how a localized struggle of claiming rights takes shape within a transnational landscape. It provides a vital understanding of how women \"live\" Islam through the integration of piety and reason and the implications of women's political activism for the transformation of Islamic tradition itself.\n\nSelect Reviews: \n\u2022The Muslim World, 108, July 2018\n\u2022The Journal of Asian Studies 76(02), May 2017, 565-567 \n\u2022Religion and Gender, 7(2), December 2017,

publication in 1922, two Islamic inscriptions formed an essential basis of the early history of Islam in Champa. Recently, however, they have been shown to have originated, not from Southeast Asia, but from Tunisia. It is clear that there was either an error regarding their provenance, or it was deliberately falsified. The implications of this are discussed, and the remaining evidence of early Islamic presence in Champa is reassessed. It is suggested that there is now no good evidence of any Islamic presence there until after the sixteenth century. In relation to this issue, the maritime links between China and the Islamic world are examined, as also are other possible examples of falsification of history. In the context of maritime links, sailing times and periods for the routes across the Indian Ocean and South China Sea are analysed. It is concluded that it was impossible to make the return journey between anywhere in Arabia and southern China in less than two years. A short addendum to this paper also points out that there is an anachronism in the tomb inscription of Yang Liangyao,  strong evidence that the inscription is a forgery.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1820034, "first_name": "Stephen G.", "last_name": "Haw", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "StephenHaw", "display_name": "Stephen G.
