While concerns about the ageing approach mount, no unified alternative framework has emerged. Informed by Brubaker\u2019s work on \u2018groupism\u2019, we provide an account of the currently dominant approach and outline an alternative vision of social divisions, exclusion and inclusion. More specifically, we offer a framework that can help researchers consider easing away from ethnic reification (as well as from the attendant analytic promotion of highly subjective notions such as \u2018ethnic groups\u2019) and towards analyses founded on more objective, \u2018first-order\u2019 social scientific categories. Making use of Elias\u2019s work on established and outsider dynamics, and dealing substantively with education, we flesh out how an alternative approach to in- and exclusion in contemporary Dutch society might be put to use. The goal, in short, is to assist researchers interested in a path leading to more grounded, relational and processual approaches to integration.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35056965, "asset_id": 8705208, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 18265398, "first_name": "Bowen", "last_name": "Paulle", "domain_name": "uva", "page_name": "BowenPaulle", "display_name": "Bowen Paulle", "profile_url": "https://uva.academia.edu/BowenPaulle?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18265398/5110144/5857097/s65_bowen.paulle.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9214, "name": "Essentialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Essentialism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 99915, "name": "Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Integration?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 169804, "name": "The Netherlands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Netherlands?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 49049179, "title": "Gypsy Music \u2013 Romani Jazz Patterns of the Cultural Heritage and Social Status of Gypsy Musicians", "created_at": "2021-05-26T08:45:13.492-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49049179/Gypsy_Music_Romani_Jazz_Patterns_of_the_Cultural_Heritage_and_Social_Status_of_Gypsy_Musicians?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_49049179", "summary": "Ever since jazz appeared in Hungary in the 1920s, it has entered an interaction with Gypsymusic of the coffee houses, which has been practised by the Romani minority as an urban, folkloristic, popular style of music. Instances when the Romani came across jazz, viewed from a historical angle, provide excellent examples of the complex ways Gypsy musicians related to the urban culture of different times. As in French and German-speaking countries, Roma and Sinti entertainment musicians in Hungary embraced jazz and transmitted it to their audience alongside the local repertoire. We believe that it is necessary to look into issues of history, society, (popular) culture, aesthetics, musicology, etc. in order to provide valid answers by Romani studies and jazz studies. From the viewpoint of interdisciplinary jazz studies, Gypsy musicians appear in a number of crucially important contexts, so that studies examining the social situation of the Roma and cultural science-based jazz studies may complement each other ideally and together they may be able to produce fruitful knowledge for both fields. The conference is aiming at this kind of synthesis by expecting talks exploringthe relation of the Gypsy/Roma to music and to jazz in the sphere of their own disciplines. There has been a certain ambivalence concerning the social acceptance of Gypsy music ever since the days of Ferenc Liszt whose book on the subject was based on false assumptions while his compositions truly elevated this music. Since then, a lot of scholarly and amateur works have been published, but there are some unanswered questions left. We are convinced that through the opportunities provided by the conference Hungarian researchers could play an inspiring role in the international scientific work to come on these subjects.\nThe conference will be held in Hungarian and English.

Focusing on the cultural, legal, and scientific controversy over Kennewick Man, the ancient human remains discovered in Washington state in 1996, the article explores the narrative politics of American national belonging. Through a popular historical novel on Kennewick Man's life, the article further theorizes nostalgia as a narrative tool in imagining the evolutionary origins of the nation. The article argues that nostalgia produces a temporal dynamic that bridges the gap between national history and global prehistory, and that this dynamic is reinforced through cultural ideas of genetic knowledge. At the same time, prehistoric nostalgia renders problematic ideas of ethnic difference largely invisible.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40205931, "asset_id": 5965930, "asset_type": "Work",

Oregon. Expanded access for private oil, gas, mining, and logging industries and the downsizing of national monuments such as Bears Ears lead by Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke. A number of highly contentious debates and sensationalized events have again focused attention on land held in the public domain by the United States. This essay argues that federal land policy as a form of colonial administration has been constitutive for the logic of expectation as property in what is now the United States. From the state land cessions negotiated on behalf of the Articles of Confederation to the preemption acts (1830\u20131841) to the homestead acts (1862\u20131916) to present-day demands for land transfer, the acquisition and disposal of the so-called public domain have been central to westward colonization, the consolidation of the nation-state, and the promise of land ownership as the ostensible foundation of individual liberty. These dynamics are evident in contemporary conflicts over public lands and arguments for the transfer of public lands to either state or private ownership. Approaching the Bundy occupations as flashpoints that illuminate competing interpretations and claims to land within the history of westward colonization, this essay seeks to demonstrate the ways in which expectation emerges from particular economies of dispossession of indigenous peoples that have historically worked through and across the division of public and private property.",

In Crossing the Color Line, Carina E. Ray goes beyond this fact to reveal how Gold Coasters\u2014their social practices, interests, and anxieties\u2014shaped and defined these powerfully charged relations across racial lines. The interplay between African and European perspectives and practices, argues Ray, transformed these relationships into key sites for consolidating colonial rule and for contesting its racial and gendered hierarchies of power.\r\n\r\nWith rigorous methodology and innovative analyses, Ray brings Ghana and Britain into a single analytic frame by examining cases in both locales. Intimate relations between black men and white women in Britain\u2019s port cities emerge as an influential part of the history of interracial sex and empire in ways that are connected to rather than eclipsed by relations between European men and African women in the colony.\r\n\r\nBased on rich archival evidence and original interviews, the book moves across different registers, shifting from the micropolitics of individual disciplinary cases against colonial officers who \u201ckept\u201d local women to transatlantic networks of family, empire, and anticolonial resistance. In this way, Ray cuts to the heart of how interracial sex became a source of colonial anxiety and nationalist agitation during the first half of the twentieth century.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37574817, "asset_id": 12286293, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13280, "first_name": "Carina", "last_name": "Ray", "domain_name": "umich", "page_name": "CarinaRay", "display_name": "Carina Ray", "profile_url": "https://umich.academia.edu/CarinaRay?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13280/4467/20252987/s65_carina.ray.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 379, "name": "African Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2324, "name": "British History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3870, "name": "African Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3896, "name": "African History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3898, "name": "History of West Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_West_Africa?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4527, "name": "Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Africa?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4714, "name": "Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexuality?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5454, "name": "Interracial Families", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interracial_Families?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5671, "name": "West Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/West_Africa?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 9620, "name": "Ghana", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ghana?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 24294, "name": "Gender and Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Race?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 29719, "name": "Critical Mixed Race Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Mixed_Race_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 41327, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 280310, "name": "Ports", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ports?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 964785, "name": "Postcolonial and Anticolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_and_Anticolonial_Studies?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 1450104, "title": "Turkish Delight--German Fright: Unsettling Oppositions in Transnational Cinema", "created_at": "2012-03-01T08:38:01.702-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1450104/Turkish_Delight_German_Fright_Unsettling_Oppositions_in_Transnational_Cinema?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_1450104", "summary": "Current discourses about migrants and diaspora communities in Europe are often informed by a social worker's perspective and haunted by residual notions of supposedly pure and authentic cultures of origin.

One such group is the Eurasian \u201cIndo\u201d community that has its roots in the former Dutch East Indies, today\u2019s Indonesia. This article focuses on Tjalie Robinson, the intellectual leader of this community from the 1950s to the mid-1970s. The son of a Dutch father and a British-Javanese mother, Robinson became the leading voice of the diasporic Indo community in the Netherlands and later also in the United States. His engagement resulted in the foundation of the Indo magazine Tong Tong and the annual Pasar Malam Besar, what was to become the world\u2019s biggest Eurasian festival. Robinson played an essential role in the cultural awareness and self-pride of the eventually global Indo community through his elaboration of a hybrid and transnational identity concept. By placing his focus \u201ctussen twee werelden\u201d (in-between two worlds) and identifying \u201cmixties-schap\u201d (mestizaje) as the essential characteristic of Indo identity, Robinson anticipated debates on hybridity, transnationalism, and creolism that only much later would draw attention from scholars in the field of postcolonial studies. This article highlights Robinson\u2019s pioneering role in framing a deterritorialized hybrid alternative to nationalist essentialism in the postcolonial era.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

The Spanish translation and English commentary on Part 1 of F. LaMond Tulllis's Mormons in Mexico is a significant contribution to both Spanish and English readers. This text, published through Deseret Book, makes a valuable resource available to Spanish speakers. It also offers an impressive correction of documentary errors in Tullis's interpretation and historical data. A second significant contribution to the literature on the same subject is a series of four articles available in Spanish or English by Fernando R. G\u00f3mez P\u00e1ez (museum president). Read side by side, the translation of Tullis's book and this new selection of articles by the museum's president provide a worthwhile and balanced introduction to Mexican Mormon history. Readers will recognize that Mormon history in Mexico extends well beyond the colonies in Chihuahua and Sonora. The most interesting stories may very well come from central Mexico. Mexican Mormons now have a significant voice in the writing of their own Mormon histories.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37061515, "asset_id": 11322425, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 23864259, "first_name": "Thomas", "last_name": "Murphy", "domain_name": "edcc", "page_name": "ThomasMurphy", "display_name": "Thomas W Murphy", "profile_url": "https://edcc.academia.edu/ThomasMurphy?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/23864259/6957491/7846370/s65_thomas.murphy.jpg_oh_221215816ab2f6dbb3b332d396862f4c_oe_5521605e___gda___1428468681_8304ce3c9d498b851be8fbd40293e59f"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 388, "name": "Latin American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2395, "name": "Mexican Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mexican_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 20087, "name": "Mormonism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mormonism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 23543, "name": "Mormon History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mormon_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 43881, "name": "Mexico", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mexico?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 46524, "name": "Hispanic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hispanic_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 68505, "name": "Religion and State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_State?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 82138, "name": "Mormon studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mormon_studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 84798, "name": "20th Century Mexican History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/20th_Century_Mexican_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 619396, "name": "Anthropology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Religion?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 35805702, "title": "HISTORICAL TRAJECTORIES OF ETHNO-POLITICS AND CONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN SOUTHERN KADUNA NIGERIA", "created_at": "2018-01-31T07:24:30.279-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35805702/HISTORICAL_TRAJECTORIES_OF_ETHNO_POLITICS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT_IN_SOUTHERN_KADUNA_NIGERIA?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_35805702", "summary": "The indigene/settler question has been central to scholarly discourses on land ownership, ethnicity and identity in Nigeria. The legacies of the 1804 Jihad and the subsequent divide and rule colonial model of governance are extant in the perennial struggles for territorial control and dominance of political, economic, religious and socio-cultural spaces. In Northcentral Nigeria, the Southern Kaduna scenario in Zangon Kataf presents a context of the overlaps of ethnoreligious crises across macro and micro spaces in which the broad Hausa versus non Hausa sentiments influenced the political, economic and social exclusion claims of the Atyap within the context of indigene/settler debates. The study results from a two-year ethnographic fieldwork in the community (between 2012 and 2014) during, which observations, key-informant interviews and focus group discussions were combined with historical data; in unpacking the political economy of the 1992 market crises, and also exploring the politics of inclusion as an effective management strategy on which different state interventions on recent crises in Southern Kaduna could be modelled.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55682552, "asset_id": 35805702, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

Rodin\u2019s sculptures, in contrast, are hewn from monochrome materials\u2014marble, bronze, clay\u2014with no surface treatments. If the \u201cseriously sexual vibes\u201d advertised on the billboard come from the expected space of white female (and feminized) subjectivity, the \u201cartistic encounter\u201d on display is one of medium\u2014of painting\u2019s uncontested polychrome in contrast to the insistent monochrome of modern sculpture.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 76722757, "asset_id": 35687199, "asset_type":

I argue that these \nBlack-immigrant Muslim relations would be well-served to be examined through the discourse of Black-Asian intersection and comparative racial formation which has emanated mainly from \nethnic and Asian American studies fields. I then propose critical race studies scholar Eric Yamamoto\u2019s application of \u201crestorative justice\u201d\u2014a theory of justice which seeks to repair harm \nthrough a cooperative processes between the parties involved\u2014as a means to facilitate future discussions of racial and ethnic difference between Black and immigrant American Muslim \ncommunities, as well as a framework for how Muslim Americans can productively engage the state in ways that account for the trauma and violence their communities have experienced since \n9/11.

I use this notion of gender as a matter of space to compare Stone\u2019s discourse to that of feminist theorist and artist bell hooks, who describes the position of black women as a matter of space as well \u2013 a space from which black women develop an oppositional gaze and thus engage in the discourse, instead of being excluded from it. I compare Stone\u2019s strategy of reclaiming the insult and the notion of counter discourse that arises from that with hooks\u2019 notion of the oppositional gaze, as I examine how these new discourses can lead to forms of agency in a context of oppression. I take into consideration philosopher of feminist epistemology Sandra Harding\u2019s Standpoint Theory,  in order to understand Stone\u2019s and hooks\u2019 creation of a critical space that is developed through the deconstruction of oppressive binary systems, and in which knowledge and agency are generated by marginalized groups.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56976657, "asset_id":

that racism is accompanied by its denial is well established, this paper examines the widespread explicit advocacy of a stance of \u2018not racism\u2019. The rejection of racism by proponents of positions that hinder the cause of racial justice is the discursive next step in \u2018postracial\u2019 racism. I examine the various ways in which racism has been proposed to be an \u2018unhelpful\u2019 framework. I make the case that the dominant position within philosophy of race that racism is, first and foremost, a moral failing has unwittingly contributed to the emergence of \u2018not racism\u2019 as a dominant expression in race thinking today. Following an examination of several key moral philosophical analyses of racism, I illustrate my argument that \u2018not racism\u2019 is a form of racist violence with reference to several recent and contemporary cases against the backdrop of the rise of \u2018Global Trumpism\u2019.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57002655, "asset_id": 37051867, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 27119, "first_name": "Alana", "last_name": "Lentin", "domain_name": "westernsydney", "page_name": "AlanaLentin", "display_name": "Alana Lentin", "profile_url": "https://westernsydney.academia.edu/AlanaLentin?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/27119/8852/12259086/s65_alana.lentin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2432, "name": "Critical Race Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11639, "name": "Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 15312, "name": "Philosophy Of Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_Of_Race?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 16069, "name": "Critical Race Theory and Whiteness theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory_and_Whiteness_theory?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 19231, "name": "Race and ethnicity (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_ethnicity_Anthropology_?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 24294, "name": "Gender and Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Race?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 28507, "name": "History of Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 539318, "name": "Antiracism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Antiracism?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 33544358, "title": "Pluralism and Integration.pdf", "created_at": "2017-06-18T21:25:23.781-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33544358/Pluralism_and_Integration_pdf?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_33544358", "summary": "A theoretical examination of race and ethnic relations in terms of pluralism and integration based on equality versus those based on inequality.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53574332, "asset_id": 33544358, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4571630, "first_name": "Reginald", "last_name": "Daniel", "domain_name": "ucsb", "page_name": "ReginaldDaniel", "display_name": "Reginald Daniel", "profile_url": "https://ucsb.academia.edu/ReginaldDaniel?f_ri=5453", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 76841917, "title": "Abdias do Nascimento e o Museu de Arte Negra", "created_at": "2022-04-18T09:04:19.960-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/76841917/Abdias_do_Nascimento_e_o_Museu_de_Arte_Negra?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_76841917", "summary": "O artigo busca contribuir para o debate acerca dos museus, cole\u00e7\u00f5es e representa\u00e7\u00f5es tendo como foco o caso do Museu de Arte Negra (MAN), organizado pelo ativista, escritor e pintor Abdias do Nascimento.

It provides a key theoretical analysis regarding the nature of white patriarchal sovereignty in Aotearoa and the need of the state to appear virtuous, to continue the legacy that started with the Treaty of Waitangi to maintain this whenua (land) as a white possessive.

intro is available on my personal website via the link. The Shape of Sex is a pathbreaking history of nonbinary sex, focusing on ideas and individuals who allegedly combined or crossed sex or gender categories from 200\u20131400 C.E. Ranging widely across premodern European thought and culture, Leah DeVun reveals how and why efforts to define \u201cthe human\u201d so often hinged on ideas about nonbinary sex. \n\nThe Shape of Sex examines a host of thinkers\u2014theologians, cartographers, natural philosophers, lawyers, poets, surgeons, and alchemists\u2014who used ideas about nonbinary sex as conceptual tools to order their political, cultural, and natural worlds. DeVun reconstructs the cultural landscape navigated by individuals whose sex or gender did not fit the binary alongside debates about animality, sexuality, race, religion, and human nature. The Shape of Sex charts an embrace of nonbinary sex in early Christianity, its brutal erasure at the turn of the thirteenth century, and a new enthusiasm for nonbinary transformations at the dawn of the Renaissance. Along the way, DeVun explores beliefs that Adam and Jesus were nonbinary-sexed; images of \u201cmonstrous races\u201d in encyclopedias, maps, and illuminated manuscripts; justifications for violence against purportedly nonbinary outsiders such as Jews and Muslims; and the surgical \u201ccorrection\u201d of bodies that seemed to flout binary divisions. \n\nIn a moment when questions about sex, gender, and identity have become incredibly urgent, The Shape of Sex casts new light on a complex and often contradictory past. It shows how premodern thinkers created a system of sex and embodiment that both anticipates and challenges modern beliefs about what it means to be male, female\u2014and human.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67351777, "asset_id": 48955825, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3805546, "first_name": "Leah", "last_name": "DeVun", "domain_name": "rutgers", "page_name": "LeahDeVun", "display_name": "Leah DeVun", "profile_url": "https://rutgers.academia.edu/LeahDeVun?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3805546/1382565/41589759/s65_leah.devun.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 109, "name": "Christianity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christianity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 699, "name": "Queer Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 983, "name": "Jewish Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jewish_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1078, "name": "Intersexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersexuality?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1302, "name": "Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1446, "name": "Medieval History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2059, "name": "History of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Religion?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2272, "name": "Gender History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2273, "name": "History of Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Medicine?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2624, "name": "Transgender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transgender_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2853, "name": "Medieval Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3723, "name": "History of Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Science?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4918, "name": "Gay And Lesbian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gay_And_Lesbian_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5265, "name": "Alchemy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alchemy?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 22386, "name": "Medieval Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_Art?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 49663, "name": "Women and Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_Gender_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1778279, "name": "Medieval Sexuality and Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_Sexuality_and_Gender?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 3800618, "title": "All the Gays are White and all the Blacks are Straight: Black Gay Men, Identity, and Community", "created_at": "2013-06-26T22:37:21.600-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3800618/All_the_Gays_are_White_and_all_the_Blacks_are_Straight_Black_Gay_Men_Identity_and_Community?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_3800618", "summary": "The research on which this study reports was informed by the following questions: Do Black gay men identify more closely with a racial identity or with a sexual identity?

Essentially, how do Black gay men negotiate stigmatized identities?

The research was conducted by Centre for Social Policy Studies of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and by S.K.H. Lady MacLehose Centre. Our aim was to explore the difficulties faced by the Pakistanis and delineate the macro forces shaping their lives. Through this, we see that ethnicity is one of the key dimensions of social stratification and inequality in contemporary Hong Kong society. We also hope that this research can well serve as a case to illustrate the relationship between ethnicity and social exclusion. \n\nThis research consists of a questionnaire survey and focus group interviews. The questionnaire survey was conducted between February and May of 2002. We have completed 200 questionnaires through snowball sampling. The questionnaire covered five broad areas: social activities and friendship, utilization of community resources, work and employment, children's education and sense of belonging to Hong Kong. The part on focus group interviews aims to further explore the complex dynamic of life experiences that could not be described by quantitative data in the survey, as well as to develop recommendations for improving social policy and social services. Two focus groups, with a total of ten male and female participants were conducted at the end of October 2002.\n\nOn social activities, we found that the major activities of the respondents are staying at home, meeting friends and going to worship. Participation in other social activities such as going to see arts and cultural programmes, engaging in sports activities, going to the library, and joining activities in a community centre, is limited. In terms of establishing friendships, most of the respondents interact only with their own people. They reflect that it is difficult to make Hong Kong friends. Cultural and language differences are some of the major barriers to making friends with Hong Kong people and to participating in social activities. \n\nOn housing, a majority of the respondents live in private rental housing. Some of them do not know how to apply for public rental housing and some believe that they are not eligible to apply, even though they are in need. Most of the respondents have had problems in looking for private housing, and identify expensive rent or housing prices as the main one. Some of them say that they have a problem communicating with agents in Cantonese and believe that they are rejected by landlords simply because they are Pakistanis. This shows that some Pakistanis have difficulties gaining access to housing resources, both in the public and private sector. \n\nOn social security resources, in fact, few respondents are receiving Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA). Most of them clearly state that they do not want to depend on the government or do not need to do so. \nAlmost all of the respondents were not engaged in part-time studies or in an employees retraining course. They are discouraged for various reasons, such as high course fees, the fact that the courses are taught in Cantonese, or because they do not know of any educational or social institutes nearby.\n\nOn access to social services and community resources, very few respondents have approached social workers for help on everyday needs; instead they rely almost solely on their family, relatives and friends. Some respondents do not even know of any nearby social service centres and have never brought their children there. Their poor access to various community resources is not only due to language problems, but also because many government departments, educational institutes and social service centres do not target non-Chinese.\n\nOn work and employment, many respondents encounter great difficulties. Twenty-three point nine per cent of the respondents are unemployed. About half of the respondents have been unemployed at some point in the past two years. Most of the employed respondents are engaged in elementary occupations where the working hours are generally very long. The median number of working hours is 60 per week. However, their monthly income is comparatively low. \n\nOn looking for jobs, most respondents identify not knowing Cantonese and low educational qualifications as the major difficulties. It is alarming to learn that about one-third of the respondents claimed that they are rejected because they are Pakistanis. Some employers systematically eliminate them from selection and treat them unfairly at work. In the workplace, the respondents face various difficulties including problems communicating with supervisors and colleagues, bullying by supervisors and colleagues, conflicts due to cultural and/or religious practices, and diverse forms of racial discrimination.\n\nOn children\u2019s education, the respondents encounter various difficulties including unreasonably long waiting times in finding school places, expensive school fees, conflicts due to cultural and/or religious practices, and being rejected because they are Pakistanis. The focus group participants also highlighted problems for Muslims involving food in school canteens and the dress codes of female Pakistani students.\n\nThough they face numerous difficulties in Hong Kong, about half of the respondents like Hong Kong very much and treat the place as their home. However, this does not mean that they enjoy being with Hong Kong people. Some focus group participants also held ambivalent attitudes toward Hong Kong and Hong Kong people.\n\nBased on the problems reflected in the questionnaire survey and the opinions expressed in the focus group interviews, we recommend policy changes in the following areas: employment, housing, and educational services, as well as a review of the policy on granting Hong Kong SAR passports to non-Chinese residents. To improve the general situation, we recommend anti-racial discrimination legislation to protect the right of ethnic minorities, and to promote a policy of multiculturalism in which cultural differences and ethnic diversity are respected. The aim is to build Hong Kong into a just and caring society.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51543093, "asset_id": 31107775, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 41717295, "first_name": "Hok Bun", "last_name": "Ku", "domain_name": "cpce-polyu", "page_name": "HokKu", "display_name": "Hok Bun  Ku", "profile_url": "https://cpce-polyu.academia.edu/HokKu?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/41717295/11331335/12640951/s65_hok.ku.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25021, "name": "Hong Kong", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hong_Kong?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 19873554, "title": "Hyphenated Cultures: Ethnicity and Nation in Trinidad.

We show that postgenomic research on health disparities in Latin America reintroduces old colonial views about the relations between race, environment, and social status. This especially refers to the idea \u2013 common in colonial humoralism and epigenetics \u2013 that different types of bodies are in balance and closely linked with particular local environments and lifestyles. These social differences become embodied as physiological and health differences. By comparing Spanish chronicles of the New World with recent epidemiological narratives on Mexican populations in social epigenetics (especially on obesity), we identify four characteristics that both share in distinguishing races, such as indigenous or mestizos from Spaniards or non-Mexicans: (i) Race is not intrinsic to bodies but emerges as a particular homeostatic body-environment relation; (ii) the stability of one's race is warranted through the stability of one's local environment and lifestyle, especially nutrition; (iii) every race faces specific life challenges in a local environment to maintain its health; and (iv) every race shows a unique social status that is closely linked to its biological status (e.g., disease susceptibility). Based on these similarities, we argue that currently in Latin America the field of epigenetics appears on the scene with a worrisome colonial shadow. It reintroduces long forgotten exclusionary and stereotypic perspectives on indigenous and mestizos, and biologizes as well as racializes social-cultural differences among human groups.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60587219, "asset_id": 38588393, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 690589, "first_name": "Abigail", "last_name": "Nieves Delgado", "domain_name": "uu", "page_name": "AbigailNievesDelgado", "display_name": "Abigail Nieves Delgado", "profile_url": "https://uu.academia.edu/AbigailNievesDelgado?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/690589/2686686/17384273/s65_abigail.nieves_delgado.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 388, "name": "Latin American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14406, "name": "Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Health?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22404, "name": "Epigenetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Epigenetics?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 25807648, "title": "Modelos de santidad: devocionarios y hagiograf\u00edas a San Benito de Palermo en Nueva Espa\u00f1a", "created_at": "2016-06-02T09:29:17.021-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/25807648/Modelos_de_santidad_devocionarios_y_hagiograf%C3%ADas_a_San_Benito_de_Palermo_en_Nueva_Espa%C3%B1a?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_25807648", "summary": "The focus of this article is the hagiographies and novenas to San Benito de Palermo that circulated in the territories of New Spain, most of which were produced locally in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The Carribean was one of the countries where the British colonists ruled with all might and sway, badly affecting the lives of its colonized people. Of these colonized people, it was the female colonized who suffered even more due to the additional patriarchal structure imposed on them as well. In this regard, Jean Rhys's novel Wide Sargasso Sea (WSS) presents a faithful and comprehensive critique. For this purpose, first of all, the related literature was reviewed on the concept of double colonization with reference to WSS in light of the relevant views. Next, for the purpose of analysis, the study was delimited to the plight of the main character Antoinette and her mother Annette in light of the various events and discourses from WSS as to how double colonization affected the lives of the aforementioned female characters. On the basis of the analysis, it was found out that double colonization affected Antoinette and Annette by a number of its main aspects and factors, such as, economic exploitation, marriages, otherness, cultural hybridity, and patriarchy, by bringing about their alienation not only from the colonial and patriarchal culture around but also from their own self and life, thus suffering from

The reticence to embrace CRT is\nlargely due to the overwhelming presence ofWhiteness, despite Sleeter\u2019s (2001) demand for diversification.\nThis theoretically interpretative article employs CRT\u2019s methodology of counterstorytelling to\ninterrogate how Whiteness manifests itself in emotional ways, like fetishism and sentimentalization,\nand how such emotions are the root of resistance toward CRT in teacher education. Drawing from\nBlack feminism and Critical Whiteness Studies, we utilize emotionally-based theories to illustrate the\nimportance of CRT in teacher education, to identify barriers to CRT, and to recommend how teacher\neducation can more genuinely reinvest in antiracism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42060995, "asset_id": 21557671, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

changing. The Oxford Handbook of Contemporary Buddhism offers a comprehensive collection of work by leading scholars in the field that tracks these changes up to the present day. Taken together, the book provides a blueprint to understanding Buddhism's past and uses it to explore the ways in which Buddhism has transformed in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.\n\nThe volume contains 41 essays, divided into two sections. The essays in the first section examine the historical development of Buddhist traditions throughout the world. These chapters cover familiar settings like India, Japan, and Tibet as well as the less well-known countries of Vietnam, Bhutan, and the regions of Latin America, Africa, and Oceania. Focusing on changes within countries and transnationally, this section also contains chapters that focus explicitly on globalization, such as Buddhist international organizations and diasporic communities. The second section tracks the relationship between Buddhist traditions and particular themes. These chapters review Buddhist interactions with contemporary topics such as violence and peacebuilding, and ecology, as well as Buddhist influences in areas such as medicine and science.\n\nOffering coverage that is both expansive and detailed, The Oxford Handbook of Contemporary Buddhism delves into some of the most debated and contested areas within Buddhist Studies today.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49884364, "asset_id": 29438074, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4662095, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Jerryson", "domain_name": "youngstown", "page_name": "MichaelJerryson", "display_name": "Michael Jerryson", "profile_url": "https://youngstown.academia.edu/MichaelJerryson?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4662095/1957608/2787274/s65_michael.jerryson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 113, "name": "Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 379, "name": "African Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 383, "name": "European Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/European_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 387, "name": "Japanese Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 388, "name": "Latin American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 724, "name": "Economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economics?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1697, "name": "Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Violence?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1987, "name": "Ethnomusicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnomusicology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2905, "name": "Tibetan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tibetan_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2906, "name": "Buddhist Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3902, "name": "Korean Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Korean_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6034, "name": "Mongolian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mongolian_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6815, "name": "Laos (Lao PDR)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Laos_Lao_PDR_?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 9846, "name": "Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 9850, "name": "Sri Lanka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lanka?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 12108, "name": "China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 16655, "name": "Vietnam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnam?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 17562, "name": "Death and Burial (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Death_and_Burial_Archaeology_?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 26474, "name": "Tantra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tantra?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 106646, "name": "Bhutan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bhutan?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 166999, "name": "Oceania", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oceania?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 35642682, "title": "Comedy Syllabus (Spring 2017)", "created_at": "2018-01-11T08:28:07.657-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35642682/Comedy_Syllabus_Spring_2017_?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_35642682", "summary": "What makes some jokes so funny?

Kimberly Crenshaw developed the notion of intersectionality in 1989 in her paper \u201cDe-marginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Anti-discrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics\u201d. On that occasion, her goal was to challenge the limitations of anti-discrimination laws that looked at gender and race as separated and mutually exclusive categories. Over the past thirty years, intersectionality has become an essential analytical tool to explore how multiple structures of oppression shape individual vulnerability. In this interview, Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw offers not only a crash course in intersectionality for our readers, but tells us why intersectionality is vital to transform the current political situation. In a majestic example of theoretical sophistication and simplicity, Crenshaw uses the notion of intersectional failure to explain the election of Donald Trump. It is not simply the resentment of a white working class that feels \u201cleft behind\u201d which explains the electoral triumph of the far right, she argues. It is working class resentment rooted in male entitlement and white supremacy, which determines this victory. In this sense, the triumph of the far-right in countries such the United States or Italy that have an un-resolved history of white supremacy and fascism, can be seen as the result of a number of intersectional failures \u2013 when class consciousness doesn\u2019t contest the logics of racism, when anti-racism doesn\u2019t contest the logics of patriarchy, when feminism doesn\u2019t contest the logic of racism, they end up reinforcing them all.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63757344, "asset_id": 43450841, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3486982, "first_name": "Francesca", "last_name": "Coin", "domain_name": "lancaster", "page_name": "FrancescaCoin", "display_name": "Francesca Coin", "profile_url": "https://lancaster.academia.edu/FrancescaCoin?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3486982/3180127/3743244/s65_francesca.coin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2432, "name": "Critical Race Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 7894, "name": "Intersectionality Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality_Theory?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 16069, "name": "Critical Race Theory and Whiteness theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory_and_Whiteness_theory?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 26743, "name": "Intersectionality and Social Inequality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality_and_Social_Inequality?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 34327, "name": "Intersectionality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 66677, "name": "Italian fascism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Italian_fascism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1250479, "name": "Donald Trump", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Donald_Trump?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 34360790, "title": "The Traditional Research Paper is Best", "created_at": "2017-08-26T07:14:37.771-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34360790/The_Traditional_Research_Paper_is_Best?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_34360790", "summary": "Teaching the research paper has been considered a \u201cpresent controversy\u201d for over fifty years (Saalbach, 1963). Some scholars believe that it prepares students for \u201cgeneralized academic writing\u201d (Reiff and Bawarshi, 2011; Sutton, 1997; Schwegeler and Shamoon, 1982). However, others have referred to the research paper as a \u201cfossilized,\u201d \u201cpseudo-academic,\u201d \u201cmutt genre\u201d (Nowacek, 2011; Wardle, 2007; Carroll, 1999; Larsen, 1982). This chapter argues that radical openness and information overload--two major features of new media composing environments--compromise the relevance of the traditional research paper. First, the research paper has been praised and blamed for its (in)ability to help students learn the importance of writing from sources (Brent 2013, Rooney 2000). However, the parameters of most research assignments are incapable of matching the scale of data available at any given time. For instance, typical constraints like \u201cuse 5-7 sources\u201d for a first-year college writing course seems ridiculous when it takes seconds to retrieve thousands, if not millions, of possible sources. Next, open-access publishing and collaborative authorship have transformed the way that research is conducted and recognized across disciplines. Although teaching students how to crowdsource research makes the most sense in a data deluge, the research paper privileges single authorship. Moreover, the problems of authorship and source attribution implicate the research paper in certain kinds of fraud. For instance, plagiarism and term paper mills are a \u201cbuilt-in\u201d problem of research papers (Howell, 1977).  In sum, this chapter focuses on what the term \"research\" means in a context of too much information.  It concludes by offering a brief discussion of literature relevant to this topic.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54251257, "asset_id": 34360790, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 402794, "first_name": "Alexandria", "last_name": "Lockett", "domain_name": "spelman", "page_name": "AlexandriaLockett", "display_name": "Alexandria Lockett", "profile_url": "https://spelman.academia.edu/AlexandriaLockett?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/402794/126202/27789459/s65_alexandria.lockett.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 37, "name": "Information Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Systems?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1210, "name": "Informatics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Informatics?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2065, "name": "Research Methodology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Research_Methodology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3557, "name": "History of Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Technology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 7480, "name": "Surveillance Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Surveillance_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 12857, "name": "Technology and Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Technology_and_Society?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14413, "name": "Womanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womanism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 17282, "name": "English Grammar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Grammar?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 25064, "name": "Black Feminist Theory/Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Feminist_Theory_Thought?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 50569, "name": "Language Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 126300, "name": "Big Data", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Big_Data?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 81814366, "title": "Empire, diplomacy, and the racial imagination: Spain at the Cairo Congress of Arab Music (1932)", "created_at": "2022-06-19T04:31:01.273-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/81814366/Empire_diplomacy_and_the_racial_imagination_Spain_at_the_Cairo_Congress_of_Arab_Music_1932_?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_81814366", "summary": "This article uses Spain's participation at the Cairo Congress of Arab Music (1932) as the basis to raise questions pertaining to the place of Arab music in the racial imagination of Europeans. It argues that Spain's unique response to the challenges arising from the study of Arab music in a context of colonial rivalry reveals still uncharted tensions and fractures running through musicology and Orientalist discourse at the time. My line of inquiry sheds light on the origins and characteristics of the forms of self-reflexivity evident in the musicological work produced by Spain and other European countries. In what ways did the shifting tectonics of North African politics impact or even impair the capacity of European musicological discourse to inscribe Arab music in the global imagination in ways supportive of Europe's identity projects? To what extent was the discourse on Arab music emerging in the context of colonial rivalry suitable for Spain to rewrite the memories of its past of anti-Muslim violence? What could Spain's unique position as both an insider and an outsider relative to notions of Europe reveal about western attitudes towards Arab music in a context of colonial rivalry? The answers to these questions lie not only with the peculiar ways in which Spain addressed its identity crises, but also with the extent to which the Cairo Congress exposed the inadequacy of reigning paradigms in musicology, anthropology and the social sciences, and underscored their inability to keep up with the changing face of North African societies.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 100437731, "asset_id": 81814366, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 516010, "first_name": "Samuel", "last_name": "Llano", "domain_name": "manchester", "page_name": "SamuelLlano", "display_name": "Samuel Llano", "profile_url": "https://manchester.academia.edu/SamuelLlano?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/516010/180562/14887246/s65_samuel.llano.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 671, "name": "Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1174, "name": "Spanish Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spanish_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1987, "name": "Ethnomusicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnomusicology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 11483, "name": "Cultural Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Memory?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 12809, "name": "Middle Eastern Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_Eastern_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 13684, "name": "Morocco", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Morocco?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 18825, "name": "Modern Egypt", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Egypt?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 24365, "name": "History of Musicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Musicology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 31227, "name": "Cultural Diplomacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Diplomacy?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 36635, "name": "Contemporary History of Spain", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_History_of_Spain?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 46524, "name": "Hispanic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hispanic_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 51334, "name": "Orientalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Orientalism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 138303, "name": "Memory and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_and_Identity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 141527, "name": "Moroccan Colonial History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Moroccan_Colonial_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 175902, "name": "Arabic music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arabic_music?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 749612, "name": "Comparative Musicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Musicology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 785908, "name": "Post-Orientalism.

On the surface, games do not appear ideological, nor are they categorized as national products. Instead, they seem to reflect the open and uncontaminated reputation of information technology.\n\nVideo games are undeniably imperial products. Their very existence has been conditioned upon the spread of militarized technology, the exploitation of already-existing labor and racial hierarchies in their manufacture, and the utopian promises of digital technology. Like literature and film before it, video games have become the main artistic expression of empire today: the open world empire, formed through the routes of information technology and the violences of drone combat, unending war, and overseas massacres that occur with little scandal or protest.\n\nThough often presented as purely technological feats, video games are also artistic projects, and as such, they allow us an understanding of how war and imperial violence proceed under signs of openness, transparency, and digital utopia. But the video game, as Christopher B. Patterson argues, is also an inherently Asian commodity: its hardware is assembled in Asia; its most talented e-sports players are of Asian origin; Nintendo, Sony, and Sega have defined and dominated the genre. Games draw on established discourses of Asia to provide an \u201cAsiatic\u201d space, a playful sphere of racial otherness that straddles notions of the queer, the exotic, the bizarre, and the erotic. Thinking through games like Overwatch, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Shenmue II, and Alien: Isolation, Patterson reads against empire by playing games erotically, as players do\u2014seeing games as Asiatic playthings that afford new passions, pleasures, desires, and attachments.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64517321, "asset_id": 40746601, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 467136, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Patterson", "domain_name": "ubc", "page_name": "ChristopherPatterson", "display_name": "Christopher B Patterson", "profile_url": "https://ubc.academia.edu/ChristopherPatterson?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/467136/155247/34499540/s65_christopher.patterson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 390, "name": "American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 883, "name": "Game studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Game_studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 928, "name": "Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3114, "name": "Queer Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Theory?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3764, "name": "Asian American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_American_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5199, "name": "Video Games", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Video_Games?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 8673, "name": "Digital Media & Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Media_and_Learning?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 73270084, "title": "Zafer Sara\u00e7-\u0130nsan Irklar\u0131n\u0131n E\u015fitsizli\u011fi- www.kitapyurdu.com YT 02.03.2022", "created_at": "2022-03-07T12:58:04.532-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/73270084/Zafer_Sara%C3%A7_%C4%B0nsan_Irklar%C4%B1n%C4%B1n_E%C5%9Fitsizli%C4%9Fi_www_kitapyurdu_com_YT_02_03_2022?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_73270084", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81855294, "asset_id": 73270084, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31781043, "first_name": "Zafer", "last_name": "Sara\u00e7", "domain_name": "firat", "page_name": "ZaferSara\u00e7", "display_name": "Zafer  Sara\u00e7", "profile_url": "https://firat.academia.edu/ZaferSara%C3%A7?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31781043/11099872/14921898/s65_zafer.sara_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11639, "name": "Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48523, "name": "Book Reviews", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Book_Reviews?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 79501, "name": "Etnologia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Etnologia?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 92517, "name": "Antropolog\u00eda", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Antropolog%C3%ADa?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1489895, "name": "Arthur de Gobineau", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arthur_de_Gobineau?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 41871529, "title": "Classicisms in the Black Atlantic", "created_at": "2020-02-05T12:52:04.173-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41871529/Classicisms_in_the_Black_Atlantic?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_41871529", "summary": "The historical and cultural space of the Black Atlantic\u2014a diasporic world of forced and voluntary migrations\u2014has long provided fertile ground for the construction and reconstruction of new forms of classicism.

When I meet Pacific Islanders who cheerfully refer to themselves and others as \u2018mixed-bloods\u2019 or \u2018halfies\u2019, does this mean that the legacies of colonialism have vanished? That the battles over legitimacy and belonging are over, and these terms, often ascribed to people in the past by others in order to denigrate can now be embraced? What history and what purposes do such identity assertions have? In this article I am examining assertions of identity of German-Pacific Islanders of multiple heritage during and after the end of the German colonial empire in the Pacific in order to see how mixed heritage was expressed in different political situations. My case studies focus on families of Samoan and German descent. This is not to say that these families and individuals did and do not have more diverse heritage, including Tongan, Swedish, Japanese, Filipino, Danish, Fijian or French. I am limiting this chapter, however, to an historical exploration how two specific building blocks of identity were used, German and Samoan.\n\nIn particular I build on and explore L.  Wildenthal's analysis of gendered responses to mixedness further, analysing the differences of male and female responses and identity desires for their children.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51975927, "asset_id": 31651449, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 23160563, "first_name": "Christine", "last_name": "Winter", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "ChristineWinter", "display_name": "Christine Winter", "profile_url": "https://flinders.academia.edu/ChristineWinter?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/23160563/6287756/80449103/s65_christine.winter.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1729, "name": "German History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2365, "name": "Pacific Island Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pacific_Island_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 20606, "name": "Papua New Guinea", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Papua_New_Guinea?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 29719, "name": "Critical Mixed Race Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Mixed_Race_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 43023, "name": "Nazi Germany", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nazi_Germany?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 688684, "name": "Samoan Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Samoan_Culture?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 33339035, "title": "\" My Crown Too Heavy Like the Queen Nefertiti \" : A Black Feminist Analysis of", "created_at": "2017-06-05T13:40:49.758-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33339035/_My_Crown_Too_Heavy_Like_the_Queen_Nefertiti_A_Black_Feminist_Analysis_of?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_33339035", "summary": "With the \u201ccontrolling images\u201d of the Jezebel, the Mammy, and the Sapphire constantly reiterated in movies, television shows, and popular culture, serving the interests of what bell hooks has identified as white supremacist, capitalist patriarchy, a consumer has to wonder if there is any way for Black women performers to thrive and empower other Black women while working within these constricting institutions.

The purpose is to take the expansions of Black feminism that Collins, Davis, hooks, and several other Black feminist intellectuals, have articulated in order to reflect the broad ways in which Black feminism plays out in the popular music industry and to argue against the grain of critiques of popular culture to demonstrate how, despite its limitations, this realm of cultural representation and performance can be emancipatory for black women.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53398891, "asset_id": 33339035, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9268752, "first_name": "Dr. Brianne", "last_name": "Painia", "domain_name": "lsu", "page_name": "BriPainiaPhD", "display_name": "Dr. Brianne A Painia", "profile_url": "https://lsu.academia.edu/BriPainiaPhD?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9268752/3234293/24956503/s65_dr._brianne.painia.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1631, "name": "Popular Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Music?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2858, "name": "Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Culture?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 10453, "name": "Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14412, "name": "Black feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_feminism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 24294, "name": "Gender and Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Race?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 25064, "name": "Black Feminist Theory/Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Feminist_Theory_Thought?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 27342520, "title": "Race-Making and Colonial Violence in the U.S. Empire: The Philippine-American War as Race War", "created_at": "2016-07-28T10:42:06.976-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27342520/Race_Making_and_Colonial_Violence_in_the_U_S_Empire_The_Philippine_American_War_as_Race_War?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_27342520", "summary": "This essay discusses racialization and colonial warfare as entangled processes during the Philippine-American War.

The domiciled community (of Anglo-Indians and Domiciled Europeans, treated as a single socio-economic class by Britons) were relied upon as loyal buttressing agents of British rule who could be deployed to help run the Raj\u2019s strategically sensitive transport and communication infrastructure, and who were made as a term of their service to serve in auxiliary military forces which could help to ensure the internal security of the Raj and respond to strikes, civil disobedience or crises arising from international conflict.\n\nThe thesis reveals how calls for Indianisation of state and railway employment by Indian nationalists in the assemblies inaugurated by the 1919 Government of India Act threatened, through opening up their reserved intermediary positions to competitive entry and examination by Indians, to undermine the economic base of domiciled employment. Anglo-Indian leaders responded with varying strategies. Foremost was the definition of Anglo-Indians as an Indian minority community which demanded political representation through successive phases of constitutional change and statutory safeguards for their existing employment. This study explores various strategies including: deployment of multiple identities; widespread racial passing by individuals and families; agricultural colonisation schemes; and calls for individual, familial or collective migration.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60440391, "asset_id": 40213220, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8139224, "first_name": "Uther", "last_name": "Charlton-Stevens", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "UtherCharltonStevens", "display_name": "Uther E Charlton-Stevens", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/UtherCharltonStevens?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8139224/2813111/94272285/s65_uther.charlton-stevens.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6337, "name": "Oral history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oral_history?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 7361, "name": "Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 9756, "name": "Racial Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_Identity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 10006, "name": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_and_Racial_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 29170, "name": "Burma", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Burma?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 29719, "name": "Critical Mixed Race Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Mixed_Race_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 30786, "name": "Constitutional Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Constitutional_Politics?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 43930, "name": "Constitutional History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Constitutional_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 54319, "name": "Minorities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minorities?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 71738, "name": "constitution of India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/constitution_of_India?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 80848, "name": "Mixed Race Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mixed_Race_Identity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 504056, "name": "Anglo Indians", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anglo_Indians?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 1463102, "title": "Ethnicity and the Writing of Medieval Scottish History", "created_at": "2012-03-05T06:09:46.675-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1463102/Ethnicity_and_the_Writing_of_Medieval_Scottish_History?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_1463102", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 11484346, "asset_id": 1463102, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1268999, "first_name": "Matthew", "last_name": "Hammond", "domain_name": "kcl", "page_name": "MHammond", "display_name": "Matthew  Hammond", "profile_url": "https://kcl.academia.edu/MHammond?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1268999/465948/62619920/s65_matthew.hammond.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3029, "name": "Medieval Historiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_Historiography?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3524, "name": "Historiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historiography?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34680, "name": "Medieval Scotland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_Scotland?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 183401, "name": "Celtic Scotland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Celtic_Scotland?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 4316760, "title": "\u201cSlavery in the Spanish Philippines\u201d, by W.H.

Papers:  Representation of race, ethnicity and culture in digital games \r\n\r\nAsia Pacific Media Educator (Volume 26:1, June 2016) will explore the issues of race, cultural diversity, cross-cultural representations and inter-cultural dynamics in digital games.  This thematic issue will address three topic areas:\r\n1) Representation in digital games:\r\nGames like the Global Conflict series have been used to simulate the media\u2019s role in fostering understanding and awareness of racial and ethnic conflicts.  One such example is Global Palestine in which Israeli students play as Palestinians, and Palestinian students play as Israelis.  What is the future of such games that deliberate on issues of political conflicts driven by race and ethnicity? Can games be used to foster cross-cultural understanding and enhance tolerance/acceptance of diversity in race and religion?  How do digital games incite racial hatred?  Besides entertainment, what other functions do games play in contemporary multicultural societies? \r\n\r\n2) Discourse on race and culture in teaching journalism:\r\nHow can media academics recognise and respond to the discourse about race, religion, ethnicity and politics in digital games? What are the educational trends in teaching about multiculturalism in games? How are the issues of cultural diversity in digital games discussed in media studies and journalism courses?  What are the innovative practices in teaching cultural diversity with digital games?\r\n\r\n3) Development of multicultural digital games\r\nWhile the majority of high-profile titles are developed and distributed from the US and Japan,  the drive to reduce production costs has meant that development is frequently outsourced to countries  such as Indonesia, India, Vietnam, Poland, the Czech Republic and Russia. However, while game development is increasingly becoming a global enterprise, questions remain over the extent to which this diversity of production is reflected in the game content. \r\n\r\nCommentaries and Q&As\r\nThis thematic issue also welcomes commentaries and book reviews, which take the form of Q&As with the book authors.  Book reviewers should inform the guest editors the books to be reviewed and whether the book authors are contactable for a Q&A.   \r\n \r\nDeadlines are as follows:\r\nAbstract for consideration:  30 September 2015\r\nPaper for double blind peer review: 30 November 2015\r\nPeer review period: November \u2013 December 2015\r\nSubmission of final paper:  15 January 2016\r\n\r\nThe word lengths for full papers are:\r\n\u2022\tCommentaries (3000 \u2013 3500 words)\r\n\u2022\tResearch papers (6000 words max including references)\r\n\u2022\tBook reviews (Q&A with book author) (1500 words max)\r\n\r\nThis issue will be guest edited by Dr Mark Finn (Swinburne University of Technology) and Dr Wajeehah Aayeshah (Charles Sturt University).  \r\nPlease email abstracts and paper to wajeehah@gmail.com, and copy to the Editor-in-Chief, Dr Eric Loo (University of Wollongong) at:  eloo@uow.edu.au\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38720546, "asset_id": 14907140, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 198775, "first_name": "Wajeehah", "last_name": "Aayeshah", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "WajeehahAayeshah", "display_name": "Wajeehah Aayeshah", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/WajeehahAayeshah?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/198775/91192/878593/s65_wajeehah.aayeshah.jpg"}, {"id": 3417323, "first_name": "Eric", "last_name": "Loo", "domain_name": "uow", "page_name": "EricLoo", "display_name": "Eric Loo", "profile_url": "https://uow.academia.edu/EricLoo?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3417323/1159833/10815402/s65_eric.loo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 757, "name": "Game Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Game_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 883, "name": "Game studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Game_studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 928, "name": "Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 934, "name": "Media and Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 994, "name": "Journalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Journalism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1003, "name": "Educational Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Technology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3429, "name": "Educational Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Research?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5199, "name": "Video Games", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Video_Games?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6865, "name": "Digital Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Culture?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 9246, "name": "Social Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 31221, "name": "InterCultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/InterCultural_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 44238, "name": "Educational Games", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Games?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 54340, "name": "Journalism Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Journalism_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 55133, "name": "Educational Gaming", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Gaming?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 265637, "name": "Journalism and Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Journalism_and_Media_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 275897, "name": "EDUCATIONAL GAMES, AUGMENTED REALITY, SERIOUS GAMES", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/EDUCATIONAL_GAMES_AUGMENTED_REALITY_SERIOUS_GAMES?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 693676, "name": "Department of Media Studies and Journalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Department_of_Media_Studies_and_Journalism?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 17248054, "title": "Racial Primes and Black Misandry on Historically White Campuses: Toward Critical Race Accountability in Educational Administration", "created_at": "2015-10-24T07:39:23.617-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/17248054/Racial_Primes_and_Black_Misandry_on_Historically_White_Campuses_Toward_Critical_Race_Accountability_in_Educational_Administration?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_17248054", "summary": "Racial primes are an outgrowth and inculcation of a well-structured, highly developed, racially conservative, \u201crace-neutral\u201d or \u201ccolor-blind\u201d racial socialization process in which children learn race-specific stereotypes about African Americans and other race/ethnic groups.

Under what conditions do states change their policies toward minorities? Why do the state elites reconsider the state- minority relations and change government policies toward nationhood? Adopting a comparative-historical analysis, the book unpacks these  research questions and builds a theoretical framework by looking at three paradigmatic policy changes: Ottomanism in the mid-19th century, Turkish nationalism in the early 1920s, and multiculturalism in Turkey in the early 2000s. While the book reveals the role of international context, intrastate elite competition, and non-state actors in such policy changes, it argues that state elites adopt either exclusionary or inclusionary policies based on the idea of \u201csurvival of the state.\u201d", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58226331, "asset_id": 38189204, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 120451, "first_name": "Serhun", "last_name": "Al", "domain_name": "iue", "page_name": "SerhunAl", "display_name": "Serhun  Al", "profile_url": "https://iue.academia.edu/SerhunAl?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/120451/32344/104962071/s65_serhun.al.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 796, "name": "Comparative Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Politics?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1187, "name": "Ottoman History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ottoman_History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2015, "name": "Middle East Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_East_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5548, "name": "Kurdish Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kurdish_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6610, "name": "Turkish Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Turkish_Nationalism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 8700, "name": "Turkish and Middle East Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Turkish_and_Middle_East_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 11208, "name": "Ottoman Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ottoman_Empire?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 15899, "name": "Kurdish Question in Turkey", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kurdish_Question_in_Turkey?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 18623, "name": "Middle East Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_East_Politics?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 19675, "name": "Modern Turkey", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Turkey?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 30160, "name": "Minority Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_Rights?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 33180, "name": "Political Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 116356, "name": "Milliyet\u00e7ilik", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Milliyet%C3%A7ilik?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 328831, "name": "T\u00fcrk Siyasi Tarihi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Turk_Siyasi_Tarihi?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 16515003, "title": "Pengaruh Etnik Terhadap Kualiti Pengajaran Guru di Bilik Darjah: Satu Kajian Perbandingan Antara Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan dan Sekolah Rendah Jenis Kebangsaan Tamil", "created_at": "2015-10-06T09:35:34.090-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/16515003/Pengaruh_Etnik_Terhadap_Kualiti_Pengajaran_Guru_di_Bilik_Darjah_Satu_Kajian_Perbandingan_Antara_Sekolah_Rendah_Kebangsaan_dan_Sekolah_Rendah_Jenis_Kebangsaan_Tamil?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_16515003", "summary": "The study aimed to make a comparison on the quality of teaching and learning in the classroom in national primary school and Tamil national type primary school.

"dom_id": "work_10022165", "summary": "The Italian nineteenth-century ethnographic fascination with regional folklore was a phenomenon linked, in part, to the country's unification. As Italians sought to define their new kingdom, popular and scholarly studies emerged on the peninsula's indigenous regional traditions. Although valuable for cultural preservation, such investigations reinforced stereotypes regarding the \u2018backwards\u2019 or \u2018barbaric\u2019 nature of Italy's poorer areas, many of them in the Meridione. This article investigates late-nineteenth-century constructions of \u2018primitive\u2019 social fictions about Sicily\u00a0\u2013\u00a0that positioned the region as the \u2018other\u2019 Africa\u00a0\u2013\u00a0through an exploration of the ethno-anthropological work of Giuseppe Pitr\u00e8 (1841\u20131916), and, in particular, his Mostra Etnografica Siciliana at Palermo's 1891\u20132 Esposizione Nazionale. Sicily's historical engagement with Arab culture and its geographical and cultural proximity to Africa are a backdrop for this study. The related, often derogatory, analogy between Sicily and Africa are also considered in the context of Italy's vainglorious colonial ventures in east Africa.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36155942, "asset_id": 10022165, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24398957, "first_name": "Vivien", "last_name": "Greene", "domain_name": "guggenheim", "page_name": "VivienGreene", "display_name": "Vivien Greene", "profile_url": "https://guggenheim.academia.edu/VivienGreene?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24398957/19348859/19269242/s65_vivien.greene.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 80854, "name": "Sicily", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sicily?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1149587, "name": "Giuseppe Pitr\u00e8", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Giuseppe_Pitre?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 23908958, "title": "Fuck Neoliberalism", "created_at": "2016-04-01T07:33:34.667-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/23908958/Fuck_Neoliberalism?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_23908958", "summary": "Yep, fuck it.

Esta transformaci\u00f3n demogr\u00e1fica ha provocado m\u00faltiples cambios en la sociedad estadounidense, que se ha visto forzada a repensar muchos aspectos sociales, como los de clase social, inmigraci\u00f3n o raza. De este modo, el conflicto entre los sistemas raciales imperantes en Estados Unidos y en Am\u00e9rica Latina ha sumido, durante a\u00f1os, en un profundo silencio a los latinos de color. Por lo tanto, este estudio pretende construir, en primer lugar, un marco de discusi\u00f3n sobre la situaci\u00f3n actual de los afro-latinos en los Estados Unidos.

In addition to looking at women students and students of color, we also examine the effects of social class on educational opportunity and performance, hypothesizing that access to financial capital is correlated to student success. In recognition of class-related structural oppression, this study introduces the framework of Freirean critical theory and other anti-oppressive frameworks as lenses through which we observe and analyze student experiences and outcomes.\n\nWe pursue a quantitative study in which we investigate engineering student outcomes based on reported gender, ethnicity, and household income level. Dependent variables include degree completion rates, time to graduation, and grade point average after the first four semesters of study. We find that students of color and working class students experience lower rates of graduation , prolonged time to degree, and lower grade point averages than students who do not fall into either of these categories. These results are heavily influenced by the intersectionality of students of color and working class students, as the two groups largely overlap both in the United States population and in the engineering student body at this institution.\n\nThe results support liberative theoretical claims that societal structures, such as patriarchalism, racism, and capitalism, have filtering effects that impact the opportunities available to individuals with marginalized identities throughout their lives. As incremental interventions fail to address the roots of these problems, they cannot entirely remove the debilitating obstacles facing students from marginalized identity groups; the only true solution lies in liberation from oppressive social structures. In accordance with critical and liberative theories, engineering educators can and should contribute to liberative efforts by employing pedagogical methods that challenge structural oppression.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65031314, "asset_id": 44553916, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 131472087, "first_name": "Corin", "last_name": "Bowen", "domain_name": "calstatela", "page_name": "CorinBowen", "display_name": "Corin L .

Using the London Borough of Newham as a case study, it will argue that contradictory definitions of the term have, until recently, been used to justify the erosion of the third sector in the borough, specifically groups who support religious and linguistic minorities. Interviews and documentary analysis are used to consider how the concept of resilience had a racializing effect in this borough, and we argue that as a facet of policy resilience risks treating plurality as a threat rather than a strength. This is highlighted through an examination of how the third sector was characterised as retarding individuals\u2019 resilience and promoting \u2018ethno-centrism\u2019 in official resilience discourse. We offer three distinctive insights on the problem of resilience as a feature of policy, firstly, that resilience has a symbolic power that makes it difficult to securitize; secondly, resilience discourses risk instituting racism within policy; and thirdly, that resilience is built against collective forms of resistance and is therefore incapable of harnessing the resources and capacities of local populations. To conclude, we discuss the evolving political situation in the borough and the demise of the administration promoting resilience, through collective forms of resistance.

The Scottish National Party (SNP) has held the reins of power at Holyrood since 2007. By the end of the SNP's third term in office they will have been in government for more than a decade. With the opinion polls suggesting that victory was all but assured, BBC Newsnight facilitated a discussion prior polling day about whether the SNP had become part of the 'political establishment'. This debate gathered more pace following the First Minister Nicola Sturgeonbeing photographed with a copy of The Sun. In considering this question there is an important area of debate, which is all too often relegated to the periphery of Scottish politics that we might want to consider: the SNP's record on tackling both racism and ethnic inequality. Here there are several ways that we can assess whether the SNP are similar to Labour and the Conservatives: the party's rhetoric; racism within the SNP; ethnic minority representation in the party and the Scottish government; and the progress the SNP have made in terms of tackling both racism and ethnic inequality after two full terms in office. In the years preceding the 2015 referendum on Scottish independence, Alex Salmond and the SNP have sought to articulate an inclusive Scottish nationalism which is all too often contrasted to a 'backward-looking' ethnic sense of Britishness. Such a contrast must be treated with considerable caution. Not only is the SNP's inclusive vision of Scottish nationalism a relatively recent phenomenon, it cannot be completely or cleanly separated from a historically founded imagining that equates Scottishness with whiteness. This can be traced back to the Scotland's role in Slavery and Empire. However, asBrendan McGeever notes, research has shown that 'Scottishness can indeed be imagined as something other than 'white'. In recent times the SNP have offered an important critical voice amidst the desperation and despair of the ongoing refugee crisis. This, of course, should be welcomed, if not commended. This has again reinforced the distinction between the SNP and the Conservative government's inhumane response which, if anything, has only stoked the flames of anti-immigrant political discourse. The SNP's opposition to the Conservative's was again evident after parliament voted down the attempt by MPs to force the British government to offer sanctuary to 3,000 unaccompanied child refugees in Europe. It is in this context that it is regrettable that the current constitutional setup sees Westminster retain control over immigration. Had the 2001 Scotland Act devolved control over immigration to the Scottish parliament, would the SNP maintain or dismantle the racist immigration laws introduced by Conservative and Labour governments in Westminster?

The results indicated that for youth from ethnic minority groups, the level of ethnic identity search component (a developmental and cognitive component) was higher compared to affirmation, belonging, and commitment component (an affective component). No significant difference was found between male and female students in these two components otherwise there was significant difference on the ethnic identity search component between college and high school students. In contrast, the score of ethnic identity search component of the majority group was lower compared to the score of affirmation, belonging, and commitment component. Significant differences were found between genders for the affirmation, belonging, and commitment component as well as between high school and college students for the ethnic identity search component.

We conducted a 10-year follow-up to Hall and Maramba\u2019s (2001) report of cross-cultural (CC) and ethnic minority (EM) publication trends. Comparing data from 1993\u20131999 and 2003\u20132009, we found that research on CC and EM issues continues to be underrepresented in the literature, particularly in top-tier journals. The American Psychological Association and Association for Psychological Science journals mirrored this discouraging trend, and the absence of top CC and EM authors on their editorial boards may point to a structural barrier to broader inclusion of cultural diversity research. We also found that fewer top CC and EM researchers are employed in psychology departments than one might hope, reflecting predominant attitudes within psychology of CC and EM research as peripheral to the larger field. Although clear that few gains have been made despite numerous awareness-raising efforts, the precise deficits were somewhat obscured, because the CC and EM terminology employed by Hall and Maramba (2001) did not fully capture the breadth of cultural diversity research currently underway in psychology. Thus, future attempts to assess the field would benefit from wider-reaching search terms. Additionally, we suggest that attention to reorganization within the evolving fields of cultural diversity research and to developing new categories of inquiry for research on cultural diversity that maintain focus on minority statuses in the United States may be productive routes forward for psychology as a discipline.

Suite \u00e0 l\u2019effondrement de son mariage, il a cependant quitt\u00e9 la r\u00e9gion et form\u00e9 une nouvelle famille, cette fois avec une femme aborig\u00e8ne. De ces deux mariages sont issues deux \u00ab branches \u00bb d\u2019une famille \u2013 l\u2019une dans le monde aborig\u00e8ne, l\u2019autre dans le monde \u00ab europ\u00e9en \u00bb \u2013 dont les destins sociaux contrast\u00e9s permettent d\u2019appr\u00e9hender avec un regard nouveau les transformations des relations raciales en Australie du Sud-Est, marqu\u00e9es par l\u2019av\u00e8nement, au XXe si\u00e8cle, d\u2019une dichotomie rigide s\u00e9parant \u00ab Noirs \u00bb et \u00ab Blancs \u00bb.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 602565, "asset_id": 205906, "asset_type": "Work",

Para organizar os principais temas envolvidos nessa pesquisa, o artigo est\u00e1 dividido em tr\u00eas partes.

Adopting Bauman\u2019s notion of a sociology of interpreters, a further suggestion is that this type of sociology needs to be reflexive and affective.

A fleet of intellectuals stand against the biased, colonial descriptions of the \"colored colonies\". Since the human body is not exempt from the prejudices of the colonial enterprise, impressive amount of ink has been spelt on dismantling the \"Utopian\" portrayal of the White/Black phenotype. By alienating the man of color's physique, a Manichaean division of functions is set through a series of accounts circling around the perfections of the white body. The black is condemned guilty of a sin he does not commit and judged by a shape he does not choose. The black man-the different, the other or the exotic are interchangeable words to address the black man according to the white-is doomed because of his body. As Edward Said puts it, \"the crime was that the Oriental was an oriental\" (Said, 1979:39). The Western cultural industry, with its colonial arsenal, succeeds in proposing an ideal life and a perfect shape of body and existence on the colored in order to pursue. Intellectuals, like Fanon, are obliged to state that the \"for the black man there is one destiny. And it is white\" (Fanon, 1986:12). Fanon's statement is realistic and ironic at the time. The black man orlay is embodied in getting to grips with his \"whiteness\" where he sees his liberation from his \"flesh prison\". Fanon's idea plays on two facts: white men think of themselves superior to black men and black men feel inferior to white men. The man of color wants to turn his race white through the mimicry of the \"pure race\"; the white race. That is the reality of quote. The ironic side resides in the use of two opposed terms in a dichotomic manner. Fanon employs the concepts of \"black\" and \"white\" which are totally opposed. Most often distinctive features are drawn between two things that are closely similar, but in this case, it is impossible to think of a black man being white and achieving sameness in any way. It is ironic to take the faith that the black has a chance to become white by all means since the racial differences are rampant. The colonial discourse makes the issue of racism a purely linguistic phenomenon. Accordingly, Spanish linguist Nibraja states that \"Language has always been a companion of empire\".", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58883709, "asset_id": 38793304, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 95753716, "first_name": "Abdallah", "last_name": "Bissi", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AbdallahBissi", "display_name": "Abdallah Bissi", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AbdallahBissi?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/95753716/25595460/24305175/s65_abdallah.bissi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13995, "name": "Postcolonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Theory?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 15863, "name": "Postcolonial Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Literature?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 37171723, "title": "Que alegria a palavra de Yahweh tamb\u00e9m veio \u00e0 mulher: uma an\u00e1lise eco-feminista de Gn 16 .pdf", "created_at": "2018-08-02T16:08:56.456-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37171723/Que_alegria_a_palavra_de_Yahweh_tamb%C3%A9m_veio_%C3%A0_mulher_uma_an%C3%A1lise_eco_feminista_de_Gn_16_pdf?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_37171723", "summary": "Genesis 16 gives us a different meeting between women, waters and the sacred.

Her ebony skin colour and concluded predisposed eroticism is evidenced throughout history in tourist advertisements and various forms of marketing campaigns stemming from out of the Caribbean. This has left her labelled by the impressions of tourists and outsiders who are attracted to the ideas of her beauty like a sailor to the siren. The mulata exemplifies an alluring notion of the Caribbean as something \"different,\" a female Caliban that is left to battle the colonization of prejudice and preconceptions arriving from abroad. This presentation aims to shed recognition on these stereotypes placed upon afro-latinas and analyze the modern consequences of the mulata complex in Latin American culture. It addresses the influence that the mulata complex has had on tourism, interracial relationships, gender equality, and racial identity throughout the Latin-American Caribbean.

book is a critical study of social housing in the UK between 1997 and 2010. In that period, following the riots in 2001 in some northern cities in England, the government of Tony Blair crafted the policy of community cohesion around the importance of social capital, and focused their housing policies on making social housing a vehicle of community cohesion. Dr Kemi Atanda Ilori examines this policy initiative as it developed in certain housing locales in Bradford, one of the cities affected by the riots in 2001. Exploring key theories in social capital, particularly, Putnam\u2019s and governmentality, particularly, Foucault\u2019s, Ilori argues that the experiences of residents in racially mixed social housing locales appear to suggest that social housing as a vehicle of community cohesion can only succeed when residents in racially segregated communities de-emphasise the ethnic and cultural barriers that wall them in and keep others out. For this they need interculturalism, not multiculturalism.\n\nDr Ilori was the Head of Housing and later Director of Housing Services at Manningham Housing Association in Bradford from 2002 until 2011. During his tenure, the housing services of the Association received commendation from the Chartered Institute of Housing, the National Housing Federation and the Federation of Black Housing Organisations. For instance, he led the Association\u2019s housing services partnership arrangement with William Sutton Housing which was so successful and was cited as an example of Best Practice by the National Housing Federation in 2006; the partnership with Incommunities around community cohesion earned a joint runners-up GOLD award for the entries on community cohesion by the Housing Corporation in 2007; the partnership with HACT, other registered providers and the local authority on Accommodate \u2013 a refugee integration partnership \u2013 was highly rated within the region in 2007. The Association\u2019s housing services\u2019 work with residents in tackling social exclusion and community building was cited at various CIH regional seminars and recognised by other registered providers between 2006 and 2008.\n\nDr Ilori has published on Nigerian drama and theatre. His latest poetry volume, Wole Soyinka and Other Poems, was published in 2014. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51956803, "asset_id": 31633595, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 783694, "first_name": "Dr. Kemi Atanda", "last_name": "Ilori", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DrKemiAtandaIlori", "display_name": "Dr. Kemi Atanda Ilori", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DrKemiAtandaIlori?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/783694/265529/18597854/s65_dr._kemi_atanda.ilori.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9252, "name": "Housing Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Housing_Policy?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47281, "name": "Social Housing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Housing?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 27565484, "title": "A multikulturalizmus nyom\u00e1ban - Amin \u00e9s az idegenek t\u00e1rsadalma", "created_at": "2016-08-05T10:24:52.146-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27565484/A_multikulturalizmus_nyom%C3%A1ban_Amin_%C3%A9s_az_idegenek_t%C3%A1rsadalma?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_27565484", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47819770, "asset_id": 27565484, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9165736, "first_name": "Szil\u00e1rd J\u00e1nos", "last_name": "T\u00f3th", "domain_name": "mtaki", "page_name": "Szil\u00e1rdJ\u00e1nosT\u00f3th", "display_name": "Szil\u00e1rd J\u00e1nos T\u00f3th", "profile_url": "https://mtaki.academia.edu/Szil%C3%A1rdJ%C3%A1nosT%C3%B3th?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9165736/3104483/38287502/s65_szil_rd_j_nos.t_th.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5527, "name": "Knowledge sharing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Knowledge_sharing?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8189, "name": "Politics of Recognition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_Recognition?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 17656, "name": "Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 65470, "name": "City and Regional Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/City_and_Regional_Planning?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 233814, "name": "Sociology of the stranger", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_the_stranger?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 330133, "name": "Strangerness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Strangerness?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 505459, "name": "Strangers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Strangers?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1246949, "name": "Ash Amin", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ash_Amin?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 25791111, "title": "F\u00f6rorten brinner!

overcoming the fallout of centuries of slavery in the United States and conjuring up the specter of state-enforced apartheid in South Africa, \u201csegregation\u201d nowadays appears to be almost ubiquitously condemned, but at the same time seemingly impossible to eradicate. Looking at (primarily urban, spatial, ethnic) segregation from a global angle, this seminar will reveal that the phenomenon has indeed plagued a great many societies since 1500, albeit in varying degrees and changing forms. Starting from recent arguments by historians (esp. Nightingale 2012) that segregation was primarily the result of state action, this seminar looks beyond the classic cases of the U.S. and South Africa in order to ask to what extent we should understand segregation as a side effect of the history of increasing global connectedness. Moving from rarely studied examples, such as 17th-century Ayutthaya, to better-known cases of late 19th-century Atlantic immigration cities, such as Buenos Aires, the seminar thus seeks to tease out the reasons and consequences of urban ethnic unmixing through wide-ranging comparisons.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35131282, "asset_id": 8780022, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 77538, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Goebel", "domain_name": "graduateinstitute", "page_name": "MichaelGoebel", "display_name": "Michael Goebel", "profile_url": "https://graduateinstitute.academia.edu/MichaelGoebel?f_ri=5453", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 134, "name": "Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 261, "name": "Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geography?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 262, "name": "Human Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Geography?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1362, "name": "Spatial Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spatial_Analysis?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2937, "name": "Diasporas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diasporas?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3210, "name": "Segregation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Segregation?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3410, "name": "Urban History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3843, "name": "Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4125, "name": "Global cities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_cities?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4808, "name": "Urban Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Planning?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 13334, "name": "Global History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 16472, "name": "Transnational migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_migration?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 54259, "name": "Cities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cities?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 64178, "name": "Spatial segregation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spatial_segregation?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 8422362, "title": "Review of Lee Bebout, Mythohistorical Interventions: The Chicano Movement and Its Legacies", "created_at": "2014-09-21T07:52:03.571-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8422362/Review_of_Lee_Bebout_Mythohistorical_Interventions_The_Chicano_Movement_and_Its_Legacies?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_8422362", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34813969, "asset_id": 8422362, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6628864, "first_name": "Roberto D.", "last_name": "Hern\u00e1ndez", "domain_name": "sdsu", "page_name": "RobertoDHern\u00e1ndez", "display_name": "Roberto D.

Through iconic characteristics of confidence and wit, Bond\u2019s image as a debonair Englishman has been carefully orchestrated and upheld. For this, much credit is due to the many secondary characters who exist primarily to index him as the ideal man, often at their expense. To achieve this, the films frequently employ methods of othering, particularly through exaggerating racial identities to the point of exoticization. While accusations that the Bond film series is riddled with racial stereotypes are not new, there exist gaps in scholarship addressing East Asian presence and stereotypes. This paper investigates (mis)representations of East Asian characters, examining them separately as allies and villains, through analyzing processes which mediatize their languages and cultures. Ultimately, it confronts the mediatization processes of East Asia within the Bond film series and explores the social meanings enregistered therein.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57783462, "asset_id": 36639249, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83236104, "first_name": "Mie", "last_name": "Hiramoto", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MHiramoto", "display_name": "Mie Hiramoto", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MHiramoto?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/83236104/65842624/54185268/s65_mie.hiramoto.png"}, {"id": 2402476, "first_name": "Phoebe", "last_name": "Pua", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PhoebePua", "display_name": "Phoebe Pua", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PhoebePua?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2402476/4123256/39613841/s65_phoebe.pua.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 934, "name": "Media and Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1555, "name": "Film Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2524, "name": "Sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 8223, "name": "East Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Asian_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 57138, "name": "James Bond", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/James_Bond?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 80944, "name": "Mediatization (Communication Studies)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mediatization_Communication_Studies_?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 8086527, "title": "Badder than \u201cJust a Bunch of SPEDs\u201d: Alternative Schooling and Student Resistance to Special Education Rhetoric", "created_at": "2014-08-25T21:08:27.558-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8086527/Badder_than_Just_a_Bunch_of_SPEDs_Alternative_Schooling_and_Student_Resistance_to_Special_Education_Rhetoric?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_8086527", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34537744, "asset_id": 8086527, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 15641279, "first_name": "Sarah", "last_name": "Becker", "domain_name": "lsu", "page_name": "SarahBecker", "display_name": "Sarah Becker", "profile_url": "https://lsu.academia.edu/SarahBecker?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/15641279/4247198/4941352/s65_sarah.becker.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1062, "name": "Special Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Special_Education?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26743, "name": "Intersectionality and Social Inequality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality_and_Social_Inequality?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 529447, "title": "Managers of choice: Race, gender, and the political ideology of the \u0093new\u0094 urban school leadership", "created_at": "2011-04-14T14:35:06.500-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/529447/Managers_of_choice_Race_gender_and_the_political_ideology_of_the_new_urban_school_leadership?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_529447", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 2892623, "asset_id": 529447, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 402069, "first_name": "Janelle", "last_name": "Scott", "domain_name": "berkeley", "page_name": "JanelleScott", "display_name": "Janelle T Scott", "profile_url": "https://berkeley.academia.edu/JanelleScott?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/402069/1006368/34743300/s65_janelle.scott.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 975, "name": "Sex and Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sex_and_Gender?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3512, "name": "Educational Inequalities (class;

Without race data, they have trouble making comparisons across groups. However, dropping \"race unknown\" students from analyses potentially introduces bias into conclusions. There is little methodological discussion about how to proceed when faced with large numbers of missing student ethnoracial data. An important but so far unstudied question is: what are the characteristics of those college students that end up in the \"race unknown\" category? This research note examines how these students compare to others who do provide a racial identification to get a better sense of how counting or not counting these students may affect results. Additionally, using students' responses to two different questions about racial identification, we are able to examine differences within the proportion of students who might be counted as \"race unknown.\" Our results suggest that Multiracial and White students make up significant percentages of \"race unknown\" college students in surveys.

Sandra Cisneros\u2019 Caramelo and Jeffrey Eugenides\u2019 Middlesex, published in the same year, address the issue of America\u2019s anxiety with its national identity and ethnic identity, while both geographical and gender borders are crossed. Going along the postmodern concern of truth-value in any kind of narrative, be it historical, biographical or fictional, these two novels presented as \u201cmemoirs\u201d joyfully blend, in their own idiosyncratic ways, historical facts, family history and anecdotes, and fictionalized narratives. Gloria Anzald\u00faa\u2019s \u201cfacultad\u201d and Jacques Derrida\u2019s \u201cdiff\u00e9rance\u201d will form the theoretical frame through which we will be reading the novels as aesthetic and ethic objects opening a third space that militates against binary oppressions. The indecisiveness of these categories will thus resist an essentialist politics and evade a simple binary in matters of national identity, literary genre, gender and sexual identity, to name but a few. These narratives question the truth-value of memoirs as they re-imagine the possibilities of story-telling; they subvert temporal rules through their reappropriation of the genre, reinventing stories and re-writing history as \u201cerotohistoriography\u201d, as coined by Elizabeth Freeman. This study proposes to bring together for the first time Caramelo and Middlesex and to use cross-ethnic studies alongside queer theory as a powerful tool outside of what we usually think of as \u201cqueer\u201d literature, and looks at convergences between those two novels where they have been overlooked before.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54790547, "asset_id": 34929037, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 70308640, "first_name": "Morgane", "last_name": "Flahault", "domain_name": "indiana", "page_name": "MorganeFlahault", "display_name": "Morgane Flahault", "profile_url": "https://indiana.academia.edu/MorganeFlahault?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/70308640/18089452/18085253/s65_morgane.flahault.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13157, "name": "Queer Theory (Literature)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Theory_Literature_?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20985, "name": "Memoir and Autobiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memoir_and_Autobiography?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21902, "name": "Time Perception", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Time_Perception?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 32589039, "title": "Un g\u00e9nocide annonc\u00e9 des \u00ab n\u00e8gres blancs d' Am\u00e9rique \u00bb ?", "created_at": "2017-04-22T12:47:27.900-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32589039/Un_g%C3%A9nocide_annonc%C3%A9_des_n%C3%A8gres_blancs_d_Am%C3%A9rique_?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_32589039", "summary": "Dans une lettre intitul\u00e9e \u00ab G\u00e9nocide, dites-vous\u2026\u00bb parue dans Le Devoir du 23 mars, l'ex-juge Andr\u00e9 Denis a estim\u00e9 opportun de dresser un parall\u00e8le entre le \u00abQu\u00e9bec-bashing\u00bb d'un Andrew Potter et cette immense \u00abfaillite de l'humanit\u00e9\u00bb que repr\u00e9sente le g\u00e9nocide des Tutsi du Rwanda, selon l\u2019expression de Rom\u00e9o Dallaire.

Through a case study of the National Junior Challenge Cup (now know as the JP McGuire Cup), the country\u2019s oldest ongoing competition across all youth sports, this paper examines the transformation of American soccer\u2019s identity. The tournament began in 1935 and evolved from an initial constituency of ethnic, immigrant and Catholic youth clubs. Following societal demographic trends, the growing national participant\nbase came from more suburban, middle-class neighbourhoods. The 1970s witnessed a paradigm change in youth soccer as the sport began to move closer to mainstream consciousness. The tournament is a window into the complexity of defining the term \u2018ethnic\u2019 and its individuals who straddled both \u2018ethnic\u2019 and \u2018native\u2019 worlds.

Answering these requires re-establishing lost connections and meeting family one previously did not know.

"Race and religion matter mightily in America.  The United States is defined by a durable and bitter history and complicated and multi-faceted religious history.  Those histories merge at highly visible and historical moments in events such as the abolition movement, the rise and reorganization of the Ku Klux Klan, and the civil rights movement in its struggle for the soul of America.  At times religion and race operate as two interconnected and co-creative social forces contributing to the production and maintenance of both an oppressive racialized society and an organizational and ethical basis for challenging and resisting racial oppression.  This chapter seeks to place these braided historical realities of religion and race in America in the foreground.  Examining United States religious history provides a perspective on religion's role as a powerful force and vital platform for the invention of race, the construction of racism, and the imposition of racial oppression.

Interpreting this cultural work as a kind of 'archive' of race, nation and ethnicity as was understood by his contemporary reading public, gives us the unique opportunity to examine how they continue to inform British identity and also remain critical to the formation of colonial and postcolonial identities around the globe.

Spirit in the Fourth Gospel? This study not only reviews the role of ethnicity and race in the ancient world; it also proposes a bold new understanding of Johannine pneumatology. From an ethnocritical perspective, this study argues that the Spirit was articulated for an ethnically diverse Johannine community that was dealing with the issues of race relations. The Spirit is the divine breath of God that commissions Jesus for the redemption of all ethnicities. The Spirit is involved in the maternal birth of all ethnic members who are in the family of God. The Spirit draws all people despite their ethnic lineage and heritage. And the Spirit is actively involved as an advocate for the minoritized community undergoing synagogue violence. Will the members of the Johannine community still hold onto ethnic ideologies of dehumanization that were prevalent of their age? Can the Johannine community still have the Spirit and support ideologies of ethnic division and hate? This study seeks to answer these questions.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67799277, "asset_id": 41467860, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35253232, "first_name": "Rodolfo", "last_name": "Estrada", "domain_name": "regent", "page_name": "RodolfoEstrada", "display_name": "Rodolfo Estrada", "profile_url": "https://regent.academia.edu/RodolfoEstrada?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/35253232/10239547/90343779/s65_rodolfo.estrada.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10714, "name": "Pneumatology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pneumatology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46362, "name": "Gospel of John", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gospel_of_John?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 9767650, "title": "Diluted Race and Female Presence in Zadie Smith's Hanwell in Hell", "created_at": "2014-12-14T10:58:20.205-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9767650/Diluted_Race_and_Female_Presence_in_Zadie_Smiths_Hanwell_in_Hell?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_9767650", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35947196, "asset_id": 9767650, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8150602, "first_name": "Anna", "last_name": "Kozak", "domain_name": "utoronto", "page_name": "AnnaKozak", "display_name": "Anna  Kozak", "profile_url": "https://utoronto.academia.edu/AnnaKozak?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8150602/2814588/3627389/s65_anna.kozak.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8, "name": "Critical Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15, "name": "British Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Literature?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 885, "name": "English Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Literature?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1192, "name": "Feminist Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminist_Theory?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 8444, "name": "Modernist Literature (Literary Modernism)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modernist_Literature_Literary_Modernism_?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 10453, "name": "Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 12760, "name": "Postcolonial Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Feminism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 29108, "name": "Feminist Literary Theory and Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminist_Literary_Theory_and_Gender_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 59676, "name": "Zadie Smith", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zadie_Smith?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 10061666, "title": "The need to remember, the desire to forget: Parihaka, race, and national melancholy in Aotearoa/New Zealand", "created_at": "2015-01-07T15:08:53.343-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10061666/The_need_to_remember_the_desire_to_forget_Parihaka_race_and_national_melancholy_in_Aotearoa_New_Zealand?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_10061666", "summary": "In 1881, colonial troops invaded, occupied, and forcefully evacuated the Maori village of Parihaka.  Located on the west coast of the North Island of Aotearoa/New Zealand in the shadow of Mt. Taranaki, a location of great spiritual importance for west coast Maori, Parihaka at the time of its invasion had become a symbol of Maori resistance to an increasingly aggressive colonial administration bent on freeing up as much land as possible for European settlement.  \nThis paper considers contemporary representations of the story of Parihaka and asks why it continues to haunt the collective memory of Aotearoa/New Zealand.  Why is it that Parihaka is referred to as an event that has been forgotten within the popular imagination, when the story continues to be told and retold in literature, histoy, art and film?  \nI will argue that despite claims to having been forgotten, the proliferation of representations of Parihaka attests to its status as a source of not only racial, but national melancholia.  In other words, Parihaka represents the intrusion of Aotearoa/New Zealand\u2019s colonial past, a past characterized by racism and ethnocentrism on the part of the British colonial administration, into the present.  The story of Parihaka serves as a constant reminder to Maori and Pakeha alike that the racial and ethnic divisions that characterized Aotearoa/New Zealand\u2019s colonial past continue to structure the present, despite the state\u2019s claims to have moved beyond such divisions.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36189063, "asset_id": 10061666, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 176434, "first_name": "Steven", "last_name": "Kensinger", "domain_name": "umn", "page_name": "StevenKensinger", "display_name": "Steven A Kensinger", "profile_url": "https://umn.academia.edu/StevenKensinger?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/176434/5278268/19665006/s65_steven.kensinger.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 35686, "name": "Trauma", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trauma?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 116108, "name": "New Zealand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Zealand?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 164026, "name": "Maori", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maori?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 7374557, "title": "Arresting Citizenship: The Democratic Consequences of American Crime Control", "created_at": "2014-06-17T03:07:35.132-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7374557/Arresting_Citizenship_The_Democratic_Consequences_of_American_Crime_Control?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_7374557", "summary": "The numbers are staggering: One-third of America\u2019s adult population has passed through the criminal justice system and now has a criminal record. Many more were never convicted, but are nonetheless subject to surveillance by the state. Never before has the American government maintained so vast a network of institutions dedicated solely to the control and confinement of its citizens.\n \nA provocative assessment of the contemporary carceral state for American democracy, Arresting Citizenship argues that the broad reach of the criminal justice system has fundamentally recast the relation between citizen and state, resulting in a sizable\u2014and growing\u2014group of second-class citizens. From police stops to court cases and incarceration, at each stage of the criminal justice system individuals belonging to this disempowered group come to experience a state-within-a-state that reflects few of the country\u2019s core democratic values. Through scores of interviews, along with analyses of survey data, Amy E. Lerman and Vesla M. Weaver show how this contact with police, courts, and prisons decreases faith in the capacity of American political institutions to respond to citizens\u2019 concerns and diminishes the sense of full and equal citizenship\u2014even for those who have not been found guilty of any crime. The effects of this increasingly frequent contact with the criminal justice system are wide-ranging\u2014and pernicious\u2014and Lerman and Weaver go on to offer concrete proposals for reforms to reincorporate this large group of citizens as active participants in American civic and political life.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50165635, "asset_id": 7374557, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13016883, "first_name": "Vesla", "last_name": "Weaver", "domain_name": "johnshopkins", "page_name": "VeslaWeaver", "display_name": "Vesla M Weaver", "profile_url": "https://johnshopkins.academia.edu/VeslaWeaver?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13016883/3676476/18876646/s65_vesla.weaver.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 537, "name": "Criminal Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminal_Justice?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 80016, "name": "Police and Policing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Police_and_Policing?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 2571970, "title": "\u00abCHRISTIAN NATIONS\u00bb?

Long Le-Khac explores the work of writers such as Sandra Cisneros, Karen Tei Yamashita, Junot D\u00edaz, and Aimee Phan. He shows how their fictions capture the uneven economic opportunities of the post\u2013civil rights era, the Cold War as it exploded across Asia and Latin America, and the Asian and Latin American labor flows powering global capitalism today.\n\nRead together, Asian American and Latinx literatures convey astonishing diversity and untapped possibilities for coalition within the United States' fastest-growing immigrant and minority communities; to understand the changing shape of these communities we must see how they have formed in relation to each other. As the U.S. population approaches a minority-majority threshold, we urgently need methods that can look across the divisions and unequal positions of the racial system.

However, stigma and discrimination persists and undermines help-seeking, recovery and life chances. Mental illness prevalence is higher amongst communities that face multiple prejudices and disadvantages within society, including black and minority ethnic communities who may experience migration trauma, racism, acculturation and adverse social circumstances. This study examines beliefs, stigma and the effectiveness of existing national mental health campaigns with Pakistani, Indian and Chinese heritage communities in Scotland, UK, using community based participatory research. Community organisers were trained and supported to co-facilitate focus groups with 87 people using a range of languages. Whilst diversity within and between communities was apparent, important trends emerged. People with mental illness experience high levels of stigma from communities. Families experience significant associated stigma. This shame combines with culturally inappropriate services to reduce help seeking from mental health services, friends and families. Existing anti-stigma campaigns have failed to reach or engage with communities due to a combination of practical issues such as the use of inappropriate language, imagery and media, but also due to assuming western medical concepts of illness. Participants suggested a new model for national campaigns placing greater emphasis upon community development, cultural events, positive contact and dialogue with families, faith leaders and youth groups. National anti-stigma programmes must develop more effective partnerships with communities or risk magnifying existing inequalities.Despite a range of national programmes to address stigma towards people with mental illness, it remains as the major barrier to social inclusion for people with mental illness living in communities. Stigma is particularly severe if people have a mental illness and are also economically disadvantaged or face multiple stigmas. By adopting Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approaches with three black and ethnic minority communi- ties in Scotland, this study makes the case that stigma can only be understood and effectively addressed with reference to its socio-cultural context.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35874661, "asset_id": 9680986, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 630784, "first_name": "Lee", "last_name": "Knifton", "domain_name": "strathclyde", "page_name": "LeeKnifton", "display_name": "Lee Knifton", "profile_url": "https://strathclyde.academia.edu/LeeKnifton?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/630784/217755/16360068/s65_lee.knifton.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2827, "name": "Mental Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mental_Health?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4259, "name": "Stigma", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stigma?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7125, "name": "Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7467, "name": "Sociology of Mental Health & Illness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Mental_Health_and_Illness?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 35141, "name": "Mental Illness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mental_Illness?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 92589, "name": "Stigma and Discrimination of Mental Illness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stigma_and_Discrimination_of_Mental_Illness?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 3779684, "title": "The Troubled Dream of Genetic Medicine: Ethnicity and Innovation in Tay Sachs, Cystic Fibrosis and Sickle Cell Disease", "created_at": "2013-06-24T13:20:41.306-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3779684/The_Troubled_Dream_of_Genetic_Medicine_Ethnicity_and_Innovation_in_Tay_Sachs_Cystic_Fibrosis_and_Sickle_Cell_Disease?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_3779684", "summary": "Why do racial and ethnic controversies become attached, as they often do, to discussions of modern genetics?

As liberal democracies have seen multi-party competition devolve into divisive, one dimensional verdicts on strong man politics and single issue referenda, so has public opinion scholarship never been more prominent or discussed. Brexit in the UK has been a boomtime for this kind of work. University of Manchester professors Maria Sobolewska and Robert Ford sit at the sober and most scholarly end of a highly visible and influential field of work, that runs from the technical boffinry of John Curtice on election night, via scholars such as Geoff Evans and Will Jennings echoing the \"blue left\" by charting the loss of the Labour heartlands, to the anti-liberal op. ed. provocations of Matthew Goodwin, Eric Kaufmann and David Goodhart. All of them seem to share a thirst for the media limelight: sometimes awkwardly combining \"data science\" with work close to the logic of media commentary and party strategising. Brexitland may stand as the capstone of a literature first launched by Ford's earlier volume with Goodwin, Revolt on the Right (2014): on the rise of UKIP, Nigel Farage, and the ripping apart and realignment of two party dominated British politics. Brexit, it argues, was the end point of a seismic shift in British politics that can be drawn right back through the post-war period.  Key to this view has been the emergence of what they see as a deeply rooted \"cultural war\" patterned essentially on the one raging on the other side of the Atlantic, with one crucial dimension \u2014 the variable salience over the decades of \"immigration\" as the wild card in British politics.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66237797, "asset_id": 46586951, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 15422744, "first_name": "Adrian", "last_name": "Favell", "domain_name": "leeds", "page_name": "AdrianFavell", "display_name": "Adrian Favell", "profile_url": "https://leeds.academia.edu/AdrianFavell?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/15422744/4383948/80516139/s65_adrian.favell.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 294, "name": "Ethnic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2613, "name": "Diversity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diversity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3843, "name": "Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4448, "name": "British Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Politics?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1425002, "name": "Brexit", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brexit?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 44500618, "title": "Religion and Labor in the 20th Century", "created_at": "2020-11-14T11:16:09.772-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44500618/Religion_and_Labor_in_the_20th_Century?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_44500618", "summary": "This extended encyclopedia entry was published in the \"Oxford Research Encyclopedia of American History\" in 2018", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64936493, "asset_id": 44500618, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34270469, "first_name": "Matthew", "last_name": "Pehl", "domain_name": "missouri", "page_name": "MatthewPehl", "display_name": "Matthew Pehl", "profile_url": "https://missouri.academia.edu/MatthewPehl?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/34270469/10043671/86658361/s65_matthew.pehl.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2057, "name": "Gilded Age and Progressive Era", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gilded_Age_and_Progressive_Era?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3651, "name": "Cold War and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cold_War_and_Culture?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12975, "name": "New Deal (U.S. history)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Deal_U.S._history_?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19415, "name": "Labor History and Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labor_History_and_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 62223, "name": "Working-Class History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Working-Class_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 960191, "name": "US Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/US_Religion?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 42021282, "title": "Review: Bruce D.

argue that the concept has become too diversified to have political or academic efficacy. The Geography of Gentrification research agenda attempts to save gentrification by studying it contextually to better understand it as a spatially and temporally nuanced phenomenon. This study contributes to the Geography of Gentrification by interrogating Lees\u2019 (1994) Atlantic Gap thesis: that there is an operational difference in gentrification between England and the US. It deploys a comparative study of Greater Manchester and San Francisco. In doing so, it deploys several strands of Geography of Gentrification research: addressing gentrification as a chaotic concept, examining the dynamics of race and utilising a relational critique. Rather than finding an Atlantic Gap, this study finds an Atlantic Connection.

Most profoundly, in each city renewal is fundamentally driven and shaped by wider paradigms of neoliberal and entrepreneurial governance that produce unequal class relations. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54883455, "asset_id": 35020061, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 70756192, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Rowan", "domain_name": "kcl", "page_name": "PeterRowan", "display_name": "Peter Rowan", "profile_url": "https://kcl.academia.edu/PeterRowan?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/70756192/83614979/72236912/s65_peter.rowan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 261, "name": "Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geography?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7455, "name": "Gentrification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gentrification?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 34663193, "title": "UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF SES, ETHNICITY, AND DISCIPLINE INFRACTIONS IN STUDENTS\u2019  STANDARDIZED TEST SCORES", "created_at": "2017-09-24T11:08:56.550-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34663193/UNDERSTANDING_THE_ROLE_OF_SES_ETHNICITY_AND_DISCIPLINE_INFRACTIONS_IN_STUDENTS_STANDARDIZED_TEST_SCORES?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_34663193", "summary": "The goal of the current study is to examine the impact of students\u2019 social economic status, ethnicity, and discipline infractions on their standardized test scores in Indiana, the USA. Data from this study extracted from Indiana Department of Education. ISTEP is a criterion-referenced standardized test. It consists of items that assess a student\u2019s performance with respect to particular criteria that was established by the Indiana State Board of Education. Criterion-referenced test scores help us to understand where a student stands in relation to the cut scores based Indiana Academic Standards in English/Language Arts and Mathematics. In fact, the application of ISTEP might be helpful for schools to identify their students\u2019 strengths and weaknesses in these content areas. By doing so, they take necessary steps to plan appropriate instruction for students\u2019 academic development. However, the Indiana Department of Education\u2019s statistical data show that there was a statistically significant achievement gap between students. Accordingly, the current study findings point out that the effects of SES and Race varied among groups. Specifically, African-American students with low SES status had lower scores on ISTEP than their white peers did. In addition, a chi-square analysis showed that disproportionality among African American students appeared to be striking. Findings and educational implications are discussed.

This qualitative study examines the ramifications of police infiltration and monitoring of Muslim student and community-based organizations. Drawing upon 24 months of ethnographic fieldwork among multiple research sites with Muslim secondary and college students in New York City, I examine how surveillance affected the relationships within communities utilizing notions of power, panoptic gaze, and governmentality. From the participatory action ethnographic study, which included this researcher's observations and field notes of meetings, forums, and workshops, and 25 semistructured interviews, key findings show that an insidious result of the New York Police Department's Demographics Unit has been an alarming rise in self-discipline behaviors amid a culture of fear and panoptic gaze as well as diminished intercommunity trust and sense of solidarity among these youth themselves. [ethnographic methods, Muslim students, identity, surveillance] On a summer morning in 2011, I awoke to a text message from Ishmael, a community activist in New York City. His message simply read, \" Check the news yet? This is big. \" On August 23, in the third week of Ramadan, the Associated Press (AP) first reported on the New York Police Department's (NYPD) program surveilling Muslim communities. Although countless stories of police spying had previously circulated within Muslim communities in the United States, and more than a handful of documented cases of surveillance had been established, the AP revealed secret NYPD documents that outlined a regional program, the NYPD Demographics Unit, designed to \" put American citizens under surveillance and scrutinized where they ate, prayed, and worked solely because of their ethnicity \" (Associated Press 2012). In addition to broadly spying on Muslim communities , the NYPD specifically targeted Muslim students on college campuses. In this paper I describe and analyze how Muslim students, with whom I engaged in a participa-tory action research project, navigated a New York City political context in which they attempted to resist police surveillance while they inhabited a social and cultural world in which members of their own communities spied on them. With ethnographic data from my own field notes of meetings, forums, and workshops, and 25 semistructured interviews , I discuss the way young Muslim activists made sense of these competing pressures. This study explores how state surveillance of Muslim student activists in New York City both affected the ways individuals related to one another and limited their political subjectivities, as well as how relationships shifted and questions arose around trust and political engagement throughout this community. I draw upon notions of power and panoptic gaze within this study, specifically Michel Foucault's theorization of governmentality. Through the concept of governmentality, I follow \" the point where power reaches into the very grain of individuals, touches their bodies and inserts itself into their actions and attitudes, their discourses, learning processes and everyday lives \" (Foucault 1980:39) in order to illuminate some of the tensions and complex realities young Muslims face as they develop political identities within a police state.

The term Nationalism is quite modern, but it was play crucial role in the last century of human history. Nationalism is kind of a belief, political ideology that it considers to five major principles; \u201ca) a process of formation, or growth, of nations , b) a sentiment or consciousness of belonging to the nation, c) a language and symbolism of the nation, d) a social and political movement on behalf of the nation, e) a doctrine and/or ideology of nation, both general and particular\u201d (Smith, 2010, pp.5-6). Another an important definition to define is racism because racism and nationalism are parallel theories. Also, \u2018racism\u2019 just leads to a categorization peoples from some properties such as gender, ethnicity, religious beliefs etc., but it focuses mainly external differences.  \nIn Turkey, the race issue starts the quest for Turkish national identity after the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, a secular Turkish national identity emerged with the revolution of M.

Class in an abstract sense is the relationship through which labor is mobilized into specific relations of production,  But the means through which such labor is categorized and mobilized  is historically diverse, and includes nationality/citizenship, race, gender, class in a more superficial sense, and so forth.  Thus, class in the setting of the U.S. southwest is enacted through race (Mexican/Anglo) and more recently nationality/immigration status (citizenship).  This helps to understand empirical material that borderlanders (most but not all U.S.-side in origin) tend to merge their class understandings of the border into a discourse of labor and poverty being Mexican (as previously documented by Pablo Vila).  Yet they do have some penetrations of deep class processes.

Yet, his failure to consider class, colonialism/postcolonialism and racism together often left him open to accusations of being a Eurocentric thinker. Bourdieu wrote in a time when immigration from former colonies was still relatively recent against the backdrop of an intellectual and political context that was nationally bounded and opposed the theoretical or political significance of ethnicity, particularly in France. In fact, survey questions that focused on ethnic identification were illegal in France; hence, the depiction of France as ethnically undifferentiated in Distinction (Bennett, et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nHowever, his early work on Algeria reveals that he was interested in the relations between ethnicity and colonialism. As did his expansion of the concept of cultural capital in his later work, which showed his concern over the cultural capital holdings that migrants had in a new era of globalisation and transnational movements of people. Puwar (2008) argues that the perception of Bourdieu in the UK as primarily a class theorist with little recognition of racism in France, may well be a consequence of the lack of translations of a considerable number of texts written by him on the subject in French. This is itself a significant insight into the prevalence of class in British sociology.  Recently, scholars have gradually started to apply a Bourdieusian approach to an increased extent when investigating class and migration.  Oliver and O\u2019Reilly (2010), for instance, apply a Bourdieusian approach in their case study of expatriates living in the Costa del Sol, Spain. In this study, Bourdieu\u2019s methodological approach as well as his sociological concepts are drawn upon to help understand the cultural processes and the reproduction of the economic positions of the emigrants.  As these scholars argue, Bourdieu\u2019s attempts to overcome dualism and see the interrelation between structure and action prove useful in their analyses of this migration case study. \r\n\r\nTimetable \r\n\r\n9.15-9.45          Registration and Refreshments \r\n9.45.10.00        Introduction \r\n10.00-11.15      Key Note: Prof. Karen O\u2019Reilly (Loughborough University) \r\n11.15-11.30      Comfort Break \r\n11.30-13.00      Presentations (3 papers) \r\n\r\n\u2022\tDr Michaela Benson (Goldsmiths) Embodying white privilege in lifestyle migration: habitus, field and the mutability of capitals \r\n\u2022\tDerron Wallace (University of Cambridge)  Between \u2018Bad\u2019 Blacks & \u2018Better\u2019 Blacks?: Exploring the Role of Black Cultural Capital in the Educational Experiences of Afro-Caribbean Youth in London and New York \r\n\u2022\tDr Barbara Samaluk (Queen Mary, University of London) Whiteness, ethnic privilege and migration: a Bourdieuian framework \r\n\r\n13.00-14.00      Lunch \r\n14.00-15.15      Key Note: Dr. Nirmal Puwar (Goldsmiths) \r\n15.15-15.45      Refreshment Break \r\n15.45-16.45      Workshop Discussions \r\n16.45-17.00      Closing Remarks \r\n\r\nRecommended Reading for the Event \r\n\r\nOliver, C and O\u2019Reilly (2010) A Bourdieusian Analysis of Class and Migration: habitus and the individualising process.

In Latin America, these descriptive gaps are particularly pronounced. A growing number of studies investigate the causes of racial disparities in representation, however, extant research largely focuses on national assemblies. In this paper, I extend this well-trod line of research to an understudied context, local elections. Using a dataset that covers mayoral elections in Brazil, I demonstrate that multiple factors hinder Afro-Brazilians, who comprise a majority of the Brazilian population, from winning public office. I show that barriers to candidate entry, resource disparities between white and Afro-Brazilian candidates, and race-based preferences among voters contribute to racial inequality in political representation. These results indicate that members of marginalized racial groups often must overcome multiple barriers to achieve electoral success.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68322521, "asset_id": 50276352, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31840647, "first_name": "Andrew", "last_name": "Janusz", "domain_name": "florida", "page_name": "AndrewJanusz", "display_name": "Andrew Janusz", "profile_url": "https://florida.academia.edu/AndrewJanusz?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31840647/69667594/58070724/s65_andrew.janusz.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 388, "name": "Latin American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1287, "name": "Political Parties", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Parties?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2431, "name": "Urban Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Politics?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2931, "name": "Afro Latin America", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Afro_Latin_America?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3778, "name": "Political Campaigns", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Campaigns?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 13280, "name": "Campaign Finance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Campaign_Finance?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 20366, "name": "Elections", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Elections?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 24176, "name": "Brazilian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brazilian_Politics?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 30936, "name": "Elections and Voting Behavior", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Elections_and_Voting_Behavior?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 56989, "name": "Latin America", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_America?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 131006, "name": "Campaigns and Elections", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Campaigns_and_Elections?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1372399, "name": "Political Parties Finance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Parties_Finance?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 40424938, "title": "Race, Space, Power: Mapping the global color line 2020", "created_at": "2019-09-23T11:06:25.355-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40424938/Race_Space_Power_Mapping_the_global_color_line_2020?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_40424938", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60681547, "asset_id": 40424938, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34503136, "first_name": "Leslie", "last_name": "Gross-Wyrtzen", "domain_name": "yale", "page_name": "LeslieGrossWyrtzen", "display_name": "Leslie Gross-Wyrtzen", "profile_url": "https://yale.academia.edu/LeslieGrossWyrtzen?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/34503136/17906041/19088798/s65_leslie.gross-wyrtzen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 294, "name": "Ethnic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 379, "name": "African Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 813618, "name": "Black Geographies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Geographies?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 33621726, "title": "Promoting Anne Moody: A 21-Point Plan for Sharing Her Story, Honoring Her Memory, and Keeping Her Legacy Alive", "created_at": "2017-06-23T06:53:16.367-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33621726/Promoting_Anne_Moody_A_21_Point_Plan_for_Sharing_Her_Story_Honoring_Her_Memory_and_Keeping_Her_Legacy_Alive?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_33621726", "summary": "#AnneMoody\n\nThis is an overview of the Anne Moody History Project (AMHP) and its plans to promote and help preserve the legacy of Anne Moody (1940 - 2015). Ms. Moody was a civil rights pioneer and the famous author of Coming of Age in Mississippi. She grew up in Centreville, Miss., where she overcame poverty, racism, persecution, and the threats of death. She became a respected leader in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nDrawing on the author's background in marketing and journalism, this document presents a list of practical ideas adapted by AMHP for promoting Ms. Moody's history. The ideas include promotional work through schools, churches, the local community, government agencies, social media, and the news media. In addition to honoring her with a street and highway bearing her name, AMHP plans call for having a proclamation issued for \u201cAnne Moody Day.\u201d The author, who serves as AMHP chairman, has said the promotional campaign is about \u201chistory, education and tourism.\u201d Current and future generations need to know her story, according to the author.\n\nNote: Readers are encouraged to

One could say that they are dependent on each other. Archaeologists use anthropological analogies from contemporary groups in the Maya area to explain their data and anthropologists sometime emphasize the originality of some social expressions as either modern, colonial or pre-Hispanic. Nowadays we have a third actor who criticizes both archaeology and anthropology. This is the Maya movement in Guatemala, led by indigenous scholars, who want to see a more ethical approach to the study of both the past and contemporary ethnic groups. In this text, I shall consider how ethnicity and culture are viewed in Maya archaeology and in this movement and see how they are both the result of a politicised, cultural thinking. The concept of material culture has a central position here, since it is believed to reflect past human culture and ethnicity.\r\n\r\nThis movement is like the negation of a discourse established by the other dominating party. As such, it is dependent on the former. When a new discourse is being constructed, it resists the dominating discourse or other opposing powers. When such constructed histories in their turn become the official histories of ethnic movements, they tend to be defined by the very same colonialism that they oppose. They use the same units of analysis, idioms and structures. The group is formed around this discourse and the result is what Fischer writes: \u201cIn many ways the pan-Maya movement is a textbook example of an imaged [sic] community\u201d (Fischer 2001:7).\r\n\r\nHowever, this is a result of a need to be heard. The movement has had to adopt a Western discourse. Archaeologists or other scholars from the \u201cThird World\u201d have had to work with concepts that were developed during the colonial era.

The Deportation Express is the first history of American deportation trains: a network of prison railroad cars repurposed by the Immigration Bureau to link jails, hospitals, asylums, and workhouses across the country and allow forced removal with terrifying efficiency. With this book, historian Ethan Blue uncovers the origins of the deportation train and finds the roots of the current moment, as immigrant restriction and mass deportation once again play critical and troubling roles in contemporary politics and legislation.\n\nA century ago, deportation trains made constant circuits around the nation, gathering so-called \"undesirable aliens\"\u2014migrants disdained for their poverty, political radicalism, criminal conviction, or mental illness\u2014and conveyed them to ports for exile overseas. Previous deportation procedures had been violent, expensive, and relatively ad hoc, but the railroad industrialized the expulsion of the undesirable. Trains provided a powerful technology to divide \"citizens\" from \"aliens\" and displace people in unprecedented numbers. Drawing on the lives of migrants and the agents who expelled them, The Deportation Express is history told from aboard a deportation train. By following the lives of selected individuals caught within the deportation regime, this book dramatically reveals how the forces of state exclusion accompanied epic immigration in early twentieth-century America. These are the stories of people who traveled from around the globe, only to be locked up and cast out, deported through systems that bound the United States together, and in turn, pulled the world apart. Their journey would be followed by millions more in the years to come.\n\nUniversity of California Press, 2021\n\nhttps://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520304444/the-deportation-express", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68183701, "asset_id": 50058630, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 68183594, "asset_id": 50058630, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2552753, "first_name": "Ethan", "last_name": "Blue", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "EthanBlue", "display_name": "Ethan  Blue", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/EthanBlue?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2552753/796228/48906490/s65_ethan.blue.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 189, "name": "Criminology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 390, "name": "American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1697, "name": "Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Violence?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2057, "name": "Gilded Age and Progressive Era", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gilded_Age_and_Progressive_Era?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2409, "name": "Mobility/Mobilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Mobilities?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2595, "name": "Critical Disability Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Disability_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2817, "name": "Border Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Border_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4374, "name": "Immigration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 13229, "name": "History Of Madness And Psychiatry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_Of_Madness_And_Psychiatry?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 13334, "name": "Global History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 15566, "name": "Genders and Sexualities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genders_and_Sexualities?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 18603, "name": "Immigrant Detention", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigrant_Detention?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 19089, "name": "United States History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/United_States_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 25870, "name": "Critical Prison Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Prison_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 36393, "name": "Settler Colonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_Colonial_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 77342, "name": "Infrastructure", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Infrastructure?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 102533, "name": "Deportation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deportation?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 467994, "name": "Carceral Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Carceral_Geography?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 700358, "name": "Racial capitalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_capitalism?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 43502664, "title": "RACE AND ETHNICITY", "created_at": "2020-07-02T14:08:00.732-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43502664/RACE_AND_ETHNICITY?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_43502664", "summary": "\u201cEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.\u201d \u2014William Butler Yeats (1889)\n\nWelcome to our course, \u201cRace and Ethnicity\u201d!  These are not, needless to say, normal circumstances. This is the first time in four decades of teaching that I am doing so \u201conline.\u201d  It may be a new experience for you as well.  There are bound to be glitches (not to mention Murphy\u2019s Law) as we adapt to the new conditions and challenges... but I have no doubt that we will overcome them together.  Our course, which begins on March 31, 2020, is being held in the context of the historic crisis we are all engulfed in, a once-in-a-century global pandemic that is not only bordering on a public health apocalypse but shaking all aspects of our lives and of our worlds (interpersonal, educational, occupational, financial, economic, political, residential, medical, social, cultural, psychological, familial)\u2014requiring adaptations to rapidly changing and unpredictable circumstances.  (Like this online course, for instance!)  It is precisely in such moments of crisis\u2014which shake our taken for granted notions and routines to their foundation, revealing the artifices of our social constructions of \u201creality\u201d (including what we construct as \u201crace\u201d and \u201cethnicity\u201d)\u2014that a sociological imagination flourishes.  A folk saying has it that \u201cwhen life gives you lemons, make lemonade.\u201d  I look forward to making sociological lemonade with you this quarter.  The pandemic will not hit everyone alike, but will be patterned along hard lines of social and economic inequality and disadvantage\u2014including race and ethnicity and immigration status.  Not everyone can \u201cstay at home.\u201d  Harsh realities are being exposed anew by this public health catastrophe... including the fact that SYSTEMIC RACISM IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE... along with possibilities to reshape the structure of our societies in the calamitous aftermath. (But as Frederick Douglass famously said long ago: \u201cPower concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.\u201d) \n\nWe will read 1 book during our 11-week course: Race in America, by Matthew Desmond and Mustafa Emirbayer.\nThis is one of the very best textbooks on the subject that I have seen. The book is made up of 11 chapters, each about 40 pages (including many images, maps and graphics); you\u2019ll be reading a chapter a week on average.  \nThe first 2 chapters spell out key concepts and address the historical invention and institutionalization of \u201crace.\u201d The next 8 core chapters (#3-10) focus on separate (but interconnected) fields of social life: political, economic, residential, legal, educational, aesthetic, associational, and intimate spheres (family, self, identity).  The last one, chapter 11, looks to the future: \u201cToward Racial Democracy.\u201d In addition to the text, you will read a few supplementary readings, listed in the syllabus and course agenda.  In tandem with the course readings, over the next ten weeks I will regularly email you selected articles, reports, and analyses seeking to connect what you are studying to the breaking news of the day; while we cannot know now what may come in the coming months, we can be pretty certain that the issues addressed by our course will be at the heart of the historic crisis (or crises) that will engulf us.  By the end of the class you will have effectively a \u201ccurated\u201d set of such accompanying relevant readings.\n\nTuesday March 31 is the start of our class.  Saturday April 4 marks the anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.  As I do every year at that time, as well as on the anniversary of his birth on January 15, I send my students an annual message of remembrance.  Please take time to read and reflect on it.\n\nThe goal of this class is to broaden your intellectual horizons; to study stress, not to cause it; to invite you to a memorable sociological adventure amid a global crisis that you and I will still be talking about many years from now.  And remember: Our course will end in June, but not our role and responsibility as members of the polis, as citizens as well as sociologists confronted by historic crises.  The critically informed citizen\u2014whose voice is heard, who acts and votes and remains civically engaged\u2014is racism\u2019s worst enemy.  Becoming a critically informed citizen, ending racial domination and making a more just world is a lifetime commitment that never ends.  Silence is not an option at this (potential) turning point in the history of American democracy and racial justice, even amid a once-in-a-century pandemic.  Know that history.  Voice that history.  Read-think-write... and act.\n\n\"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere...

Yet even while pointing to an apparent crisis in multiculturalism, the text of the apology, which is analyzed here, does not put the Canadian state\u2019s official multiculturalism policy into question. In seeking to offer redress, the official apology in effect functions as a tool of the state to manage the grief and grievance of racialized minorities, even as the state works toward increased surveillance of racialized minorities. Reading the apology in conjunction with two fictional remembrances of the Air India bombings, Bharati Mukherjee\u2019s 1988 short story \u201cThe Management of Grief\u201d and Anita Rau Badami\u2019s 2006 novel Can You Hear the Nightbird Call? , this essay addresses the politics of official apology/official multiculturalism.

This research aims to examine and elaborate further on the impacts of the mining MNCs in Bougainville on its environmental and humanitarian conditions and the correlation between the environmental damage and human rights issues created by MNCs. The Case of Bougainville Copper Limited is an extreme example of how MNC operations can mess up a country's internal security. In this case, the mistreatment and willful neglect of indigenous, environmental, human right violations and property rights gave Bougainville a legitimate reason to start a war. When an MNC fails to adjust its actions in relation to socioeconomic and political conditions, they are asking for trouble.

The same organization existed under several different names between 1925 and 1969. As perhaps the only sustained effort in New York by a black-led organization to focus specifically on the problems of blacks as both workers and trade unionists, the NLC evokes considerable interest. Drawing on the NLC's written records, this paper argues that the NLC's overarching loyalty to the labor movement led it to underestimate the efficacy of organizing blacks through community institutions toward goals defined in terms of the community's interest. Thus, the NLC sacrificed racial solidarity for trade union solidarity, only to find that most white unions in the American Federation of Labor (AFL) were more committed to the former than to the latter.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64874721, "asset_id": 44452107, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1726017, "first_name": "Joel", "last_name": "Stillerman", "domain_name": "gvsu", "page_name": "JoelStillerman", "display_name": "Joel  Stillerman", "profile_url": "https://gvsu.academia.edu/JoelStillerman?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1726017/594662/11324183/s65_joel.stillerman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 87786, "name": "New York City", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_York_City?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 214532, "name": "Communist Parties", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communist_Parties?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 260836, "name": "Labor and Trade Unionist Organizing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labor_and_Trade_Unionist_Organizing?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2694076, "name": "Socialist Parties ", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socialist_Parties?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 44228964, "title": "Neighborhood Context, Racial/Economic Privilege and Prominent U.S. Newspaper Coverage of Home Invasion Crime", "created_at": "2020-10-04T21:17:09.550-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44228964/Neighborhood_Context_Racial_Economic_Privilege_and_Prominent_U_S_Newspaper_Coverage_of_Home_Invasion_Crime?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_44228964", "summary": "While there are a handful of published studies that investigate the role of neighborhood characteristics in newspapers' portrayals of crime, such analyses are largely limited to studying the predictors of one type of crime (homicide) in individual city newspapers and typically decenter neighborhood level demographics by treating them as a set of control variables. The present study advances this work by foregrounding neighborhood context and presenting a large-scale quantitative analysis of how it influences prominent newspaper coverage of violent crime. Specifically, my Ordinary Least Squares and Poisson regression models test whether various zip code level characteristics predict the word counts of initial articles and the overall number of articles published on over 730 incidents of home invasion crime reported across fifteen U.S. city newspapers. I find that home invasion incidents in neighborhoods with a higher percentage of White residents or a lower percentage of Mexican American residents have significantly more words written about them, net of other theoretically important individual and situational variables. I also find that when home invasions take place in higher median income neighborhoods they have more overall articles written about them. These findings align with the 'law of opposites' perspective as increasingly White and wealthier neighborhoods 1 The author is grateful for the meticulous attention to detail shown by Carmen Hernandez (Southwestern University, Class of 2019) as she helped to match addresses with zip codes during the initial stage of this project.

In 2008, it was Hillary Clinton. In 1844, it was Martin Van Buren. And in neither election did the prominent Democrat win the party's nomination. Insurgent candidates went on to win the nomination and the presidency, plunging the two-party system into disarray over the years that followed.\n\nIn this book, Cedric de Leon analyzes two pivotal crises in the American two-party system: the first resulting in the demise of the Whig party and secession of eleven southern states in 1861, and the present crisis splintering the Democratic and Republican parties and leading to the election of Donald Trump. Recasting these stories through the actions of political parties, de Leon draws unsettling parallels in the political maneuvering that ultimately causes once-dominant political parties to lose the people's consent to rule.\n\nCrisis! takes us beyond the common explanations of social determinants to illuminate how political parties actively shape national stability and breakdown. The secession crisis and the election of Donald Trump suggest that politicians and voters abandon the political establishment not only because people are suffering, but also because the party system itself is unable to absorb an existential challenge to its power. Just as the U.S. Civil War meant the difference between the survival of a slaveholding republic and the birth of liberal democracy, what political elites and civil society organizations do today can mean the difference between fascism and democracy.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60871170, "asset_id": 40591806, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5652630, "first_name": "Cedric", "last_name": "de Leon", "domain_name": "umass", "page_name": "CedricdeLeon", "display_name": "Cedric  de Leon", "profile_url": "https://umass.academia.edu/CedricdeLeon?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5652630/2458919/78279059/s65_cedric.de_leon.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 201, "name": "Political Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Sociology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2864, "name": "U.S. history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/U.S._history?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4446, "name": "Antebellum South", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Antebellum_South?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6226, "name": "American Political Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Political_Development?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 8162, "name": "Southern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southern_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 12118, "name": "Great Depression", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Great_Depression?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 12420, "name": "Neoliberalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neoliberalism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 12975, "name": "New Deal (U.S. history)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Deal_U.S._history_?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14834, "name": "Gramsci", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gramsci?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 58640, "name": "Barack Obama", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Barack_Obama?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 79506, "name": "U.S. Political History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/U.S._Political_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 383222, "name": "Historical and Comparative Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_and_Comparative_Sociology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1250479, "name": "Donald Trump", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Donald_Trump?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1840038, "name": "Crisis of Hegemony", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Crisis_of_Hegemony?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 39971106, "title": "Failure by Design: How \u201cUrban Renewal\u201d Fueled an Uprising, and How \u201cEconomic Ecosystems\u201d May Prevent One", "created_at": "2019-07-30T09:10:05.113-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39971106/Failure_by_Design_How_Urban_Renewal_Fueled_an_Uprising_and_How_Economic_Ecosystems_May_Prevent_One?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_39971106", "summary": "An analysis of economic development strategy in West Baltimore n the 90s and how neoliberal economic theory produced the conditions leading to the Baltimore Uprising of 2015.\n\nConcludes with an analysis of how investing in indigenous Black run microenterprise is an alternative disruptive and counterproductive large scale neoliberal economic interventions in Black communitites.

Yet, the study of advanced science is often stratified by 'race' or ethnicity. This book draws across science education literature and sociology of education theories. It investigates how social identities of 'race' and ethnicity, social class and gender can shape minority ethnic students' views of, and aspirations toward, science through exploring the experiences of British Black Caribbean, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Indian and Pakistani young people. Is science for 'people like us'? This book engages with and extends our current conceptual thinking around aspiration, capital and identity, in the context of science. For instance, a distinction is made between careers in and from science as well as the educational discourses of 'being the best' and 'trying my best'. It contributes to ongoing discussions around 'science identity' and the emerging idea of 'science capital' along with the development of five 'types' of science participation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48848026, "asset_id": 23664622, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 295661, "first_name": "Billy", "last_name": "Wong", "domain_name": "reading", "page_name": "BillyWong", "display_name": "Billy Wong", "profile_url": "https://reading.academia.edu/BillyWong?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/295661/72915/42447804/s65_billy.wong.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 974, "name": "Sociology of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Education?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1557, "name": "Youth Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1736, "name": "Science Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_Education?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2190, "name": "Chinese Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3429, "name": "Educational Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Research?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 22198, "name": "Secondary Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Secondary_Education?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 115756, "name": "Aspirations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aspirations?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 885071, "name": "Parents Influence on Students Career Aspirations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Parents_Influence_on_Students_Career_Aspirations?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 20769361, "title": "Modernity, Time, and the Colonial Subject", "created_at": "2016-01-25T04:37:02.768-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/20769361/Modernity_Time_and_the_Colonial_Subject?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_20769361", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 41552039, "asset_id": 20769361, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 919649, "first_name": "Joseph", "last_name": "van der Naald", "domain_name": "gc-cuny", "page_name": "JosephvanderNaald", "display_name": "Joseph van der Naald", "profile_url": "https://gc-cuny.academia.edu/JosephvanderNaald?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/919649/390221/12032973/s65_joseph.van_der_naald.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 482018, "name": "Franz Fanon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Franz_Fanon?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 18736072, "title": "Remembering and Reclaiming the Genius of Beah Richards\u2019 A Black Woman Speaks\u2026 of White Womanhood, of White Supremacy, of Peace", "created_at": "2015-11-20T21:01:58.852-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/18736072/Remembering_and_Reclaiming_the_Genius_of_Beah_Richards_A_Black_Woman_Speaks_of_White_Womanhood_of_White_Supremacy_of_Peace?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_18736072", "summary": "Beah Richards is not a name that immediately comes to mind when one thinks of feminist theorists of the twentieth century. Yet, her 1951 poem A Black Woman Speaks of White Womanhood, of White Supremacy, of Peace contains unmistakable theoretical assertions about the simultaneity of race, gender and class oppression that predates multiracial feminist theorizing that emerged in the academy during the late twentieth century. This analysis examines the epistemological assumptions and theoretical assertions articulated in A Black Woman Speaks, exploring the ways in which the poem exemplifies an intercategorical, praxis-intersectionality approach and integrates group-centered, process-centered, and system-centered analytical varieties. The author argues that collectively remembering and reclaiming the genius of Beah Richards opens up an opportunity to reaffirm the radical political roots of an intersectionality approach, which often are forgotten in the depoliticized and commodified economic and cultural landscape of academia in the twenty-first century.

in the spring of 1945, they came armed not only with a commitment to democracy but also to Jim Crow practices. Race after Hitler tells the story of how troubled race relations among American occupation soldiers, and black-white mixing within Germany, unexpectedly shaped German notions of race after 1945. Biracial occupation children became objects of intense scrutiny and politicking by postwar Germans into the 1960s, resulting in a shift away from official antisemitism to a focus on color and blackness.\r\n\r\nBeginning with black GIs' unexpected feelings of liberation in postfascist Germany, Fehrenbach investigates reactions to their relations with white German women and to the few thousand babies born of these unions. Drawing on social welfare and other official reports, scientific studies, and media portrayals from both sides of the Atlantic, Fehrenbach reconstructs social policy debates regarding black occupation children, such as whether they should be integrated into German society or adopted to African American or other families abroad. Ultimately, a consciously liberal discourse of race emerged in response to the children among Germans who prided themselves on--and were lauded by the black American press for--rejecting the hateful practices of National Socialism and the segregationist United States.\r\n\r\nFehrenbach charts her story against a longer history of German racism extending from nineteenth-century colonialism through National Socialism to contemporary debates about multiculturalism. An important and provocative work, Race after Hitler explores how racial ideologies are altered through transnational contact accompanying war and regime change, even and especially in the most intimate areas of sex and reproduction.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30986596, "asset_id": 3058372, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3513785, "first_name": "Heide", "last_name": "Fehrenbach", "domain_name": "niu", "page_name": "HeideFehrenbach", "display_name": "Heide Fehrenbach", "profile_url": "https://niu.academia.edu/HeideFehrenbach?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3513785/4712895/16509203/s65_heide.fehrenbach.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1729, "name": "German History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11851, "name": "History of Childhood", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Childhood?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 8062678, "title": "Transcending Racism: A Methodology", "created_at": "2014-08-23T16:55:28.030-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8062678/Transcending_Racism_A_Methodology?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_8062678", "summary": "As humans, we are social beings having a sensory experience here on earth.

By examining the personal archival materials of Ma Seung, Frank Chan and Ernest Mark, and era\u2013specific Chinese political involvements and fieldwork, this article challenges previous simplistic understandings of the Chinese missionary experience that were based solely on the perspectives of mainstream Christian institutions and society. This article emphasizes the Chinese context and concepts such as the Dao, and affect (renqing, or human sentiments), that guided relationships in early Chinese Canada.  It aims to provide a more complicated understanding of why Chinese ministers chose to Christianize fellow Chinese, and why before 1950 many Chinese chose to be nominal Christians and only a small number converted.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34366903, "asset_id": 7744390, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 214928, "first_name": "Alison", "last_name": "Marshall", "domain_name": "brandonu", "page_name": "AlisonMarshall", "display_name": "Alison Marshall", "profile_url": "https://brandonu.academia.edu/AlisonMarshall?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/214928/49151/36503579/s65_alison.marshall.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 109, "name": "Christianity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christianity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2190, "name": "Chinese Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 8223, "name": "East Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Asian_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14893, "name": "Church History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Church_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 619396, "name": "Anthropology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Religion?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 6798499, "title": "Subtle Racism Viewing Race Through Hair", "created_at": "2014-04-18T07:31:13.292-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6798499/Subtle_Racism_Viewing_Race_Through_Hair?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_6798499", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33500168, "asset_id": 6798499, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1283141, "first_name": "Zoey", "last_name": "Rhodes", "domain_name": "warwick", "page_name": "ZoeyRhodes", "display_name": "Zoey Rhodes", "profile_url": "https://warwick.academia.edu/ZoeyRhodes?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1283141/3305610/3890024/s65_zoey.rhodes.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 83996, "name": "Hair", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hair?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 908463, "name": "Hair Care Market", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hair_Care_Market?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 6498873, "title": "REFLECTIVE JOURNAL Unit Name: Interpersonal Skills", "created_at": "2014-03-21T13:41:37.984-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6498873/REFLECTIVE_JOURNAL_Unit_Name_Interpersonal_Skills?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_6498873", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33278568, "asset_id": 6498873, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10352233, "first_name": "Vu", "last_name": "Anh", "domain_name": "vu", "page_name": "VuAnh", "display_name": "Vu Anh", "profile_url": "https://vu.academia.edu/VuAnh?f_ri=5453", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 294, "name": "Ethnic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 5654140, "title": "From colony to Special Administrative Region: ethnic minorities' participation in the making of legislation against racial discrimination in Hong Kong", "created_at": "2014-01-08T23:19:20.629-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5654140/From_colony_to_Special_Administrative_Region_ethnic_minorities_participation_in_the_making_of_legislation_against_racial_discrimination_in_Hong_Kong?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_5654140", "summary": "With the debate on legislating against racial discrimination, minority rights have started to come under attention.

Findings show that ethnic minorities in Hong Kong have been characterized with a low level of political participation, and the fighting for racial equality has been dominated by local advocacy groups. I argue that colonial rule has played a critical role in shaping ethnic minorities' political participation. Due to colonialism, race equality discussion had been suppressed under the colonial administration. The institutional structure of the colonial administration had further limited the possibility of ethnic minorities' involvement. Few social movements had been started by the ethnic minorities but they did not primarily focus on racial discrimination. with further changes in ethnic minority population after the handover, the lack of familiarity of the ethnic minorities towards the political system has continued to impede their participation in the racial discrimination legislation debate.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32730459, "asset_id": 5654140, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 793212, "first_name": "Raees", "last_name": "Baig", "domain_name": "hku-hk", "page_name": "RaeesBaig", "display_name": "Raees Baig", "profile_url": "https://hku-hk.academia.edu/RaeesBaig?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/793212/270303/509386/s65_raees.baig.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1118, "name": "Political Participation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Participation?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6942, "name": "Discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Discrimination?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 2525772, "title": "Del Cairo, Carlos y Esteban Rozo. 2006.

The arrival of European naturalists, American missionaries, and foreign merchants in the Hawaiian Islands is frequently attributed for triggering this diaspora.  However, little has been written about why Hawaiian immigrants themselves chose to migrate eastward across the Pacific or their reasons for permanent settlement in California.  Like the ali\u2019i on the Islands, Hawaiian commoners in the diaspora exercised agency in their accommodation and resistance to Pacific imperialism and colonialism as well.  Blending labor history, religious history, and anthropology, this thesis adopts an interdisciplinary and ethnohistorical approach that utilizes Hawaiian-language newspapers, American missionary letters, and oral histories from California\u2019s indigenous peoples.   I argue that precontact strategies were critical to preserving and holding onto an ethnic Hawaiian identity in encounters with merchants, missionaries, and indigenous peoples in California throughout the 1800s.

But in Europe, the denial of race\u2019s existence hinders research regarding structural explanations for minority educational inequality and often explains low educational attainment as a function of cultural differences. Examining classroom practices in a diverse Amsterdam primary school, this article documents racializing mechanisms that found minority students disproportionately disparaged, disciplined, and silenced. In addition, many were students under-recommended to higher level secondary school tracks. These findings reveal that Dutch schools are not racially meritocratic institutions and are relevant for scholars in the Netherlands and all other nations with educational institutions dominated by colorblind ideologies, white norms, and large immigrant populations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46855088, "asset_id": 26562504, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 165844, "first_name": "Melissa", "last_name": "Weiner", "domain_name": "holycross", "page_name": "MelissaWeiner", "display_name": "Melissa Weiner", "profile_url": "https://holycross.academia.edu/MelissaWeiner?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/165844/87537/7762134/s65_melissa.weiner.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 39525, "name": "Discipline", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Discipline?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 90027, "name": "Classroom Practices", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Classroom_Practices?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 169804, "name": "The Netherlands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Netherlands?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 408516, "name": "Race/Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_Ethnicity-1?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 8031278, "title": "Rap Lyrics on Trial", "created_at": "2014-08-20T06:25:04.863-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8031278/Rap_Lyrics_on_Trial?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_8031278", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34493264, "asset_id": 8031278, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 76989, "first_name": "Charis", "last_name": "Kubrin", "domain_name": "uci", "page_name": "CharisKubrin", "display_name": "Charis Kubrin", "profile_url": "https://uci.academia.edu/CharisKubrin?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/76989/297379/33251725/s65_charis.kubrin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 535, "name": "Criminal Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminal_Law-1?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14904, "name": "Hip-Hop/Rap", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hip-Hop_Rap?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 42830601, "title": "Power", "created_at": "2020-04-23T06:27:50.886-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42830601/Power?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_42830601", "summary": "This is Chapter 1 of the New Handbook of Political Sociology.

Second, we argue that this development rests upon the assumption that power under liberal democracy does not operate on exclusion, suppression, and violence. Thus, it becomes necessary to explain how and why we participate in our own subordination, especially the ways in which we internalize dominant discourses and then act against our own interests.  Finally, we challenge this assumption by drawing on theorists who emphasize the violent and exclusionary underpinnings of liberal democracy, especially Critical Race Theorists, post-colonial scholars, and theorists of elimination, death, exploitation, and disposability.

In a time of increased post-Brexit nationalism, BLM and heightened levels of racial exclusion in the media industries the grime music sector represents a space of contestation, where moving image technologies are deployed by young black creatives to claim urban space and disrupt the managerial processes of the post-industrial 'creative city'. In my analysis, these music video texts are not simply 'produced' out of a particular physical context but also operate to metonymically anchor their producers in the urban topography they inhabit. It is this imperative that has powered the growth of grime as a youth culture and fueled its creative disruption, as both a semi-autonomous cultural industries sector and as a set of transgressive symbolic practices.

However, little scholarship explores the overlapping consequences of racial change in congregations and neighborhoods over time. Since the number of all-white neighborhoods has fallen sharply in recent decades, we ask in this study: what are the consequences of racial change in congregations and neighborhoods on congregational attendance? We employ longitudinal data from over 20,000 United Methodist congregations between 1990 and 2010 paired with census tract data for the same time period. We use growth curve models to test three hypotheses derived from Organizational Ecology Theory. While Methodist churches have decreasing attendance, we find that racial diversity inside a church is associated with higher average attendance by year and across years. Outside a church, percent white in the neighborhood positively predicts attendance , at least in the short term. Both white and nonwhite Methodist churches have higher attendance when located in white neighborhoods; white churches in nonwhite neighborhoods fare the worst. Our conclusion discusses these patterns and highlights the complexities of accommodating racial differences in congregations amidst ongoing demographic changes outside their doors.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65456060, "asset_id": 44930290, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35074, "first_name": "Gerardo", "last_name": "Marti", "domain_name": "davidson", "page_name": "GerardoMarti", "display_name": "Gerardo Marti", "profile_url": "https://davidson.academia.edu/GerardoMarti?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/35074/11535/67837185/s65_gerardo.marti.jpeg"}, {"id": 30733333, "first_name": "Kevin", "last_name": "Dougherty", "domain_name": "baylor", "page_name": "KevinDougherty", "display_name": "Kevin D Dougherty", "profile_url": "https://baylor.academia.edu/KevinDougherty?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30733333/13211502/70916641/s65_kevin.dougherty.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 217, "name": "Sociology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Religion?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 310, "name": "Demography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Demography?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2613, "name": "Diversity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diversity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 9604, "name": "Equality and Diversity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Equality_and_Diversity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 11847, "name": "Quantitative Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Quantitative_Research?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 12620, "name": "Quantitative Methods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Quantitative_Methods?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 13886, "name": "Longitudinal Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Longitudinal_Research?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14893, "name": "Church History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Church_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 16742, "name": "Urban Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Sociology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 17802, "name": "Diversity & Inclusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diversity_and_Inclusion?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 31935, "name": "Neighborhood Effects", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neighborhood_Effects?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 87035, "name": "Organizations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organizations?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 99711, "name": "Church Growth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Church_Growth?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 157036, "name": "Urban Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Space?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 957019, "name": "Sociology of Ethnicity and Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Ethnicity_and_Race?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 44424708, "title": "Kant -

Understanding the swirl of hidden histories and memories in terms of race, community, and heritage radiates from social justice and the concept of social justice is expanded through discussion of a tradition rarely mentioned in heritage studies: tikkun ha-olam.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57792146, "asset_id": 37734320, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 86549729, "asset_id": 37734320, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3139420, "first_name": "Uzi", "last_name": "Baram", "domain_name": "ncf", "page_name": "UziBaram", "display_name": "Uzi Baram", "profile_url": "https://ncf.academia.edu/UziBaram?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3139420/1032026/1289988/s65_uzi.baram.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3210, "name": "Segregation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Segregation?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5792, "name": "Social Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Justice?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11452, "name": "Memory Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 42042, "name": "Nostalgia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nostalgia?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 70438, "name": "Florida history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Florida_history?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 34138119, "title": "Religious affiliation, ethnicity, and power in admission policies to Jewish religious schools", "created_at": "2017-08-05T01:58:26.611-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34138119/Religious_affiliation_ethnicity_and_power_in_admission_policies_to_Jewish_religious_schools?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_34138119", "summary": "This paper analyzes the challenges embedded in the conflict between the right to accessible education, which implies a prohibition on discriminatory practices in school admission, and the right to adaptable education, which accommodates children's cultural affiliations. It shows that a normative lens, which examines the ways by which legal rules correspond to conflicting rights and interests, cannot fully capture the tension between legal prohibitions on discrimination in education and the socio-cultural norms in religious communities. Thus, the paper offers a socio-legal lens, which focuses on the context of admission policies to Jewish religious schools. Based on three test cases of admission policies to Jewish religious schools in Israel, England, and Flanders, Belgium, the paper demonstrates how the legal rules regulating the admission policies are influenced by social forces. In Israel and England, these forces have facilitated a descent down slippery slope, originating with religious criteria, but concluding with discriminatory criteria. They also shaped admission practices reflecting the asymmetric power relations between the institutional school systems and individual families. The paper highlights the benefits of the Belgian policy, which proscribes religious classification of school candidates. This policy circumvents the ambiguous distinction between religion, ethnicity, and social class, and expands educational choices.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54063847, "asset_id": 34138119, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 412122, "first_name": "Lotem", "last_name": "Perry-Hazan", "domain_name": "haifa", "page_name": "LotemPerryHazan", "display_name": "Lotem Perry-Hazan", "profile_url": "https://haifa.academia.edu/LotemPerryHazan?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/412122/181027/14844706/s65_lotem.perry-hazan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6942, "name": "Discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Discrimination?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28574, "name": "Jewish Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jewish_Education?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1011760, "name": "Admission of Students", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Admission_of_Students?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 33568778, "title": "DIAGN\u00d3STICO SITUACIONAL 2017 , Bocacerrada, San Onofre, SUCRE", "created_at": "2017-06-20T05:31:28.214-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33568778/DIAGN%C3%93STICO_SITUACIONAL_2017_Bocacerrada_San_Onofre_SUCRE?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_33568778", "summary": "Bocacerrada, Sucre is a rural afrodescendant community in the Colombian Caribbean.

In the conclusion to the book, Kidd hints at the original point of departure for his research: he was driven by the \u201csuspicion . . . that the dethroning of biblical authority was a necessary prelude to the emergence of modern racism\u201d (271). The secular Enlightenment had opened the way to all sorts of horrors by intentionally or unintentionally\nundermining the \u201cmessage of universal brotherly love found in the New\nTestament\u201d (271). Yet in the course of his research, Kidd has to admit that the attractive simplicity of this hypothesis did not stand up to the pressure of the evidence. Rather than a quasi-Hegelian schema then, The Forging of Races offers a history of \u201cillogical developments\u201d (271). Kidd\u2019s analysis demonstrates how different strains of Protestant theology both obstructed and enabled racial thought. He takes very seriously\nthe antiracist implications of the Christian doctrine of monogenesis, that is, the insistence on the essential equality and community of mankind derived from the belief in the divine creation of mankind from a single origin. But he also notes that the ambiguities of biblical exegesis generated contradictory interpretations, which in turn served as a crucible for racial thought. He suggests that lingering questions about the narrative of Genesis raised the possibility of multiple acts of creation\u2014in short, the polygenesis of different races. These two opposing tendencies provide The Forging of Races with its fundamental drama and critical impetus.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51891905, "asset_id": 31553160, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 148029, "first_name": "Fredrik", "last_name": "Albritton Jonsson", "domain_name": "chicago", "page_name": "FredrikAlbrittonJonsson", "display_name": "Fredrik Albritton Jonsson", "profile_url": "https://chicago.academia.edu/FredrikAlbrittonJonsson?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/148029/39127/12393141/s65_fredrik.albritton_jonsson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7675, "name": "Scottish Enlightenment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Scottish_Enlightenment?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10106, "name": "Protestantism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Protestantism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 29139935, "title": "Seeing the destination AND the path: Using identity-based motivation to understand and reduce racial disparities in academic achievement (references)", "created_at": "2016-10-13T21:04:20.332-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29139935/Seeing_the_destination_AND_the_path_Using_identity_based_motivation_to_understand_and_reduce_racial_disparities_in_academic_achievement_references_?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_29139935", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49587065, "asset_id": 29139935, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33071015, "first_name": "Daphna", "last_name": "Oyserman", "domain_name": "usc", "page_name": "DaphnaOyserman", "display_name": "Daphna Oyserman", "profile_url": "https://usc.academia.edu/DaphnaOyserman?f_ri=5453", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 50692930, "first_name": "Neil", "last_name": "Lewis", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "NeilLewis1", "display_name": "Neil Lewis", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/NeilLewis1?f_ri=5453", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 972, "name": "Self and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_and_Identity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26879, "name": "Social Class", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Class?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45909, "name": "Self-regulation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self-regulation?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 123474, "name": "Academics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Academics?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 489519, "name": "Identity Based Motivation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Based_Motivation?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1171147, "name": "Racial and Ethnic Disparities In Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_and_Ethnic_Disparities_In_Education?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 26655956, "title": "Restoring the Political: Thoughts on the Contribution of Adolph Reed Jr", "created_at": "2016-07-01T09:48:26.023-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26655956/Restoring_the_Political_Thoughts_on_the_Contribution_of_Adolph_Reed_Jr?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_26655956", "summary": "This article focuses on the key contributions made by Adolph Reed Jr., focusing on his efforts to \" restore the political \" to analysis of urban politics and race.

Vi framh\u00e5ller s\u00e4rskilt distinktionen mellan formella och substantiella r\u00e4ttigheter som central f\u00f6r f\u00f6rst\u00e5elsen av det samtida medborgarskapet. Vi uppm\u00e4rksammar s\u00e4rskilt betydelsen av etnicitet och migration, inte minst genom att synligg\u00f6ra r\u00e5dande medborgar(skaps)ideal, formade utifr\u00e5n f\u00f6rest\u00e4llningar om (o)likhet p\u00e5 grundval av etnicitet, kultur, nation och \u201dras\u201d.

This book investigates the afterlife of \"race\" since 1945 and challenges the long-dominant assumption among historians that it disappeared from public discourse and policy-making with the defeat of the Third Reich and its genocidal European empire. Drawing on case studies of Afro-Germans, Jews, and Turks---arguably the three most important minority communities in postwar Germany---the authors detail continuities and change across the 1945 divide and offer the beginnings of a history of race and racialization after Hitler. A final chapter moves beyond the German context to consider the postwar engagement with \"race\" in France, Britain, Sweden, and the Netherlands, where waves of postwar, postcolonial, and labor migration troubled nativist notions of national and European identity.\r\n\r\nAfter the Nazi Racial State poses interpretative questions for the historical understanding of postwar societies and democratic transformation, both in Germany and throughout Europe. It elucidates key analytical categories, historicizes current discourse, and demonstrates how contemporary debates about immigration and integration---and about just how much \"difference\" a democracy can accommodate---are implicated in a longer history of \"race.\" This book explores why the concept of \"race\" became taboo as a tool for understanding German society after 1945. Most crucially, it suggests the social and epistemic consequences of this determined retreat from \"race\" for Germany and Europe as a whole.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30986512, "asset_id": 3058391, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 30986513, "asset_id": 3058391, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 30986511, "asset_id": 3058391, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37776558, "first_name": "Rita", "last_name": "Chin", "domain_name": "umich", "page_name": "RitaChin", "display_name": "Rita Chin", "profile_url": "https://umich.academia.edu/RitaChin?f_ri=5453", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 3513785, "first_name": "Heide", "last_name": "Fehrenbach", "domain_name": "niu", "page_name": "HeideFehrenbach", "display_name": "Heide Fehrenbach", "profile_url": "https://niu.academia.edu/HeideFehrenbach?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3513785/4712895/16509203/s65_heide.fehrenbach.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1729, "name": "German History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 75385297, "title": "Kicking It Out?

Whilst fans recognize the importance of raising awareness of racial discrimination, nearly three quarters of White fans do not engage with any Kick It Out initiatives. In the face of new challenges, including the largely unregulated space of social media, and a socio-political climate that has facilitated the resurgence of overtly expressed bigoted, colour and cultural-based racisms, the article stresses that the English football authorities must support the work of anti-racism organizations to increase their potency amongst White fans if racial

For selection of the respondents from both religious groups, purposive sampling technique was utilized. The gathered data in the study was looked into with respect to the social identity theory. The results of the study suggested that socio-cognitive processes of social categorization, social identification and social comparison in the individuals resulted in discriminatory patterns in the inter-group relations among the Shiite and Sunni religious schools of thought.

ARI PALOS) IS A DOCUMENTARY FILM that follows the debate in Arizona over ethnic studies (ETHS). In particular, it chronicles the last few years of Mexican American studies/Raza studies (MAS) at Tucson High School, including the social and political climate surrounding House Bill 2281-the bill that eventually dismantled ETHS. The film weaves together elements\u2014contemporary and historic-to contextualize the debate over ethnic studies and to elicit support for the campaign to retain the programs in the district. Through interviews and footage of classroom dynamics, the documentary shows how that the program has transformed students' personal and educational experiences. For instance, Precious Knowledge notes that, although the dropout rate among Latina/o is close to 50 per cent nationwide, the graduation rate for students enrolled in MAS is 93 per cent. The film situates its narrative in the context of a longer history of ongoing assaults against immigration and the persistence of racial conflict between the school system and students of color. Despite its broader political intentions and rhetorical strategies, the film leaves itself open to questions regarding how ethnic studies programs and their supporters can analyze racism, anti-immigrant policies and practices from a critical race and feminist framework. While the documentary highlights the racial tenets that undergird anti-Latino/a and anti-immigrant efforts including HB 2281, its narrative neglects the constitutive relationship that gender and sexism have to race, racism, the state, and its institutions. At the same time, disarticulating race from gender obscures the role that gender and sexism have had throughout the campaigns to both dismantle and defend ETHS/MAS. Further, the film also raises concerns about how to effectively address an important paradox. While it is meant to build support for ethnic studies programs that serve marginalized students, the documentary's attempt to disprove conservative accusations that ETHS/MAS teaches anti-American revolutionary ideologies unwittingly reifies the state and its institutions as legitimate guarantors of recognition. This undermines a critical component of ethnic studies programs, which is to teach students how to challenge the state, its institutions and ideologies. Precious Knowledge links the development of ETHS/MAS to the long history of racial discrimination and exclusion in Arizona. Featuring archived photos and interviews, the film shows images of Chicana/o students from the 1960's leading and participating in student protests P", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44045806, "asset_id": 23634668, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34477203, "first_name": "Connie", "last_name": "Wun, Ph.D.", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ConnieWun", "display_name": "Connie Wun, Ph.D.", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ConnieWun?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/34477203/12112073/34567811/s65_connie.wun.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 904804, "name": "Critical Ethnic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Ethnic_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 15270058, "title": "Rosino - SOCI1501W Race, Class, and Gender Syllabus (UCONN) Fall 2015", "created_at": "2015-08-29T11:29:25.791-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15270058/Rosino_SOCI1501W_Race_Class_and_Gender_Syllabus_UCONN_Fall_2015?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_15270058", "summary": "This is the syllabus for my Race, Class, and Gender (Writing Intesnsive) course at UConn.

With both US-based and transnational cases, this book presents an empirical grounding for understanding how race and sexuality are mutually constitutive categories. \n\nProviding a comprehensive overview of racialized sexualities, Race and Sexuality is an essential text for any advanced course on race, sexuality, and intersectionality.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56808708, "asset_id": 34570106, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1999979, "first_name": "Salvador", "last_name": "Vidal-Ortiz", "domain_name": "american", "page_name": "SalvadorVidalOrtiz", "display_name": "Salvador  Vidal-Ortiz", "profile_url": "https://american.academia.edu/SalvadorVidalOrtiz?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1999979/661412/1090735/s65_salvador.vidal-ortiz.jpg"}, {"id": 4058617, "first_name": "Brandon", "last_name": "Robinson", "domain_name": "ucriverside", "page_name": "BrandonRobinson", "display_name": "Brandon A Robinson", "profile_url": "https://ucriverside.academia.edu/BrandonRobinson?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4058617/1553954/37270993/s65_brandon.robinson.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 699, "name": "Queer Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2432, "name": "Critical Race Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3114, "name": "Queer Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4714, "name": "Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexuality?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 7894, "name": "Intersectionality Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality_Theory?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14998, "name": "Gender and Sexuality Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 21003, "name": "Sexuality And Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexuality_And_Culture?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 24294, "name": "Gender and Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Race?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 26743, "name": "Intersectionality and Social Inequality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality_and_Social_Inequality?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 34327, "name": "Intersectionality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 36438, "name": "Sex and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sex_and_Sexuality?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 36439, "name": "Sexuality Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexuality_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 41634, "name": "Queer of Color Critique", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_of_Color_Critique?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 78837, "name": "Queer", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 600224, "name": "Racialized Sexualities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racialized_Sexualities?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 968724, "name": "Black Queer Studies and Queer of Color Critique", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Queer_Studies_and_Queer_of_Color_Critique?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 41269384, "title": "'Ordinary Girls' Is the Diasporican Memoir I Have Been Waiting For", "created_at": "2019-12-11T12:10:43.342-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41269384/Ordinary_Girls_Is_the_Diasporican_Memoir_I_Have_Been_Waiting_For?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_41269384", "summary": "Link to review: https://www.latinorebels.com/2019/12/11/ordinarygirlsreview/\n\n\u201cI come from poverty, from El Caser\u00edo Padre Rivera\u2026 It was a world of men, of violence, a place too often not safe for women and girls,\u201d Jaquira D\u00edaz writes in the introduction of her memoir Ordinary Girls.

Meanwhile, common narratives around growing up often articulate development through heteronormative milestones while devaluing queerness as weird, immature, and childish. What if any role does or should US ethnic literary studies and scholars of literature play in addressing how queer youth survive in this world? This essay formulates the minor minor as a positionality that apprehends the queer-of-color youth and proliferates spaces for their flourishing within our scholarly practices. It calls for enacting a childish methodology that is playfully precocious and na\u00efve toward orthodox critical approaches, remaining willfully undisciplined and undisciplinary.\n\nEng follows the lead of Kiran Sharma, fearless protagonist of Rakesh Satyal\u2019s novel Blue Boy (2009), to conceptualize the queer-of-color youth as a disruptive minoritarian figure that cultivates possibilities for queerness within and against normative demands of growing up. Relaying his experiences of bullying and shaming, Kiran observes how the \u201cAmerican\u201d and \u201cIndian\u201d worlds that he navigates as a preadolescent come together through what they hold in common, which requires the disciplining of his queer desires as signaling a deformity that threatens their socialities. Imagining himself as the reincarnation of Krishna, Kiran engages in modes of disidentification, fantasy, and play to recast his wayward desires as delectable modes of uncommon beauty that transform his deformity into divinity.

We focus on a recent struggle in Barcelona, Spain, to highlight the unresolved tensions and multi-layered silences amongst groups who share the objective of revisiting their city space and its racial/colonial history.  While city officials and mainstream anti-racist activists make appeals to universal human rights, communities of color emphasize continuities of racial/colonial injustice and contemporary implications. Erasure of colonial violence through memorialization is made visible by acknowledging the necessity for renaming. Yet we argue a second type of erasure occurs in the process of re-naming, where resistance by communities of color is equally neglected. Consequently, what is presented as progressive anti-racist responses and engaged commitment to diversity and tolerance rests on notions of a deferred politics of aspiration rather than a politics of action.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55074635, "asset_id": 30468343, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6628864, "first_name": "Roberto D.", "last_name": "Hern\u00e1ndez", "domain_name": "sdsu", "page_name": "RobertoDHern\u00e1ndez", "display_name": "Roberto D.

The onset of \"race\" as legitimate taxonomy for human variation below the species level amongst genetically distinct groups capable of crossbreeding is located precisely at the point of Cro Magnon's emergence-a phylogenetic process involving an enzyme that is critical in the sequence of chemical reactions that produce or catalyze melanin which until said emergence had been present in all humanity from Afarensis (dubbed \"Lucy\") through African \"Eve\" (so-called) and all of her successors, except it is missing in white humans descending from Cro Magnon.

Ania Loomba has suggested that \"more than any other play of the time, Othello allows us to see that skin colour, religion, and location were often contradictorily yoked together within ideologies of 'race,' and that all these attributes were animated by notions of sexual and gender difference.\" While some critics would moderate that view\u2014pointing more or less toward religion, or gender, or geography\u2014few would disagree about the basic ideology of race that Loomba identifies in the play and the early modern period. Daniel J. Vitkus, for example, focuses more on religious conversion than race, but still argues that \"cultural anxieties about 'turning Turk'\" were part of \"the fear of a black planet that gripped Europeans in the early modern era as they faced the expansion of Ottoman power.\" Many others have agreed that the play \"repeats and reinforces the already established perception of Turks as the 'religious threat' and racial 'other.'\" A few, like Eric Griffin, have brought the focus on religion closer to home, reading the play as an expression of English nationalism during a time of tension with Catholic Spain, when anti-Catholic, anti-Spanish expression was its own form of othering \"ethnocentric discourse.\" But even this broadened critical discussion is based on examination of a limited number of the texts published in early modern England, and it tells only a small part of the story of race in Othello. Digital approaches, however, open up a vast new body of texts for analysis, shifting the ground on which such criticism can take place.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58523133, "asset_id": 36229717, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31207690, "first_name": "James Jaehoon", "last_name": "Lee", "domain_name": "uc", "page_name": "JamesLee", "display_name": "James Jaehoon Lee", "profile_url": "https://uc.academia.edu/JamesLee?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31207690/14350159/19268434/s65_james.lee.jpg"}, {"id": 36365237, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Eichmann", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DavidEichmann", "display_name": "David Eichmann", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DavidEichmann?f_ri=5453", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1197, "name": "Digital Humanities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Humanities?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2008, "name": "Machine Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Machine_Learning?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3146, "name": "Shakespeare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shakespeare?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22585, "name": "English Renaissance Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Renaissance_Literature?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 47980, "name": "Data Visualization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_Visualization?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 57262, "name": "Digital scholarship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_scholarship?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 459269, "name": "Data mining and Text mining", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_mining_and_Text_mining?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 35865615, "title": "H\u00e5rda tag \u2013 mot oj\u00e4mlikheten!

Secondly, it suggests that immigrant youth, particularly those living in smaller U.S. cities, regularly cross, reinforce, and blur social boundaries among a range of social groups in a process better described as hybrid assimilation, which often causes feelings of identity confusion as well as opportunities for daily navigating, contesting, and adding new meaning to an African American identity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52994967, "asset_id": 32848171, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35144213, "first_name": "Shelly", "last_name": "Habecker", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ShellyHabecker", "display_name": "Shelly Habecker", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ShellyHabecker?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/35144213/10216330/11400851/s65_shelly.habecker.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3870, "name": "African Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46039, "name": "Youth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 28916551, "title": "Between Mold and Molt: Aesthetics and the Matter of Race", "created_at": "2016-10-04T10:57:21.507-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28916551/Between_Mold_and_Molt_Aesthetics_and_the_Matter_of_Race?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_28916551", "summary": "Written in 2014, my senior thesis explores permutations in visions of skin and embodiment within works by U.S.-based women of color (Theresa Cha, Toni Morrison, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles).

But what happens when Japanese Americans, born and raised in the United States, are the ones living abroad in Japan? \r\n \r\nRedefining Japaneseness chronicles how Japanese American migrants to Japan navigate and complicate the categories of Japanese and \u201cforeigner.\u201d Drawing from extensive interviews and fieldwork in the Tokyo area, Jane H. Yamashiro tracks the multiple ways these migrants strategically negotiate and interpret their daily interactions. Following a diverse group of subjects\u2014some of only Japanese ancestry and others of mixed heritage, some fluent in Japanese and others struggling with the language, some from Hawaii and others from the US continent\u2014her study reveals wide variations in how Japanese Americans perceive both Japaneseness and Americanness. \r\n \r\nMaking an important contribution to both Asian American studies and scholarship on transnational migration, Redefining Japaneseness critically interrogates the common assumption that people of Japanese ancestry identify as members of a global diaspora. Furthermore, through its close examination of subjects who migrate from one highly-industrialized nation to another, it dramatically expands our picture of the migrant experience.\r\n\r\nCheck out the website https://redefiningjapaneseness.com \r\nLike the book on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/redefiningjapaneseness/\r\nWatch a short interview https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0u43MQWZAg\r\nSee a book talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGC3D9M6GUk&feature=youtu.be", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46144987, "asset_id": 25785994, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28262, "first_name": "Jane H.", "last_name": "Yamashiro", "domain_name": "mills", "page_name": "JaneHYamashiro", "display_name": "Jane H.

There is a long legacy of picture books that teach young African American boys to become \u201clittle men,\u201d leaving behind childish ways to demonstrate rigid maturity and asexual masculinity. This project ultimately contends that many African American picture books not only respond to generations of hate crimes and discrimination but also that black authors and illustrators use the genre as a way to protect the youngest generation and seek social justice. By analyzing the African American picture book genre, which has gone simultaneously critically ignored and popularly embraced, one can see a long lineage of this theme.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 41639458, "asset_id": 18616542, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 210414, "first_name": "Cara", "last_name": "Byrne", "domain_name": "case", "page_name": "CaraByrne", "display_name": "Cara Byrne", "profile_url": "https://case.academia.edu/CaraByrne?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/210414/1020393/58617860/s65_cara.byrne.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3919, "name": "Visual Rhetoric", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Rhetoric?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4255, "name": "Children's and Young Adult Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Childrens_and_Young_Adult_Literature?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14912, "name": "African American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_American_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 10280452, "title": "Nuevo Chicago?: Language, Diaspora, and Latina/o Panethnic Formations", "created_at": "2015-01-22T05:39:20.442-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10280452/Nuevo_Chicago_Language_Diaspora_and_Latina_o_Panethnic_Formations?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_10280452", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50888506, "asset_id": 10280452, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 737716, "first_name": "Jonathan", "last_name": "Rosa", "domain_name": "stanford", "page_name": "JonathanRosa", "display_name": "Jonathan Rosa", "profile_url": "https://stanford.academia.edu/JonathanRosa?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/737716/6850454/98466621/s65_jonathan.rosa.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2524, "name": "Sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2718, "name": "Linguistic Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Anthropology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2940, "name": "Latina/o Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latina_o_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 36467, "name": "Language Ideologies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Ideologies?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 8504459, "title": "Should We Conserve the Notion of Race?", "created_at": "2014-09-26T00:38:45.474-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8504459/Should_We_Conserve_the_Notion_of_Race?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_8504459", "summary": "in Pragmatism and the Problem of Race, ed.

It chronicles the beginning of Bethune's NCNW.  Readers gain a sense of her organizing principles, why she felt it was necessary to \"pool\" Black feminine political energy at this time, in the mid 1930s.  You will also get a sense of the friction she encountered from other Black activist women--an aspect of her political career that has not been properly examined.  In my narrative, archival/primary source research takes precedence.  Pulling particularly from newspapers of that era lend a more complete picture of the dynamics between these particular Black women activists.\r\n\r\n\r\n***Near Future Plans for this Chapter***:\r\nI am in the process of redeveloping this chapter to self-publish as part of a three-book series, \"A Passion For Social Equality,\" covering Bethune's political activism during the 1930s and 1940s.

Focus is on the question of how a musical space in which various actors intonate their visions of transcultural unity and difference, can be analysed ethnographically. In order to do so, the paper gives an ethnographic account of such a space and how it is created in a particular version of a well-known song, Bob Marley\u2019s 'Redemption Song' played by the R\u00e9unionese band Bast\u00e8r.\r\n\r\nMy central argument is that World Music(ians) mediate(s) local images of authenticity for global audiences. On R\u00e9union Island, an Overseas-Department of France in the Indian Ocean, this process becomes strikingly apparent. Before its colonisation the island was uninhabited. As such, traditions here cannot be termed original or rooted, but are indicators of cultural transition and 'routedness'.\r\n\r\nI argue that R\u00e9unionese musicians use traditions to (re)territorialise themselves within a larger translocal soundscape, a World Music scene in which R\u00e9union Island for them becomes only one of many points of reference. As such, the specific musical mediation of Bast\u00e8r offers a different perspective on what a World Music that incorporates both unity and difference might sound like.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 2702898, "asset_id": 380410, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 289900, "first_name": "Carsten", "last_name": "Wergin", "domain_name": "uni-heidelberg", "page_name": "wergin", "display_name": "Carsten Wergin", "profile_url": "https://uni-heidelberg.academia.edu/wergin?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/289900/59778/36035978/s65_carsten.wergin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 27, "name": "Entrepreneurship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Entrepreneurship?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 671, "name": "Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 928, "name": "Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 934, "name": "Media and Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1760, "name": "Media Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Anthropology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 16088, "name": "Creolization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creolization?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 17015, "name": "European/EU Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/European_EU_Politics?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 25275, "name": "Indian Ocean World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_World?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 28061, "name": "World music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_music?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 36236722, "title": "BOOK REVIEW A race against time: Psychology and challenges to deracialisation in South Africa", "created_at": "2018-03-23T05:16:02.651-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36236722/BOOK_REVIEW_A_race_against_time_Psychology_and_challenges_to_deracialisation_in_South_Africa?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_36236722", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56140648, "asset_id": 36236722, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 79221037, "first_name": "Mogobe", "last_name": "Ramose", "domain_name": "unisouthafr", "page_name": "MogobeRamose", "display_name": "Mogobe Ramose", "profile_url": "https://unisouthafr.academia.edu/MogobeRamose?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/79221037/19353494/19273248/s65_mogobe.ramose.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 40147943, "title": "Looking Like the Enemy: The WWII Japanese American Experience", "created_at": "2019-08-22T08:54:11.065-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40147943/Looking_Like_the_Enemy_The_WWII_Japanese_American_Experience?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_40147943", "summary": "Co-curated event, \"A Pilgrimage to WWII Japanese-American Internment Camps.\" An exhibit at the Hartnett Gallery, University of Rochester, Nov. 17 -  Dec.11, 2017, with photographs by Margaret Miyake, commentary by Notch Miyake, and historical ephemera from the Re-Envisioning Japan Collection (J.

The Klan's self-proclaimed mission to uphold white Protestant hegemony in America resulted not only in the identification of imagined racial and cultural threats. As important were mythical interpretations of history, according to which the white race was believed to be destined by God to thrive on American soil.

Asian patriarchy. Model minority children. Generation gap. The many images used to describe the prototypical Asian family have given rise to two versions of the Asian immigrant family myth. The first celebrates Asian families for upholding the traditional heteronormative ideal of the \u201cnormal (white) American family\u201d based on a hard-working male breadwinner and a devoted wife and mother who raises obedient children. The other demonizes Asian families around these very same cultural values by highlighting the dangers of excessive parenting, oppressive hierarchies, and emotionless pragmatism in Asian cultures.\n \nSaving Face cuts through these myths, offering a more nuanced portrait of Asian immigrant families in a changing world as recalled by the people who lived them first-hand: the grown children of Chinese and Korean immigrants. Drawing on extensive interviews, sociologist Angie Y. Chung examines how these second-generation children negotiate the complex and conflicted feelings they have toward their family responsibilities and upbringing. Although they know little about their parents\u2019 lives, she reveals how Korean and Chinese Americans assemble fragments of their childhood memories, kinship narratives, and racial myths to make sense of their family experiences. However, Chung also finds that these adaptive strategies come at a considerable social and psychological cost and do less to reconcile the social stresses that minority immigrant families endure today.\n \nSaving Face not only gives readers a new appreciation for the often painful generation gap between immigrants and their children, it also reveals the love, empathy, and communication strategies families use to help bridge those rifts.

concept of death can provide a new perspective on the question of why prominent sections of the Australian political and media establishment have resisted recognising the Stolen Generations as a genocide. This paper examines the role of death understood as definitional in genocide, and finality as the defining aspect of \u2018death\u2019 employed in this way. Genocide, in the popular imagination, is based on the Holocaust as paradigmatic case and invokes death as central symbol. Since mass death as a consequence of the state's actions toward its civilian subjects is posited as illegitimate, the legitimacy of a state which has committed genocide is in question. In the context of Australia's 'history wars,' the arguments of denialists are premised upon the position that if death did not occur then genocide did not occur, and if genocide did not occur, then the state is legitimate and national identity is secure.

The research illustrates how cultural patterns become internalized at early stages of growth, and how these patterns are translated into dominant masculinities and submissive femininities. The designed methodology involved working closely with the Indigenous communities' children, their families and teachers as well as school officials in order to map the multiple voices representing the problem. In addition, the analysis identified the challenges faced by the institutions that work towards reducing and eliminating violence against children, specifically looking at gender-based\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nThe book makes visible how violence against boys, girls and women is further enabled in contexts of economic and social disparity and goes hand-in-hand with stratification based on class, gender, ethnicity, and race.

Erstens\r\nbesteht ein Risiko, dass die alevitische Minderheit in dem von Sunniten dominierten Einwanderermilieu als\r\nGruppe mit niedrigerem Prestige und somit die alevitische Herkunft als Stigma wahrgenommen wird. Zweitens ist die Unterscheidung von Sunniten und Aleviten im t\u00fcrkischen Migrantenmilieu ein Tabuthema. Viele Aleviten in Deutschland thematisieren ihre alevitische Herkunft nicht, um einer m\u00f6glichen\r\nDiskreditierung aus dem Weg zu gehen, und politisch korrekte Sunniten sind moralisch dazu verpflichtet, sich in Diskretion zu \u00fcben.

In 2002, the Japanese dancer Junko Kudo became the first non-Jamaican to win Jamaica\u2019s National Dancehall Queen Contest. High-profile victories such as these affirmed and invigorated Japan\u2019s enthusiasm for dancehall reggae. In Babylon East , the anthropologist Marvin D. Sterling traces the history of the Japanese embrace of dancehall reggae and other elements of Jamaican culture, including Rastafari, roots reggae, and dub music.

Eds. Farish A. Noor and Peter Carey. Amsterdam: AUP, 15 January 2021.\n\nThe colonisation of Southeast Asia was a long and often violent process where numerous military campaigns were waged by the colonial powers across the region. The notion of racial difference was crucial in many of\nthese wars, as native Southeast Asian societies were often framed in negative terms as 'savage' and 'backward' communities that needed to be subdued and 'civilised'. This collection of critical essays focuses on the colonial construction of race and looks at how the colonial wars in 19th-century Southeast Asia were rationalised via recourse to theories of racial difference, making race a significant factor in the wars of Empire. Looking at the colonial wars in Java, Borneo, Siam, the Philippines, the Malay Peninsula and other parts of Southeast Asia, the essays examine the manner in which the idea of racial difference was weaponised by the colonising powers and how forms of local resistance often worked through such colonial structures of identity politics.\n\nThere is a 20 percent discount on this book until 20 March 2021 -:  \u201cPub_RacialDifferenceColonialWars\u201d.

In the post-apartheid period, the ruling ANC framed its democratisation project as remedial , a corrective to centuries of dispossession. This entailed government providing the physical infrastructure required for black South Africans to return to cities, not as precarious squatters on the urban fringe, but as residents with an equal right to the city. Yet, more than a quarter century later, little progress has been made in any substantive sense. While South Africa has delivered more free, formal housing units than any other modern democracy, it has consistently failed to coordinate this programme with employment, transportation, and food security initiatives. This has left residents with homes to be sure, but typically delivered to locations where residents already live, rendering the geography of apartheid permanent. This chapter also accounts for the substandard quality of the units delivered; the slow pace of delivery ; and the fact that the housing backlog continues to grow despite the ongoing provision of homes. It concludes with an analysis of the exclusionary effects of the government's equation of housing delivery with democratisation tout court.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64908745, "asset_id": 44478350, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 164868, "first_name": "Zachary", "last_name": "Levenson", "domain_name": "uncg", "page_name": "ZacharyLevenson", "display_name": "Zachary Levenson", "profile_url": "https://uncg.academia.edu/ZacharyLevenson?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/164868/41844/80251981/s65_zachary.levenson.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 977, "name": "Development Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2727, "name": "Welfare State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Welfare_State?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5040, "name": "South African Politics and Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_African_Politics_and_Society?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5091, "name": "Democratization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democratization?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6191, "name": "Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_in_Sub-Saharan_Africa?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 9521, "name": "Housing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Housing?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 16742, "name": "Urban Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Sociology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 42627, "name": "Sub-Saharan Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sub-Saharan_Africa?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 54259, "name": "Cities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cities?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 61866, "name": "South Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Africa?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 77281, "name": "Decolonization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonization?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 123082, "name": "Post-Apartheid", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Apartheid?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 135914, "name": "Evictions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Evictions?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 544849, "name": "African National Congress", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_National_Congress?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1595644, "name": "Housing Delivery and Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Housing_Delivery_and_Management?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 43170229, "title": "\u201cOverloaded like a Bolivian Truck\u201d Discursive constructions of gender, race, and nationalism in northern Chilean memes", "created_at": "2020-05-26T11:01:39.615-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43170229/_Overloaded_like_a_Bolivian_Truck_Discursive_constructions_of_gender_race_and_nationalism_in_northern_Chilean_memes?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_43170229", "summary": "Memes have become an important linguistic tool not only for communicating emotions and ideas, but also are integral to constructing the self in online space.

The fear of the \u203ayellow peril\u2039 found expression in science and politics as well as in innumerable invasion novels which depicted the swamping of the European outpost in the Pacific by Asiatic hordes. The programme of a white society was reasoned scientifically and found political supporters not least in the labour movement. Moreover, it found expression in a medium which was even more popular than pulp fiction: consumer racism which propagated the consumption of \u203awhite sugar\u2039. \u203aWhite sugar\u2039 was a very special commodity: refined white and produced white, it comprised white labourers, dearer sweetness, protection from the world market, and gaining of intra-continental acceptance through subsidies. Certainly there were countless points of contact between colour discrimination and thinking in terms of whiteness. In the context of the European diggers\u2019 rebellions on the goldfields, the workers\u2019 strikes against the replacement of white with Chinese labour and clashes with Aborigines on the colonial frontier, the whites\u2019 anger was given vent to. But these were largely isolated incidents involving concrete problems and select societal groups. Invasion novels and sugar consumption, on the other hand, aimed at the whole society. The problem to turn the empty north, considered \u203aterra nullius\u2039, into a breeding ground for whiteness and, thus, into a bulwark against the \u203ayellow peril\u2039 was considered problematic, however. This was due to the utilization interest of the agrarian capital as well as the phantasies of degeneration of race sciences.

For its critics, it is a depraved and ruthless physical and commercial exploitation of mostly poor young men. This Companion offers engaging and informative essays about the social impact and historical importance of the sport of boxing. It includes a comprehensive chronology of the sport, listing all the important events and personalities. Essays examine topics such as women in boxing, boxing and the rise of television, boxing in Africa, boxing and literature, and boxing and Hollywood films.

In this article, I am not defending or making any arguments for the charges levied against Professor Ramadan-they are serious and require full and fair examination by the authorities and the courts as well as more responsible coverage from the media. The cause of sexual harassment is rightly receiving a much needed and overdue global attention. What is important is to make sure that the scales of justice in pursuit of a needed legal, social and political corrective does not lead to undermining the rights and standing of a similarly demonized community. Demanding justice, fairness and transparency is a universally supported set of principles, which are critical in the case of Professor Ramadan. The guilt or innocence after a transparent legal process and a trial are what all parties to this painful case deserve and expect. Muslim subjects have become accustomed to an abnormal legal treatment from the moment they are arrested and charged, and even throughout the court proceedings. This abnormal is becoming the normal no matter whether the charges are civil or criminal and is for sure the case when the charges are remotely related to terrorism. I do think that the initial attempts to defend Professor Ramadan were wrong in disparaging the women who levied the charges. These shortsighted attacks on the women who came forth caused a mix-up and confusion between the demands on the French legal system to treat Professor Ramadan fairly and the attempts to win public debates and alter the demonized media coverage of the Muslim subject. These two should be separated and I am not sure how this should be done but it should be part of any serious approach. A basic analysis of the French media coverage of this case points to the problematic nature of the coverage and the preponderance of journalists to pile-on and sentence Professor Ramadan before even the end of the investigation and the court proceedings have started. What is expected of the French State and its legal system is to adhere to the due process of the law and accord Professor Ramadan the same rights that are granted to any non-Muslim, non-Arab and non-Maghrabi person in the country. Indeed, the legal process in France is tainted by the differentiated treatment accorded to all \" non-French to the source \" populations that face systemic discrimination at all levels of society including foremost in the legal system. The treatment is similar to the one faced by the African Americans in the U.S. and an entrenched racism dating from the colonial period is ever present in France. Let's be clear \u2013 Professor Ramadan travelled willingly to France and surrendered to the police authorities in order to face the charges levied against him and then to prepare for the legal proceedings. The French authorities moved to arrest Professor Ramadan, refused to grant bail, placed him in solitary confinement, and limited family visitation and access to proper medical care, which collectively point to the differentiated treatment reserved for the Arab and Muslim", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56344721, "asset_id": 36431135, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

society that is racially and economically divided. In fact, the U.S ranks at the bottom when it comes to comparative data on poverty, employment, income and wealth inequality, education, health inequality, and residential segregation. The inequalities of today were centuries in the making \u2013 resulting from government policy, housing industry practices, individual acts of discrimination, and local zoning and land use barriers. Current policies and practices reinforce and perpetuate segregation and inequality. We simply cannot prosper as a nation with this level of inequality and division. Housing lies at the very center of this phenomenon. What we do about access to housing opportunity and the dismantling of segregation affects the entire fabric of our nation. The achievement of fair housing and dismantling of segregation are essential to creating access to opportunity for everyone. In this 2017 Fair Housing Trends Report, we make The Case for Fair Housing.\n\nFounded in 1988 and headquartered in Washington, DC, the National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA) is the only national organization dedicated solely to ending discrimination in housing. NFHA is the voice of fair housing and works to eliminate housing discrimination and to ensure equal housing opportunity for all people through leadership, education and outreach, membership services, public policy initiatives, community development initiatives, advocacy, and enforcement. NFHA is a consortium of more than 220 private, nonprofit fair housing organizations, state and local civil rights agencies, and individuals from throughout the United States. NFHA recognizes the importance of home as a component of the American Dream and aids in the creation of diverse, barrier-free communities throughout the nation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52746407, "asset_id": 32567655, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 63297761, "first_name": "National Fair Housing", "last_name": "Alliance", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "NationalFairHousingAlliance", "display_name": "National Fair Housing Alliance", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/NationalFairHousingAlliance?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/63297761/16427914/16791514/s65_national_fair_housing.alliance.jpg"}, {"id": 63307083, "first_name": "Shanti", "last_name": "Abedin", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ShantiAbedin", "display_name": "Shanti Abedin", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ShantiAbedin?f_ri=5453", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 63308495, "first_name": "Morgan", "last_name": "Williams", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MorganWilliams35", "display_name": "Morgan Williams", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MorganWilliams35?f_ri=5453", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2260, "name": "Disability Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disability_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2789, "name": "Government", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Government?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3210, "name": "Segregation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Segregation?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 7562, "name": "Civil Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Civil_Rights?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 9252, "name": "Housing Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Housing_Policy?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 9521, "name": "Housing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Housing?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 17157, "name": "Affordable Housing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affordable_Housing?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 20008, "name": "Housing Economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Housing_Economics?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 21507, "name": "Homelessness And Housing Exclusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homelessness_And_Housing_Exclusion?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 25963, "name": "Housing Policies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Housing_Policies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 51808, "name": "Banks and credit markets", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Banks_and_credit_markets?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 83555, "name": "Housing finance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Housing_finance?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 88183, "name": "Credit", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Credit?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 93781, "name": "Jim Crow Segregation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jim_Crow_Segregation?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 31098789, "title": "Racial formation, inequality and the political economy of web traffic", "created_at": "2017-01-27T18:35:06.089-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31098789/Racial_formation_inequality_and_the_political_economy_of_web_traffic?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_31098789", "summary": "Few studies attempt to demonstrate whether and how systemic\nracial inequality might form on the web.

The course provides an opportunity to reflect on the role of the humanities in how we learn, think, and engage in both the natural and cultural world. We will begin by posing fundamental questions about what nature is and how it has come to be. Then, we will examine a range of texts to explore the intersection of social injustice and environmental issues. We will assess how cultural assumptions and perceptions of nature inform environmental values, perspectives and practices, and shape structures of power and privilege.

The data obtained in the field study carried out in Stockholm, G\u00f6teborg and Malm\u00f6 cities, the most densely inhabited cities by Turks, and the analysis of the data was made using SPSS 18 programme. When the data obtained are analysed, it is revealed that Turks in Sweden care for the identity formation representing their homeland and its continuation in socio-cultural terms, and they generally tend to be conservative in this sense. Nevertheless, it is also understood that the contact of Turks in Sweden with Turkish culture and Turkey is gradually decreasing (when it compared to the past). This also reveals the differences between the generations. When that 3rd generation young Turks born in Sweden came to Turkey, they generally do not feel like in their homeland, but in a foreign country or a country they visit as guests, and this also related to this kind of change.

Useful Idiots (2004), a young adult novel by British author Jan Mark, acts as the focus of my analysis because it is a fantasy novel that offers readers a highly innovative and unconventional exploration of the social discourses that construct and perpetuate racial hierarchies. Using David Lyon's theories about modern surveillance, whiteness studies and Bakhtin's concept of grotesque realism as a theoretical framework, this article argues that Mark inventively interrogates numerous assumptions that underpin race in modern society by depicting a character who, throughout the course of the narrative, gradually becomes a racialised subject. The portrayal of this process constitutes a highly effective and original representation of what it means to be considered \u2018the other\u2019.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36932612, "asset_id": 11361861, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10229343, "first_name": "Victoria", "last_name": "Flanagan", "domain_name": "mq", "page_name": "VictoriaFlanagan", "display_name": "Victoria Flanagan", "profile_url": "https://mq.academia.edu/VictoriaFlanagan?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10229343/3136515/16497566/s65_victoria.flanagan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4255, "name": "Children's and Young Adult Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Childrens_and_Young_Adult_Literature?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7480, "name": "Surveillance Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Surveillance_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 10909614, "title": "Reggaeto\u0301n, dancehall, mode-up.

The interview data highlight the relationship between these teachers\u2019 understandings of their racial identity and the responsibil- ities and challenges they anticipated for themselves as Asian American teachers of other students of color.

Still, these migrations are not unidirectional and homogeneous at all, but contain multi-layered and diverse forms of movement. In this book we present some outcomes of a recent research project which we carried out in analysing movements from members of Romani communities in southern Slovakia to the Austrian province of Styria. These discussed communities are neither linguistically separated nor in terms of housing strictly segregated from their mostly Hungarian surrounding. Nevertheless, the migrations \u2013 initially for the purpose of begging \u2013 and especially their effects foster differentiation and even an increase of segregation tendencies. In particular, the projects of NGOs in the region and the depiction of Romani people in Austrian media has shaped the othering of these Hungarian Slovakian citizens of Romani belonging.\r\nIn an introductive overview on the character of these migrations, we argue that these movements are transnational, not only because they are circular (instead of once-and-forever), but also because they question the notion of seemingly traditional migratory patterns. One of the effects of the migrations has been the emergence of a relatively strong connection between the regions involved, highly visible in the symbolical relationship between the village of Medovce-Metete  and Graz. Not only have development projects by Austrian NGOs and official support from local governments in Austria changed the situation in this village, but the presence of begging Romani people has shaped political debates and self-perceptions in Graz. These effects and relationships can most adequately be described as a transnational network that allows the movement of people, goods, money, knowledge etc. \r\nThis book is based on material from our field researches in South-central Slovakia (called the Gemer/G\u00f6m\u00f6r region), and Graz, deriving first and foremost from interviews with migrants, NGO-activists, officials and non-migrating people, which we carried out from September 2010 until February 2011. The second basis for this book are images and texts from coverage in different forms of media, such as newspapers and magazines, but also graffiti in public space, bulk mail, etc., from 1989 to 2011. We set these sources in dialogue with one other and thus map a space across the borders between language and action as well as the borders of nations/regions. In doing so, it becomes visible that there are huge intersections and interdependences between perceptions of these migrations, the circumstances in which they happen and the consequences they have (like development aid).

seinen Sachargumten\n\nDieser Aufsatz von Andreas Vonderach umrei\u00dft in einer Dichte wie bislang kein zweiter bekannter deutschsprachiger Aufsatz den wissenschaftlichen Paradigmenwechsel, der hinter den naturwissenschaftlichen Sachargumenten von Thilo Sarrazin steht, und f\u00fcr den ich selbst in dem Manuskript \"200.000 Jahre Humanevolution\" (siehe n\u00e4chstes \"Paper\") viel Literatur zusammengestellt habe.

A more nuanced understanding of racial/ethnic matching effects moderated by contextual factors may help policy makers' and administrators' assignment decisions on how to consider student and teacher race/ethnicity.\n\nPurpose/Objective/Research Question: This study examined the contextualized effects of racial/ethnic matching between high school students and teachers, focusing on the urbanicity of schools in the United States, by asking two main research questions: (1) What are the associations between the racial/ethnic matching of students and teachers, and students\u2019 math achievement and self-efficacy in the United States overall? (2) What are the associations among racial/ethnic matching, math achievement, and math self- efficacy in urban schools, and do these patterns differ for suburban and rural schools?\n\nResearch Design: This study used restricted-use national longitudinal data provided by the NCES High School Longitudinal Study of 2009. A strategy of disaggregating data by schools\u2019 urbanicity and three separate analyses with fixed-effect models for each urbanicity (urban, suburban, and rural) was followed to capture the variations across different schools\u2019 urbanicity and to obtain unbiased estimates of racial/ethnic matching effects.\n\nFindings/Results: Relatively lower percentages of Black, Hispanic, and Asian students were matched with their same-race/ethnicity math teachers compared with White students in all communities. This study found no supporting evidence for positive associations between racial/ethnic matching and math achievement scores and self-efficacy without considering urbanicity. Within the context of urbanicity, positive associations for math achievement were mainly found in the racial/ethnic matching of Black and Asian students taught by same-race/ethnicity teachers in suburban schools. Conversely, the racial/ethnic matching among Asian students and teachers in rural schools was significantly and negatively associated with both math achievement and self-efficacy.\n\nConclusions/Recommendations: By focusing specifically on schools\u2019 urbanicity contexts, policy makers and education leaders should consider the relatively lower percentage of racial/ethnic matching between Black students and teachers in suburban schools, and Hispanic students and teachers in rural schools. As rural Asian populations grow and diversify, Asian teachers from diverse cultural backgrounds are urgently needed in these communities. Contextualized policy solutions that consider school environments and cultural differences and that challenge the one-size-fits-all approach will ultimately better address the specific and diverse needs of students of color living in different communities across the United States.\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64839533, "asset_id": 44423937, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24587247, "first_name": "Sung Tae", "last_name": "Jang", "domain_name": "hku-hk", "page_name": "SungTaeJang", "display_name": "Sung Tae Jang", "profile_url": "https://hku-hk.academia.edu/SungTaeJang?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24587247/6647601/35564927/s65_sung_tae.jang.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27991, "name": "Equity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Equity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 369340, "name": "Critical urban theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_urban_theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 38973850, "title": "\"The Black Sox Scandal Revisited\" in Chasing Dreams: Baseball and Becoming American (National Museum of American Jewish History, 2014), 150-153", "created_at": "2019-04-29T14:02:21.759-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38973850/_The_Black_Sox_Scandal_Revisited_in_Chasing_Dreams_Baseball_and_Becoming_American_National_Museum_of_American_Jewish_History_2014_150_153?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_38973850", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59078670, "asset_id": 38973850, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 98660252, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Alexander", "domain_name": "ucriverside", "page_name": "Alexander", "display_name": "Michael S Alexander", "profile_url": "https://ucriverside.academia.edu/Alexander?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/98660252/46365233/35851504/s65_michael.alexander.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4989, "name": "Baseball", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Baseball?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11778, "name": "Baseball History & America", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Baseball_History_and_America?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28247, "name": "Modern Jewish History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Jewish_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 421114, "name": "American Jewish History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Jewish_History?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 37959140, "title": "Brandishing Guns: Performing Race and Belonging in the American West", "created_at": "2018-12-11T12:21:47.849-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37959140/Brandishing_Guns_Performing_Race_and_Belonging_in_the_American_West?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_37959140", "summary": "This article examines the racial dynamics and performative nature of US gun culture by analyzing the 2014 standoff between Cliven Bundy and the Bureau of Land Management. The standoff followed discernible scripts of white masculine privilege and drew on scenarios of conquest in the US American West, as Bundy's supporters gathered at his ranch and brandished their weapons in open defiance of the federal government. The act of brandishing their guns was a 'performance of belonging', a public, theatrical gesture that marks the bearer as a full participant in civic life and all its attendant rights and privileges. This belonging, however, is predicated on histories of white supremacist laws and settler colonialist violence. By reading gun culture in the United States through the lens of performance, this article traces the profound discrepancies between legal and practical gun rights and illuminates one of the most intractable debates at the center of US American life.

While both \"diversity\" and \"mix\" (mixed income or diversity of incomes, for example) are generally taken for granted terms in planning discourse, promoting more equitable planning practices requires analyzing them more closely in context. My analysis sheds light on tensions between various types of diversity, thereby challenging the potential for the framework to address structural inequality via revitalization.",

We find that a majority of U.S. adults now support, rather than oppose, allowing college athletes to be paid. Also, we find that White adults are especially unlikely, and Black adults are especially likely, to support allowing payment. Furthermore, recognition of racial/ethnic discrimination is positively, and indicators of traditionalism are negatively, associated with support for allowing college athletes to be paid.

Drawing on long-term ethnographic research in Santiago de Cuba, book reveals how Cuban families struggle to acquire food and assemble \u201ca decent meal,\u201d a local social category where families determine whether food quality and cultural-appropriateness meet their standards. The research illuminates the social and emotional dimensions of the practices of food acquisition. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s and subsequent the loss of its most significant trade partner, Cuba entered a period of economic hardship known as the \u201cSpecial Period.\u201d Although new trade agreements have significantly improved the quantity and quality of rationed food, supplies have not returned to Soviet-era levels. Several years after the worst scarcities of the Special Period, many people from Santiago reported that they continued to live with food shortages and economic hardship. This book reveals that one of the most common ways of dealing with food scarcity, was \u201cluchando la vida\u201d (struggling for life): the arduous task of finding ingredients seen as essential to what is considered a \u201cdecent\u201d meal. To understand this situation, the book introduces \u201cthe politics of adequacy,\u201d which details how people resist and make sense of scarcity or changing availability of basic life necessities, such as food. This work is based on intensive ethnographic fieldwork inside the homes of 22 families in Santiago de Cuba, the island\u2019s second largest city. Spanning neighborhood, social class, household income level, and skin color, this book captures previously undocumented details of household dynamics, community interaction, and individual reflections on everyday life in Cuba today. \n\nBook Keywords: Food, Cuba, Socialism, Inequality, Consumption, Adequacy, Caribbean, Distribution, Household, Everyday Life\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61600894, "asset_id": 41413141, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 801239, "first_name": "Hanna", "last_name": "Garth", "domain_name": "ucsd", "page_name": "HannaGarth", "display_name": "Hanna Garth", "profile_url": "https://ucsd.academia.edu/HannaGarth?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/801239/289469/14379233/s65_hanna.garth.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 262, "name": "Human Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Geography?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 388, "name": "Latin American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1250, "name": "Latin American and Caribbean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_and_Caribbean_History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2727, "name": "Welfare State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Welfare_State?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3472, "name": "Political Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Anthropology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3725, "name": "Cuban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cuban_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3870, "name": "African Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 21219, "name": "Socialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socialism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 22665, "name": "Post-Socialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Socialism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 24103, "name": "Anthropology of the State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_the_State?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 43678, "name": "Food Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 49663, "name": "Women and Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_Gender_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 53343, "name": "Social Welfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Welfare?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 112253, "name": "Critical Food Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Food_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 168567, "name": "Latin America and the Caribbean", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_America_and_the_Caribbean?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 35479897, "title": "\"Why Do They Get to Use the N-Word but I Can't?\" Privilege, Power, and the Politics of Language", "created_at": "2017-12-20T11:36:40.796-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35479897/_Why_Do_They_Get_to_Use_the_N_Word_but_I_Cant_Privilege_Power_and_the_Politics_of_Language?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_35479897", "summary": "Explores the use of the \"n-word\" in rap music and hip hop culture.

long as racism has been associated with sport there have been consistent, if not coordinated or coherent, struggles to confront its various forms. Critical race theory (CRT) is a framework established to challenge these racialized inequalities and racism in society and has some utility for anti-racism in sport. CRT\u2019s focus on social justice and transformation are two areas of convergence between critical race theorists and anti-racists. Of the many nuanced and pernicious forms of racism, one of the most obvious and commonly reported forms of racism in sport, racial abuse, has been described as a kind of dehumanizing process by Gardiner (2003), as those who are its target are simultaneously (re)constructed and objectified according to everyday myth and fantasy. However, this is one of the many forms of everyday racist experiences.Various forms of racism can be experienced in boardrooms, on television, in print, in the stands, on the sidelines and on the pitch. Many times racism is trivialized and put down as part of the game (Long et al., 2000), yet its impact is rarely the source of further exploration.This article will explore the conceptualization of \u2018race\u2019 and racism for a more effective anti-racism. Critical race theory will also be used to explore the ideas that underpin considerations of the severity of racist behaviour and the implications for anti-racism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 11527551, "asset_id": 1473646, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 77488, "first_name": "Kevin", "last_name": "Hylton", "domain_name": "leedsbeckett", "page_name": "KevinHylton", "display_name": "Kevin  Hylton", "profile_url": "https://leedsbeckett.academia.edu/KevinHylton?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/77488/21489/3073072/s65_kevin.hylton.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 218, "name": "Sociology of Sport", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Sport?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25806, "name": "Physical Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Physical_Education?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 49905, "name": "Sport", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sport?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 63097, "name": "Exercise Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exercise_Science?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 77311540, "title": "Racialized classroom practices in a diverse Amsterdam primary school: the silencing, disparagement, and discipline of students of color", "created_at": "2022-04-22T18:10:02.734-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77311540/Racialized_classroom_practices_in_a_diverse_Amsterdam_primary_school_the_silencing_disparagement_and_discipline_of_students_of_color?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_77311540", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84720043, "asset_id": 77311540, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 165844, "first_name": "Melissa", "last_name": "Weiner", "domain_name": "holycross", "page_name": "MelissaWeiner", "display_name": "Melissa Weiner", "profile_url": "https://holycross.academia.edu/MelissaWeiner?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/165844/87537/7762134/s65_melissa.weiner.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 39525, "name": "Discipline", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Discipline?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 90027, "name": "Classroom Practices", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Classroom_Practices?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 107201, "name": "Race Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 169804, "name": "The Netherlands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Netherlands?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 953669, "name": "Routledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Routledge?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 74531529, "title": "The man-not: race, class, genre, and the dilemmas of black manhood", "created_at": "2022-03-25T03:18:28.058-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/74531529/The_man_not_race_class_genre_and_the_dilemmas_of_black_manhood?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_74531529", "summary": "cated to \u2018Further Reading,\u2019 readers are referred to Anderson\u2019s Inclusive Masculinity: The Changing Nature of Masculinities, which is \u2018noteworthy insofar as it offers a critique of Connell\u2019s now almost hegemonic concept of hegemonic masculinity\u2019 (50). This is the totality of treatment we see for Inclusive Masculinity Theory, save a very brief discussion in the chapter on sexuality. Whether one agrees or disagrees with IMT is not quite the point, rather, the point is that IMT has had a significant role in the critical study of men and masculinities \u2013 even if writing in opposition to it. This underdevelopment or absence becomes all the more obvious in the chapter on sexuality, where Edley draws on a \u2018much cited paper\u2019 by C. J. Pascoe, which shows the \u2018dislocation of masculinity and sexuality, not least because it would appear to be a relatively new phenomenon\u2019 (129), but Pascoe is not alone in exploring the phenomenon. Admittedly, there is a brief mention of Anderson\u2019s work, but it feels unfinished, tentative, uncertain. Moreover, what can be said of the recent interest in queer theory and men\u2019s studies on \u2018sex on the down low,\u2019 or straight men having sex with men? While the chapter on sexuality devotes a few pages to \u2018gay masculinities,\u2019 it overlooks other forms of sexuality or sexual practices.

Yet, contrary to popular beliefs in the fairness of public policies and formal statutes under the United States constitution, the historical movements of people of color in America through private and public spaces contradict the fundamental principles of free movement. Forced movement serves as a mirror to mobility and the right to choose where one may live.\n\nBoth Japanese Americans and African Americans passed through the bounds and limits of cultural landscapes of mobility in the Western Addition of San Francisco, structured through uneven access to American citizenship and civil rights. Japantown nearly disappeared during World War II as a result of the forced movement of Japanese Americans into concentration camps. Beginning in the 1950s, the City of San Francisco\u2019s Redevelopment Agency removed from the Western Addition African American migrants newly arrived from Jim Crow South and Japanese Americans returning from concentration camps, destabilizing both minority communities.\nThe mass incarceration of Japanese Americans initiated in Japantown unanticipated property exchanges; different types of occupancies and commerce in existing buildings, and new relationships between dominant groups, Japanese Americans, and African Americans in Japantown. This paper will examine the comings and goings of Japanese Americans and African Americans in the Western Addition of San Francisco as a way of understanding the mutable character of housing and differences in use over time that are structured by zones of exclusion, property loss, and disenfranchisement as a result of forced movement and racial discrimination.  \n\nThis detailed study of a building located in San Francisco\u2019s Japantown at 1746 Post Street, constructed in 1923 for the First Reformed and Evangelical Church and demolished in 2007, illuminates movement into and out of one particular site. Through different means, Japanese Americans and African Americans occupied or owned this property. In its last transformation, the building was converted into offices and a publishing plant for Hokubei Mainichi, a bi-lingual newspaper. The New People\u2019s building, a new multi-use building with retail shops, a media center, caf\u00e9, theater, and the American headquarters of the Japanese company, VIZ Pictures, Inc., has been built on the site. The history of 1746 Post Street will provide a micro-analysis of space and the complex resiliency of global and migrant neighborhoods through forced movement, negotiation, loss, and exchange of property. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38616567, "asset_id": 15285036, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3649393, "first_name": "Lynne",

This plantation system in the countryside differed from the urban environment of the island. The dominant white patriarchy was still in place in the urban environments but there were ways in which the oppressed people of colour managed to create a living within a society that treated them as inferiors. However, there is a great deal of ambiguity in what counts as a success for people of colour, in part caused by the definitions used at the time to differentiate the populations based upon skin colour. The population was broken down into three categories, the enslaved black population, the white population and the numerically small population of freed persons of African descent, referred to as the \"free coloured\" population. It was predominantly this population that benefitted in the urban environment of Barbados although they still faced many of the same struggles as the enslaved blacks and free black population. Karl Watson points out that that there was 'no deliberate attempt by the white population to create a free coloured group. On the contrary, such a development was not welcomed'1. Segregation was not legally enforced but the social structure relegated poor whites and free coloureds to the fringes of society. Yet, a number of free coloureds and freed blacks were able to assert themselves as entrepreneurs in the economic sector that was managed by the white population. A further threat was the increase in economically successful free coloured women in the latter half of the eighteenth century who also gained social connection across the island and with the white elite. However, these women threatened the economic and social power dynamic that the white population benefited from and thus were still subjected to discrimination and dehumanisation, particularly the women who managed to establish themselves as businesswomen earning a substantial living. As such, thanks to their economic success, it could be said that these people, especially the women, thrived in this economic environment.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64229299, "asset_id":

Here, we review recent polling, as well as our own series of experiments, to elucidate racial divides in attention, attitudes, and reactions to police violence and protest against it (e.g., Black Lives Matter). In addition, we report linguistic analyses of descriptions (N = 195) of protest images, showing that Black participants better understand the causes of these protests (d = .30) and view them more positively (d = .38) than Whites. If we wish for consensus on how to address police violence and protest against it, we must understand how and why the sociopolitical reality of race leads to divergent views of these issues.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54556776, "asset_id": 34698529, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 164578, "first_name": "Colin Wayne", "last_name": "Leach", "domain_name": "barnard", "page_name": "ColinWayneLeach", "display_name": "Colin Wayne Leach", "profile_url": "https://barnard.academia.edu/ColinWayneLeach?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/164578/62531/24609155/s65_colin_wayne.leach.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 254, "name": "Emotion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotion?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1697, "name": "Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Violence?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6942, "name": "Discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Discrimination?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 8206, "name": "Police", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Police?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 18338, "name": "Attitudes (Social Psychology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Attitudes_Social_Psychology_?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 21498, "name": "Affect/Emotion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Emotion?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 16070886, "title": "Erel, U.

This examination contributes to interdisciplinary discussions of female same-sex sexuality, violence, race, and citizenship. Using fifteen months of ethnographic fieldwork, primarily with Afro-Brazilian women in the city of Salvador da Bahia, Allen argues that Brazilian lesbian women reject Brazilian cultural norms that encourage male domination and female submission through their engagement in romantic relationships with each other. At the same time Allen claims lesbian women also reproduce Brazilian cultural ideals that associate passion, intensity, and power with physical dominance through their engagement in infidelity and intimate partner violence. The book demonstrates that lesbian women are nonetheless marginalized as Brazilian citizens through widespread social and political invisibility despite these apparent displays of masculinized power.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38867210, "asset_id": 14964289, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1975754, "first_name": "Andrea Stevenson", "last_name": "Allen", "domain_name": "utoronto", "page_name": "AndreaStevensonAllen", "display_name": "Andrea Stevenson Allen", "profile_url": "https://utoronto.academia.edu/AndreaStevensonAllen?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1975754/655363/11415769/s65_andrea_stevenson.allen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 388, "name": "Latin American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1663, "name": "Domestic Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Domestic_Violence?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3986, "name": "Brazilian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brazilian_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4918, "name": "Gay And Lesbian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gay_And_Lesbian_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5044, "name": "Embodiment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Embodiment?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 9821, "name": "Brazil", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brazil?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 11070, "name": "Pleasure", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pleasure?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 12471, "name": "Violence Against Women", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Violence_Against_Women?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 19219, "name": "Infidelity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Infidelity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 34253, "name": "Candombl\u00e9", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Candombl%C3%A9?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 46811, "name": "Intimate Partner Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intimate_Partner_Violence?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 49663, "name": "Women and Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_Gender_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 96829, "name": "Salvador - Bahia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Salvador_-_Bahia?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 212444, "name": "CARNAVAL", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/CARNAVAL?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 980525, "name": "Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lesbian_Gay_Bisexual_Transgender_Studies?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 68467046, "title": "\u2018Why do (White) Evangelicals need to be reminded that black lives matter?\u2019 \u2013 a response", "created_at": "2022-01-16T20:46:55.773-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/68467046/_Why_do_White_Evangelicals_need_to_be_reminded_that_black_lives_matter_a_response?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_68467046", "summary": "My critiques of Ybarrola\u2019s work arise mostly from ways in which his analysis overly confines itself to the US context, and ignores the wider world, e.g. the impact on Blacks outside of the US of what happens in the US.

Though humanitarianism in the border context has been researched at European and United States-Mexico borders, the specifically gendered implications of humanitarian governance at borders needs further investigation. Drawing on interviews and participant observation with a religious humanitarian organization on the Moroccan side of the border and with medical humanitarians and social workers on the Spanish side, we researched women humanitarians' interventions toward migrant women from West African, North African and Middle Eastern countries. Beyond the differences that characterize these religious and socio-medical humanitarian settings and the different migration regimes in which they are inscribed, we argue that the power exerted by women humanitarians reproduces a form of maternalism underpinned by gendered moral beliefs regarding women's bodies, mobility and family life. We foreground that such maternalism represents a cornerstone of women's humanitarian engagement across time and we identify continuities between colonial maternalism, contemporary forms of humanitarian care carried out by women and maternalist integration politics in Western postcolonial societies. Rooted in colonial maternalism, racialized beliefs justified women's (religious, medical, social) prominent role in intervening in the intimate spaces of women casted as radically Other. Our contemporary case studies demonstrate how the practices of women humanitarians impact on racialized migrant women's daily lives, intruding on their intimacy, imposing controls over their bodies and impacting on their possibilities for mobility.

My book aims at building a bridge between the theoretical studies and the policy of ethnicity. Although this paper is primarily targeted at the academic community, it should also be expedient for readers involved in the legislation, administration of culture, education and ethnic relations. As any theoretical attempt to understand a phenomenon, this study, first of all, sought to describe the object \u2013 the interplay between ethnicity and politics \u2013 as precisely as possible. To achieve that, it was necessary to define the concepts and the terms relating to the ethnic processes. Correct periodization and typology of the phenomena under investigation were also endeavoured. Furthermore, the book undertook an effort to clarify the proximate and ultimate causes of ethnic mobilisation and the conflict alongside with the development of individual ethnic identity and ethnogenesis with a view of explaining the influence of political factors. Finally, the study adds to the understanding which methods for the regulation of the ethnic conflicts would be the most appropriate under the identified conditions.

Some benefits include Zakat's impacts on fostering social cohesion, providing a safety net for the poor, and forcing capital circulation in the market. Zakat, as annual stimuli to the economy, is one dimension that is understudied and theorized, which should be viewed as part and parcel, if not a central aspect of capitalizing various sectors of the economy on regular intervals. The circulation of money and products in the market, among a diverse set of actors, are central to a healthy economy and balanced growth. I use the term \" growth \" here not in its current sense of boom to bust trajectory, but rather in the sense of assisting individuals and communities move towards a balanced productivity and earning an honest living to support pursuit of their potential in life. Parking massive amounts of wealth for prolonged periods of time to avoid the \" dangers \" of the market is the strategy pursued by the rich. The security of wealth and steady investments represent the very cautious approach but in reality, the returns are limited and the growth is stagnant and sometimes mostly driven through dependence on movement in interest rates and shifts in tax burdens in current global capitalist economies. At times of economic crisis and uncertainty, the wealthy and banks tend to freeze the circulation of capital into the market, thus causing further deterioration of the market conditions and possible a greater loss or depreciation of the assets. The countermeasures to an economic crisis and freezing of money circulation include building confidence and infusing liquidities into the market. We did witness these measures in 2008, post the economic crisis, but the problem was that the bulk of this infusion of liquidity from tax-payers' pockets was directed at the banks and corporations that caused the collapse in the first place, while the middle class and the poor ended-up subsidizing the rich and wealthy. While the economy recovered in many parts of the world, the growth and expansion, however, in the past ten years, have gone to the 1% global top, while the rest saw their income and wealth stagnate or go into the negative. Furthermore, the process is stoking a massive boom cycle that is heading in the near future into a deeper and more complex bust. The short discussion above is important and very much connected to Zakat as annual capital stimuli to the economy with a heavy focus on the consumer products side of the market. Taking the 2.5% annual Zakat on wealth, which is paid by those who have set aside capital for a period of a year is the opposite of a trickle-down economics. The current tax and corporate codes in the U.S. is based on a trickle-down economic theory, which posits that the more money we give to those on top the more jobs, investment, and growth is generated. However, the evidence from previous periods of trickle-down economics policies shows that this kind of measures ended in economic disasters and the shrinking of the real income and wealth for the poor and middle class. More capital in the hands of the wealthy did not and will not translate to real growth or expansion of economic opportunities in the market but only produce a fictitious boom followed by a certain bust that punishes the poor and middle class again. Zakat is an annual stimulus to the market and is carried out through a net transfer of real capital from the wealthy to those who qualify according to established criteria. The poor, needy and indebted, among the 8 categories, receive the capital which is immediately infused into the market to address pressing needs. The trickle-down economic model results in wealth accumulation and the further removing of liquidity from the market, the opposite of the claims made by those who champion this theory. Assuming a Zakat eligible person receives $1000, there is a possibility that this amount is used to pay rent, buy food, fix the fridge, and other deferred items. Here, we have an important outcome of the Zakat expenditures, which resulted in putting capital into circulation by means of the expenditures undertaken by the recipients. For a period of time, I was thinking about the Qur'anic and Hadith texts that speak or define Zakat both as a purification and as a growth in wealth for those who give it out. The existing classical explanation viewed growth in terms of rewards in the afterlife, a correct metaphysical understanding, but I wanted to explore its temporal impact since they are interconnected.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56518174, "asset_id": 36590555, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 150150, "first_name": "Hatem",

By the late 1920s Arabic speakers were one of the country\u2019s largest immigrant groups. This book explores their experience, which was quite different from the danger and deprivation faced by twenty-first-century immigrants from the Middle East. Hyland shows how Syrians and Lebanese, Christians, Jews, and Muslims adapted to local social and political conditions, entered labor markets, established community institutions, raised families, and attempted to pursue their individual dreams and community goals. By showing how societies can come to terms with new arrivals and their descendants, Hyland addresses notions of belonging and acceptance, of integration and opportunity. He tells a story of immigrants and a story of Argentina that is at once timely and timeless.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54828419, "asset_id": 34965737, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 384703, "first_name": "Steven", "last_name": "Hyland Jr.", "domain_name": "wingate", "page_name": "StevenHyland", "display_name": "Steven Hyland Jr.", "profile_url": "https://wingate.academia.edu/StevenHyland?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/384703/119822/24220097/s65_steven.hyland_jr..jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 388, "name": "Latin American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2015, "name": "Middle East Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_East_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 9813, "name": "Argentina", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Argentina?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 16472, "name": "Transnational migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_migration?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 20550, "name": "Southern Cone (Area Studies)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southern_Cone_Area_Studies_?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 31971867, "title": "Low, D.

Mart\u00ed and Rodr\u00edguez de Ti\u00f3 became good friends and avid advocates for the independence of their own and each other\u2019s country, as Cuba and Puerto Rico remained the last bastions of Spain\u2019s Empire in the Caribbean. The verses were a testimony of the similar histories the two islands developed under four centuries of Spanish rule. They can also be seen as a chilling presage of what was to come after the U.S. won the Spanish American War in 1898 and became a consistent presence in the future of both countries, as U.S. decisions and U.S. policies have affected the way Cubans and Puerto Ricans live their lives on both their respective islands and the US mainland as well.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38419964, "asset_id": 14741047, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33786622, "first_name": "Cheirs", "last_name": "Brewer", "domain_name": "wallawalla", "page_name": "CheirsBrewer", "display_name": "Cheirs Brewer", "profile_url": "https://wallawalla.academia.edu/CheirsBrewer?f_ri=5453", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 110431, "first_name": "Carmen R.", "last_name": "Lugo-Lugo", "domain_name": "wsu", "page_name": "CarmenRLugoLugo", "display_name": "Carmen R.

Are they sufficiently coherent that they can be applied in every possible context, or do they rather only make sense when looking at the \u2018other\u2019? And are there ways and means to describe the phenomena that we encounter in fundamentally different ways, rather than just replacing one shaky term with another?\nIn this article I want to address these questions from a trans-disciplinary area studies perspective.  Modern area studies, which go beyond merely studying a nation-state environment, are helpful in overcoming eurocentric approaches, which are often still very much engrained in the \u2018classical\u2019 disciplines. Taking inspiration from disciplines such as sociology, psychology, and discourse analysis, and adjusting and testing them outside a predominantly white, \u2018Western\u2019 environment may produce better results not only when looking at the area of the \u2018other\u2019, but also one\u2019s own area, \u2018at home\u2019.\nOne of the outcomes of this direction is an alternative approach, in terms of concept as well as terminology, to the phenomena we often describe along the lines of race and ethnicity: the layered concept of ethnicization as a processual framework of analysis. In order to provide a new perspective, such an approach must go beyond classical counter-arguments with regard to race and ethnicity, with the bottom line that everything related to these is constructed. It must take into account the power that notions of race and ethnicity have in real life, but at the same time avoid reinforcing notions of homogeneity, and instead underline the processual aspect of group and identity formation. This may not be an easy task, and might challenge accustomed and convenient categories often used when analyzing group dynamics and relations. But in the end it is a worthwhile endeavor that opens up more differentiated views of the underlying issues at stake, which are all too easily overlooked when focusing on the rather static categories of race and ethnicity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54218377, "asset_id": 14715969, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 139734, "first_name":

"summary": "This article sets out the case for taking account of hotels in political geography. It argues that hotels, as key spaces of welcome, association, and entertainment between public and private, are important political sites. They provide space for the performance of political ideologies and identities, where political campaigns can be made visible, where political relations can be illuminated and translated for international audiences, and where the \u2018little things\u2019 (Thrift, 2000, 2004) that construct political geographies can be examined. Drawing on theoretical discussions of hospitality, as well as work in political\r\ngeography, it explores the politics of multi-racial hospitality in the hotels of Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, between 1958 and 1962 in order to understand late colonial politics in Southern Africa. Considering three individual hotels, the paper elaborates their role as keys spaces in the landscape of exclusive \u2018European\u2019 sociability; as crucial sites in the enactment of and resistance to the colour bar; and as vantage points on Southern Rhodesian racial politics for international guests. The papers shows that far from being peripheral to the \u2018real\u2019 politics of diplomacy and government, hotels and the hospitable practises within them can be seen as crucial elements in the construction of local, national and international politics.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50892422, "asset_id": 1632477, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

With British travelers and authors routinely marveling at their comparative social autonomy, and marital and more temporary unions between European men and Burmese women remaining acceptable until the First World War, the country\u2019s female population as presented in colonial literature was an object as fascinating as it was contentious. In reading the female Burmese characters in both Rudyard Kipling\u2019s famed poem, \u201cMandalay\u201d, and Bithia Mary Croker\u2019s Anglo-Indian romance novel, The Road to Mandalay, different and to a degree competing visions of the British empire emerge. In Kipling, colonies such as Burma offer the colonizing man a sphere freed from the moral duties prescribed by the metropole, while in Croker, moral diligence is demanded as a safeguard against the perils inherent to non-British\u2014that is to say, non-white\u2014societies. In each case, the specter of the Burmese woman represents a different figuration of empire for the narrative\u2019s protagonist, suggesting that this colonial archetype was imagined in terms that reflected the gendered roles of colonizing women and men.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65895741, "asset_id": 45364933, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 113108197, "first_name": "Sean", "last_name": "Smith", "domain_name": "kuleuven", "page_name": "spsmith", "display_name": "Sean P Smith", "profile_url": "https://kuleuven.academia.edu/spsmith?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/113108197/31000676/86389441/s65_sean.smith.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20652, "name": "Colonial literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_literature?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27881, "name": "Burma Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Burma_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 39559, "name": "Rudyard Kipling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rudyard_Kipling?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 11524825, "title": "James Baldwin's Afro-Optimism", "created_at": "2015-03-19T05:55:31.175-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11524825/James_Baldwins_Afro_Optimism?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_11524825", "summary": "This essay examines the intersection of pessimism, optimism, and race in Baldwin's non-fiction.

Sounding Race in Rap Songs argues that rap music allows us not only to see but also to hear how mass-mediated culture engenders new understandings of race. The book traces the changing sounds of race across some of the best-known rap songs of the past thirty-five years, combining song-level analysis with historical contextualization to show how these representations of identity depend on specific artistic decisions, such as those related to how producers make beats. Each chapter explores the process behind the production of hit songs by musicians including Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, The Sugarhill Gang, Run-D.M.C., Public Enemy, N.W.A., Dr. Dre, and Eminem. This series of case studies highlights stylistic differences in sound, lyrics, and imagery, with musical examples and illustrations that help answer the core question: can we hear race in rap songs?

South Tyrol lies on the southern slope of the Alps, with over 500,000 inhabitants. Both areas seem to have little in common. In reality, however, they are united by the peculiarity of autonomy and a common destiny. \u00c5land is populated by a Swedish population but became part of Finland after the First World War. South Tyrol was detached from its motherland Tyrol and Austria in the same period and became part of Italy. For both minorities, autonomy was supposed to be a substitute for self-determination. After difficult years, they acquired autonomy, which is often praised as a model for the solution of minority issues. This comparative study will analyse the extent of these autonomies and their strengths and weaknesses.\nThe comparison is also well suited because both autonomous provinces, South Tyrol and \u00c5land, not only belong to EU member states, but their kin states, Sweden and Austria, are also EU members.---------\n\nDEUTSCH\n\u00c5land liegt im hohen Norden, ist eine kleine Inselgruppe zwischen Schweden und Finnland mit nur 30.000 Einwohnern. S\u00fcdtirol liegt am S\u00fcdhang der Alpen, mit \u00fcber 500.000 Einwohnern. Beide Gebiete scheinen wenig gemeinsam zu haben. In Wirklichkeit verbindet sie aber die Besonderheit einer Autonomie und ein gemeinsames Schicksal. \u00c5land ist von einer schwedischen Bev\u00f6lkerung besiedelt, wurde aber nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg zu Finnland geschlagen. S\u00fcdtirol wurde in der gleichen Zeit von seinem Mutterland Tirol und \u00d6sterreich losgetrennt und zu Italien geschlagen. F\u00fcr beide Minderheiten sollte die Autonomie einen Ersatz f\u00fcr die Selbstbestimmung darstellen. Nach teils schwierigen Jahren erk\u00e4mpften sie sich eine Autonomie, die vielfach als Vorbild f\u00fcr die L\u00f6sung von Minderheitenfragen gepriesen wird. In dieser Vergleichsstudie soll analysiert werden, wie weit diese Autonomien reichen, und welche St\u00e4rken und Schw\u00e4chen sie aufweisen.\nDer Vergleich eignet sich auch deshalb gut, weil beide autonomen Provinzen, S\u00fcdtirol und \u00c5land, nicht nur zu EU-Mitgliedsstaaten geh\u00f6ren, sondern auch deren Beziehungsstaaten, Schweden und \u00d6sterreich, EU-Mitglieder sind. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67498583, "asset_id": 49103700, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5789618, "first_name": "Oskar", "last_name": "Peterlini", "domain_name": "unibz", "page_name": "OskarPeterlini", "display_name": "Oskar Peterlini", "profile_url": "https://unibz.academia.edu/OskarPeterlini?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5789618/2492606/2894935/s65_oskar.peterlini.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 294, "name": "Ethnic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 546, "name": "Comparative Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Law?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 547, "name": "Constitutional Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Constitutional_Law?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 796, "name": "Comparative Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Politics?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 7554, "name": "Comparative Constitutional Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Constitutional_Law?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14197, "name": "Autonomy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Autonomy?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 23890, "name": "Comparative Study", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Study?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 30160, "name": "Minority Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_Rights?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 54319, "name": "Minorities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minorities?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 84323, "name": "South Tyrolean question", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Tyrolean_question?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 313244, "name": "Verfassungsrecht", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Verfassungsrecht?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 996664, "name": "\u00c5land Islands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/%C3%85land_Islands?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 14165382, "title": "False memory and the associative network of happiness", "created_at": "2015-07-17T19:30:27.207-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14165382/False_memory_and_the_associative_network_of_happiness?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_14165382", "summary": "This research examines the relationship between indi- viduals\u2019 levels of life satisfaction and their associative networks of happiness.

My hypothesis is that these atlases are used in this region because a graphic presentation of the past makes it possible for students to grasp the idea of the presumably \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cinescapable\u201d overlapping of historical, linguistic, and demographic borders, the striving for which produced the present-day ethnolinguistic nation-states. Conversely, school history atlases provide a framework to indoctrinate the student with the beliefs that ethnolinguistic nationalism is the sole correct kind of nationalism, and that the neighboring polities have time and again unjustly denied the \u201ctrue and natural\u201d frontiers to the student\u2019s nation-state.\nKeywords \u2022 Central and Eastern Europe, ethnolinguistic nationalism, school history atlases", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46515368, "asset_id": 26192802, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1038344, "first_name": "Tom", "last_name": "Kamusella", "domain_name": "st-andrews", "page_name": "TomKamusella", "display_name": "Tom  Kamusella", "profile_url": "https://st-andrews.academia.edu/TomKamusella?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1038344/15014775/15750762/s65_tom.kamusella.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 201, "name": "Political Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Sociology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 280, "name": "Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cartography?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 383, "name": "European Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/European_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2196, "name": "History of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Education?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2524, "name": "Sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3392, "name": "Critical Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Pedagogy?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6878, "name": "History of Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Cartography?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 23050, "name": "Teaching History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 916401, "name": "Historical Atlases", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Atlases?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 25620676, "title": "FACILITY OF NOMMO: AFROCENTRIC RHETORICAL ANALYSIS OF BARACK OBAMA", "created_at": "2016-05-25T13:37:03.449-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/25620676/FACILITY_OF_NOMMO_AFROCENTRIC_RHETORICAL_ANALYSIS_OF_BARACK_OBAMA?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_25620676", "summary": "As the first African American President of the United States, Barack Obama has prompted celebrations across the country.

We stress the role of political culture in regulating the discussion and functioning of inclusion in crime control, including how \u201ccolor-blind\u201d racial ideology contributes to the dissonant pursuit of diversity without representation, undermining the realization of \u201cdeeply democratic\u201d criminal social control.

As the Court\u2019s final statement on the racial eligibility provisions of the early Naturalization Act, Thind has been the subject of significant scholarly commentary regarding race and citizenship in the United States and heralded as a crucial Asian American civil rights case. The article begins by analyzing the case\u2019s overruling of the majority of lower courts which had found high caste Hindus to be racially eligible for naturalization, two of which the Court had expressly approved of only three months earlier in Ozawa v. United States, a reversal of the Court\u2019s own position not addressed in Thind or by prior studies of the case. In an effort to account for this reversal, the article considers Thind\u2019s political activities in furtherance of Indian independence and the effort of British and American intelligence officials to oppose his naturalization on the basis of his political activities, the parties\u2019 competing citations of British authorities on the significance of India\u2019s caste system for the racial classification of Asian Indians, and how Justice Sutherland\u2019s opinion both responds to and evades the arguments in the case in a manner that suggests a political decision.

Countering many years of scholarship that privilege the stories of Rastafari men, Women and Resistance in the Early Rastafari Movement reclaims the voices and narratives of early Rastafari women in the history of the Black liberation struggle.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66624969, "asset_id": 44703239, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 20050871, "first_name": "Daive", "last_name": "Dunkley", "domain_name": "missouri", "page_name": "httpsblackstudiesmissouriedupeopledunkley", "display_name": "Daive Dunkley", "profile_url": "https://missouri.academia.edu/httpsblackstudiesmissouriedupeopledunkley?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/20050871/10463483/19500288/s65_daive.dunkley.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1138, "name": "Women's Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6873, "name": "Caribbean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caribbean_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 43245, "name": "Rastafari", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rastafari?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 266448, "name": "Reggae and Rastafari studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reggae_and_Rastafari_studies?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 44686925, "title": "\u041c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043c? \u0410\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0438\u043b\u044f\u0446\u0438\u044f? \u0423\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0438 \u0421\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0440\u0430 in Russian", "created_at": "2020-12-11T22:12:08.269-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44686925/%D0%9C%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BC_%D0%90%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%A3%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B8_%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B0_in_Russian?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_44686925", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65161114, "asset_id": 44686925, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24924157, "first_name": "Victor M", "last_name": "Kogan", "domain_name": "stmartin", "page_name": "VictorMKogan", "display_name": "Victor M Kogan", "profile_url": "https://stmartin.academia.edu/VictorMKogan?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24924157/6749625/7622879/s65_victor_m.kogan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44425956, "title": "No todo es armon\u00eda: G\u00e9nero y raza en la serie de televisi\u00f3n Mi Familia", "created_at": "2020-11-03T05:03:13.474-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44425956/No_todo_es_armon%C3%ADa_G%C3%A9nero_y_raza_en_la_serie_de_televisi%C3%B3n_Mi_Familia?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_44425956", "summary": "El prop\u00f3sito de esta investigaci\u00f3n es analizar el contenido, y las representaciones de la serie de television Mi Familia a la vez que estudiar de forma critica la recepci\u00f3n de la misma.

Elsewhere, in the literature on race and nationalism, scholars have concluded that the United States subscribes to cultural, color-blind racism, that has predominantly replaced biological racism. To explain the context in which white supremacy is again a viable political force in American politics, this paper argues that notions of biological racism that predate the Civil Rights Movement remain potent and continue to underlie cultural racism, and that that these out-group attitudes are not independent of in-group attitudes. This paper focuses on a form of dehumanization-simianization, or the depiction of racial groups (in this case African-Americans) as apes, tracing its origins in Enlightenment-era scientific racism, its historical role in shaping U.S. race and class relations, and as its role in defining American citizenship as hierarchical. Moreover, this paper presents evidence of simianization in contemporary political discourse surrounding African-Americans in the United States.

Between many of Emerson\u2019s pronouncements falls this shadow of Demonology, which I treat as a key aspect of his theories and essays of experience\u2014that is, those in which his contradictions are preeminent, unsettling, and thematic. If Emerson\u2019s transcendental pantheism is suffused with, or structured by, contradiction and doubling, \u201cDemonology\u201d is the essay that most fitfully \u201cperforms\u201d those inversions; in which the double emerges as twin and negative; and in which polar opposites become both coterminous and sequential in any direction (and therefore almost never linear in exposition).\n\tBoth as the essay and concept I focus on in this article, Demonology is not a tangent or coda to Emerson\u2019s work, but the cumulative residue of an attempt to codify that which resists his overarching theory that all forces, processes and attributes of nature are consistent, explicable, rational, and ultimately commensurate. Both its problematic provenance as an essay revised while Emerson suffered from failing mental acuity, and the way its tenets resist formalization, have led most scholars to treat \u201cDemonology,\u201d as an essay and concept, either as a digression or embarrassment. Critics of the day, however, seemed to realize that a protean Demonology was one of the definitive components of Emerson\u2019s pantheism. I reassess \u201cDemonology\u201d\u2014not just in spite of its inchoate status and troubled provenance, but in part because of it\u2014as an overlooked encapsulation of many of Emerson\u2019s ulterior tenets and a capstone of his metaphysics. In Lacanian terms, the contradictory or seemingly anomalous elements of \u201cDemonology\u201d represent the necessary remainders or gaps in his work that allow Emerson to address nature, a scenario complicated by the fact that the subject of these remainders is remainders. In other words, the subject of the essay is, implicitly, the cause of its own fragmentary nature. In never entirely stable ways, the demonological for Emerson represents specific forces within nature, but is also immanent to the system of nature.\t\n\t I also attempt to counter the lingering perception of Emerson as both a rationalist and idealist. No consistent transcendentalism generates or allows for Emerson\u2019s inconsistent pronouncements, because the inconsistency precedes the pronouncements at the level of ontology. A negation of the negation, Emerson\u2019s Demonology does not emerge in the register of symbolic spiritual transcendence, nor as part of an uplifting imaginary vision, but as a dark, racialized, feminized, and materialized \u201creal\u201d limit on established conventions.  Emerson\u2019s exposition of nature\u2019s Demonology, both in the eponymous essay and throughout his writings, thereby corroborates some poststructuralist as well as transcendental postulates.  Emerson\u2019s repeated emphasis on limitation, especially the limits of reason, bear some surprising affinities with Slavoj \u017di\u017eek\u2019s formulation of the Lacanian Real, which is why \u017di\u017eek offers a useful interpretative language for approaching \u201cDemonology\u201d in particular.

Right-wing forces across the globe have been able to push misogynist, homophobic and xenophobic discourses into the mainstream of politics and media. Whilst these developments have been fuelled by the neoliberal economic programmes unrolled since the 1970s, sexism and racism have always been anchored within the structures of real existing capitalism. This suggests, then, that many of the societal issues we are encountering today are rooted in structural disadvantage and oppression pertaining not only to economics and class but also to gender, race and ethnicity. Yet, approaches in Communication Studies and Cultural Studies have often engaged in separate interrogations of media misrepresentations in relation to either class and economics, or gender and/or race. On the other hand, intersectional scholarship has long highlighted how these societal spheres are interconnected and should thus be researched simultaneously. The Herman-Chomsky Propaganda Model constitutes the leading analytical tool to theorize and investigate media bias. The following contributions will conceptualize and illustrate how the PM relates to intersectional scholarship and societal structures. This will be done on the basis of theoretical elaborations and empirical case studies as well as broader discussions of the politics within the disciplines of Communications Studies and Cultural Studies. It will be demonstrated that the PM can be used to unveil interlocking media biases and misrepresentations deriving from parallel societal discriminations including classism, sexism and racism.",

It will help students develop an awareness of how processes of identity and community formation are inherently spatial. Roughly the first half of the course is focused on introducing core concepts. The second half examines the salience of those concept in understanding the politics of difference at various intertwined geographical scales from the body to the globe.

The paper discusses personal, academic and professional features of M\u00e9traux\u2019s ethnological experience, the nature of the 1929 trip and his concrete relationships with the Chiriguano groups and individuals. Next, we analyse his ideas on material culture as a privileged means of understanding the synthesis of Andean, Chaco and Amazonian cultural influences. Finally, the dilemmas and limitations of his analytical approach regarding Cr\u00e9ole cultural influence and social and cultural change are discussed. [Key words: Alfred M\u00e9traux, Chan\u00e9, Chiriguano, material culture, change.]\r\nSe analiza la etnolog\u00eda temprana de Alfred M\u00e9traux a la luz de su primer viaje de campo a los chiriguanos, en 1929. Se discute el perfil personal, acad\u00e9mico y profesional de M\u00e9traux, las peculiaridades de su trabajo de campo en 1929 y sus relaciones concretas con los ind\u00edgenas chiriguanos en el terreno. Se examinan luego sus ideas sobre la cultura material como campo experimental privilegiado para rastrear procesos de s\u00edntesis de influencias culturales andinas, chaque\u00f1as y amaz\u00f3nicas, as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n sus dilemas y l\u00edmites a la hora de interpretar el factor de la influencia criolla y el proceso de cambio social y cultural en un sentido amplio.

We examine the emergence and promotion of a national-level discourse that positioned schools in the service of the economy. Based on ethnographic research conducted in North Carolina, we then show how local growth elite utilized this discourse to further their own race and class interests to the exclusion and detriment of poorer, African American parents and students. We suggest that ethnographic studies of policy formation help to socially and historically contextualize contemporary debates and denaturalize unwarranted assumptions about the public good.",

rearticulation of the identity of black models in fashion is one that brings forth discussion about representation and the marketing opportunities of \u2018blackness\u2019. There have been improvements on diversity within the fashion industry, however, there is still a disproportional bias towards the use of white models featured in editorials and magazine covers. This dissertation discusses theory around \u2018otherness\u2019 and the marketing idea that \u2018black models don\u2019t sell\u2019.\nThe miscommunication between the imagery, model and consumer around the representation of black models is explored as well as whether they are as equally promoted as their white counterparts. If white is the measure of beauty by we are all measured by, are black models visualised as both exotic and as a fetish? Research is undertaken to explore consumer attitudes to representation as well quantitative analysis on the number of appearances of black models in Vogue and Elle magazine.\nIndustry attitudes to race are complex and made up of many layers influenced by colonialism and elitism. Who is to blame for the problem at hand? This dissertation sets out to discuss who dictates our visual consumption and whether it can be disrupted to allow for a spectrum of beauty that isn\u2019t limited to or restricted by skin colour. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46415004, "asset_id": 26067655, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 21021010, "first_name": "Latoyah", "last_name": "Prempeh", "domain_name": "ucreative", "page_name": "LatoyahPrempeh", "display_name": "Latoyah Prempeh", "profile_url": "https://ucreative.academia.edu/LatoyahPrempeh?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/21021010/8016502/8978507/s65_latoyah.prempeh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8, "name": "Critical Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 972, "name": "Self and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_and_Identity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1192, "name": "Feminist Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminist_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 251625, "name": "Fashion Models", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fashion_Models?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 638520, "name": "Fashion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fashion?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 16260387, "title": "Werewolves: Studies in Transformations", "created_at": "2015-09-28T03:51:40.072-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/16260387/Werewolves_Studies_in_Transformations?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_16260387", "summary": "WEREWOLVES: STUDIES IN TRANSFORMATION\r\nREVENANT JOURNAL \r\nISSUE 2, 2016\r\nGUEST EDITORS: KAJA FRANCK AND JANINE HATTER\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S INTRODUCTION\r\nKaja Franck and Janine Hatter, University of Hertfordshire and University of Hull\r\n\r\nARTICLES\r\nLYCANTHROPIC LANDSCAPES: AN ECOGOTHIC READING OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY WEREWOLF SHORT STORIES, Janine Hatter, University of Hull\r\n\r\n\u2018HER PRINCES WITHIN HER ARE LIKE WOLVES\u2019: THE WEREWOLF AS A CATHOLIC FORCE IN WAGNER, THE WEHR-WOLF, Abigail Boucher, University of Glasgow\r\n\r\nCLEMENCE HOUSMAN\u2019S THE WERE-WOLF: A CAUTIONARY TALE FOR THE PROGRESSIVE NEW WOMAN, Melissa Purdue, Minnesota State University-Mankato\r\nSALU\u2019AH: THE SHE-WOLF OF ARABIA, Hanan Alazaz, Lancaster University and Princess Norah University\r\n\r\nDIRTY, WILD BEASTS!

"dom_id": "work_2202709", "summary": "\"\"Recent research on mixed racial and ethnic couple and lone parents in Britain indicates that not only are they a diverse group, but that they also have a diversity of ways of understanding their difference and creating a sense of belonging for their children (Caballero, Edwards and Puthussery, 2008; Caballero, 2010; Caballero, 2011).  Such research strongly challenges the idea that there is \u2013 or should be \u2013 a single benchmark of how to raise children from mixed racial and ethnic backgrounds. Nevertheless,  placement decisions for children from mixed racial and ethnic backgrounds are often still rooted in longstanding and politicised assumptions about their identities and how best to instil a positive and healthy sense of self (Phoenix, 1999; Okitikpi, 2005; Goodyer and Okitikpi, 2007; Patel 2008).\r\n\r\nDrawing on three recent studies exploring the everyday experiences of lone and couple parents of mixed racial and ethnic children, this paper discusses the ways in which mixed racial and ethnic children who are not in the care system experience difference and belonging within their families and how they negotiate and manage these factors. In particular, the paper illustrates the types of strategies and supports that parents draw on to give their children a positive sense of identity and belonging, as well as the ways in which other issues can be more significant for mixed racial and ethnic children and their parents than what they often see as \u2018ordinary\u2019 internal family difference.\r\nArguing that the demographics and experiences of mixed racial and ethnic families are much more diverse and complex than is commonly imagined, the authors thus ask to what extent do policies and practice around the placement of mixed racial and ethnic children reflect the lives of those families outside the care system and, moreover, in what ways can or should the experiences of these families inform policy and practice for those within it? The paper points to a number of implications for adoption and fostering practice and policies emerging from a more multifaceted understanding of the everyday lives of racially and ethnically mixed families as presented by the authors. \r\n\"\"\"\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55611696, "asset_id": 2202709, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2501102, "first_name": "Rosalind", "last_name": "Edwards", "domain_name": "soton", "page_name": "RosalindEdwards", "display_name": "Rosalind Edwards", "profile_url": "https://soton.academia.edu/RosalindEdwards?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2501102/780548/969999/s65_rosalind.edwards.jpg"}, {"id": 853691, "first_name": "Chamion", "last_name": "Caballero", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ChamionCaballero", "display_name": "Chamion Caballero", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ChamionCaballero?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/853691/303681/62433056/s65_chamion.caballero.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6574, "name": "Family", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6664, "name": "Adoption", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Adoption?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29719, "name": "Critical Mixed Race Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Mixed_Race_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 42733, "name": "Adoption and Fostering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Adoption_and_Fostering?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 87079, "name": "Transracial Adoption", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transracial_Adoption?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 1567835, "title": "Chin, Christina, Meera E.

White people appear more often than all other groups combined, are represented through discernible stereotypes and advertise nearly all product categories. By contrast, blacks and non-Japanese Asians are associated with a narrower range. The former appear as musicians and athletes; the latter are either famous celebrities or associated with products from their countries of origin. These \u2018Others\u2019 are often stereotyped in ways that differentiate them from Japanese. Overall, this article provides insight into the attitudes of the Japanese toward \u2018Others\u2019, contributing both to the long-standing discourse of Japanese exceptionalism (nihonjinron) and the understanding of Japanese society in a globalizing world.

football club. The article is based on a three-year period of ethnographic fieldwork in a football club, located in an ethnically diverse neighborhood in the Netherlands. We argue that the transition led to contested understandings of cultural practices and artefacts within the club. The meaning-making processes of the club\u2019s organizational culture reinforced us-them divisions between the two groups. What is at stake is the symbolic ownership of the club that comes from a deep-rooted desire among members of sport clubs to be \u2018among themselves\u2019. The findings suggest that apparent equity in terms of shared participation in the club\u2019s management does not necessarily lead to bridging of ethnic differences on the level of the club\u2019s culture.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17430437.2013.821257#.UhMeTUoso4k

I argue that the dominant use of the concept of privilege cannot fulfill these conditions.

After liberated, the former slaves of south started to move to northern areas of the continent in search of jobs, opportunities and a new life. Reigions such as New York, Detroit, Chicago and Philedelphia were the cities of industry and were in demand of labour, thus these regions became popular areas for emancipated African-Americans. Within the following fifty years, especially with the breaking out of the World War I, the number of European immigrants coming to the United States decreased dramatically and this downfall led to a shortage of unskilled labour force. As a result, African-Americans continued to vacate their positions and eventually these industrial regions became African-American neighborhoods. One of the African-American neighborhoods, perhaps the most known one, is Harlem in New York. Throughout the 20s, Harlem was not only a neighborhood for the blacks but also became a cultural center for them. As a consequence of moving from rural to urban, they also took a step into sophistication and intellectualism. The concept of 'The New Negro', a term coined by the American writer and philosopher Alain Locke, and the Jazz culture started to blossom.

As cultural, social, and economic phenomena, examining them will further our understanding of the role of global media content in the digital age. Moreover, as these programs continue to be exported and transformed at regional levels, and through digitalization, it is more important than ever to analyze where the genre has been, where it is now, and where it is going.  This collection brings together original scholarship from an international and trans-disciplinary perspective. Chapters address timely issues, theories, and debates that are inextricably linked to soap operas and telenovelas as global industries, as sites for new audiences, and as hybrid cultural products within the digital landscape. Bringing depth and originality to the subject area, each chapter demonstrates the richness of these genres and their long-term significance as the televisual landscape evolves and becomes increasingly reliant on technological and creative innovations.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE CO-EDITORS\r\n\r\nDiana I.

This article examines how southerners interpreted the meanings and practices of the safety bicycle through a contingent spatial and mobility politics found at the intersection of race and technology. For African Americans, the bicycle was both a symbolic and real opportunity to express modern freedoms at the moment those freedoms were being curtailed. Black cyclists whether they used the bicycle for leisure or utilitarian purposes contested the meanings and limits of mobility in the early Jim Crow period. The South, however, was not the only region of the world where the politics of race shaped bicycle mobilities and this article points to the ways the African American experience of bicycle technology mirrors but does not necessarily replicate places beyond the United States. Ultimately, this article traces how technological innovations such as the safety bicycle can be both disrupt but also uphold structures of power.

For example, mourning might be understood as involuntarily surrendered time necessary to properly grieve, concede, and embrace Black people\u2019s subject position in the US sociopolitical con- text. Turning towards mourning, the dark moments that urge it and the dark(er) moments that it may produce, is argued as a launch pad to more fully understanding the depth and reach of Black people\u2019s possibility. To make such an argument the author contemplates how mourning, and subsequent meditations on possibility, might have informed the activism of leaders in the Black radical tradition who urgently insisted that Black people\u2019s human dignity be recognized and properly acknowledged. The article concludes with discussion of the significance of possibility to advance equity and excellence in education.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65794206, "asset_id": 45214078, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 622260, "first_name": "Chezare", "last_name": "Warren", "domain_name": "vanderbilt", "page_name": "ChezareWarren", "display_name": "Chezare A Warren", "profile_url": "https://vanderbilt.academia.edu/ChezareWarren?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/622260/215645/39684091/s65_chezare.warren.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18677, "name": "Race and Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Schooling?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44714, "name": "Black Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Education?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 59346, "name": "Blackness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Blackness?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 487947, "name": "Experiences of black and ethnic Minority students in Higher education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Experiences_of_black_and_ethnic_Minority_students_in_Higher_education?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 916518, "name": "Black Teachers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Teachers?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 14733193, "title": "Booing Adam Goodes \u2013 racism is in the stitching of the AFL", "created_at": "2015-08-07T01:42:43.698-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14733193/Booing_Adam_Goodes_racism_is_in_the_stitching_of_the_AFL?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_14733193", "summary": "Article written for The Conversation discussing the booing of Adam Goodes", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38408724, "asset_id": 14733193, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 74011, "first_name": "Keith", "last_name": "Parry", "domain_name": "bournemouth", "page_name": "KeithParry", "display_name": "Keith D Parry", "profile_url": "https://bournemouth.academia.edu/KeithParry?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/74011/20441/20250772/s65_keith.parry.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 218, "name": "Sociology of Sport", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Sport?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7125, "name": "Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11380, "name": "Australian Rules Football", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Rules_Football?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 49905, "name": "Sport", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sport?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 43376227, "title": "Apropria\u00e7\u00e3o cultural (Feminismos Plurais) - Rodney William", "created_at": "2020-06-18T07:36:01.220-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43376227/Apropria%C3%A7%C3%A3o_cultural_Feminismos_Plurais_Rodney_William?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_43376227", "summary": "Exu Oloj\u00e1 \u00e9 o dono do mercado. \u00c9 quem preside todas as trocas, interc\u00e2mbios,\nescambos,  transa\u00e7\u00f5es,  negocia\u00e7\u00f5es,  intera\u00e7\u00f5es  e  a  circula\u00e7\u00e3o  de  bens  e  produtos.\nExu \u00e9 o princ\u00edpio din\u00e2mico, a comunica\u00e7\u00e3o, o movimento.

These images were coded for frames that de-emphasize athleti-cism, sexualize athletes, or deny a sporting context. Results suggest that athlete sex is associated with de-emphasized athleticism and sexualized frames, and sport gender is associated with context frames. Results also support longitudinal trends in The Body Issue series, which suggest that the series has become more sexualized and removed from a sports context but has decreased the use of frames that de-emphasize athleticism.

Activists have responded by adopting a politics of autonomy based on race pride, territoriality, self-determination, and self-defense.

considers Amiri Baraka\u2019s writings and mass-media endeavors during the sixties and seventies, focusing specifically on his robust, albeit little-known, program of mass-communications initiatives, the \u201cBlack Communications Project\u201d (1966-). Discussing recently-digitized audio-visual materials relating to Baraka\u2019s interventions in film, popular music, and radio broadcasting, the talk delves into the ways he employed the particularities of mass-mediated address to meta-discursively theorize the formation of a virtual and non-essentialist Black-nationalist counterpublic. I take as representative of this effort a number of performative works in which Baraka transposed a fundamentally African antiphonal and collectivist modality of call-and-response discourse (as opposed to a lyrical and liberal-individualist one) onto the otherwise unidirectional situation of mass communication.

"Liberalism glorifies free speech as the primary means to achieve progress. Free  speech is presumed to involve a clear association across awareness, individual  voice, collective speaking, and increased representation. Michel Foucault  located a genealogy of related practices of speaking truth in the Stoic tradition  of parrhesia. However, as he established, liberalism limits speech, as centrism  and civility flatten all forms of speech as equivalent whereby all sides come to  matter. As demonstrated today, the alt-right and radical left are seen as equally  illiberal and asking for too much. Speech, specifically under liberalism, loses  its import. The article asks what happens when we free the concept of speech  from free speech and the liberal tradition. To explore this, the article turns to  disability, particularly deafness, to grapple with other formulations of speech. It  examines Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-Hsien\u2019s classic film A City of Sadness  (1989) and focuses on its representations of deafness and its disability aesthetics.  Hou\u2019s aesthetics and use of media objects establish a political critique that does  not rely on truth, repair, or recognition. This film develops a Marxist theory  of speech and reconsiders speech through other modes of governance like  autocracy. Ultimately, the article explores how different governance structures  rework not only speech but also notions of political change.

While these instances are thankfully rare it is important to understand how workplace bullying manifests in organizations and what employees, bystanders, and organizations can do about it. At the invitation of the editor to convene a diverse panel of experts on workplace bullying, seven scholars responded to questions pertaining to six workplace bullying related issues. These are: distinctions between bullying and other related terms; bystander intervention; the relationship between race, gender, and other marginalized identities and workplace bullying; interdisciplinary opportunities and constraints in workplace bullying research; developments in policy in the United States; and how can and should employees, bystanders, and organizations respond to workplace bullying.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65061126, "asset_id": 44171235, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26350815, "first_name": "Leah", "last_name": "Hollis", "domain_name": "bu", "page_name": "LeahHollis", "display_name": "Leah Hollis", "profile_url": "https://bu.academia.edu/LeahHollis?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26350815/7291692/8203118/s65_leah.hollis.jpg"}, {"id": 238026, "first_name": "Loraleigh", "last_name": "Keashly", "domain_name": "wayne", "page_name": "LoraleighKeashly", "display_name": "Loraleigh Keashly", "profile_url": "https://wayne.academia.edu/LoraleighKeashly?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/238026/9878374/11012045/s65_loraleigh.keashly.jpg"}, {"id": 40752300, "first_name": "Jerry", "last_name": "Carbo", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JerryCarbo", "display_name": "Jerry Carbo", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JerryCarbo?f_ri=5453", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 859, "name": "Communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communication?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6840, "name": "Workplace Bullying", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Workplace_Bullying?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 27879, "name": "Racial and ethnic discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_and_ethnic_discrimination?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 99082, "name": "Mobbing, Bullying, Workplace Harassment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobbing_Bullying_Workplace_Harassment?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 221269, "name": "Cyberbullying and Bystanders/Witnesses", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberbullying_and_Bystanders_Witnesses?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 43608290, "title": "Police endorsement of color\u2010blind racial beliefs and propensity to interact with youth of color", "created_at": "2020-07-13T14:02:20.759-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43608290/Police_endorsement_of_color_blind_racial_beliefs_and_propensity_to_interact_with_youth_of_color?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_43608290", "summary": "The beliefs of police, as the point of first contact with the justice system, may help to explain disproportionate minority contact between police and young people.

It explores key interdisciplinary concepts and methodologies, and how these are challenged by new realities and the links between contemporary migration patterns and its use of mediated processes. Although primarily grounded in media and communication studies, the Handbook builds on research in the fields of sociology, anthropology, political science, urban studies, science and technology studies, human rights, development studies, and gender and sexuality studies, to bring to the forefront key theories, concepts and methodological approaches to the study of the movement of people. In seven parts, the Handbook dissects important areas of cross-disciplinary and generational discourse for graduate students, early career researcher, migration management practitioners, and academics in the fields of media and migration studies, international development, communication studies, and the wider social science discipline. \n\n\n\nAdvance reviews: \n\nDue to the range of its themes, approaches, voices and contexts, this volume will be an indispensable guide to all scholars working on migration and media, and will furthermore open up a new space for methodological and conceptual reflection on a world in which movement and mediation are two sides of the same coin. -Arjun Appadurai, Goddard Professor of Media, Culture and Communication, New York University.\n\nHighlighting questions of power inequalities, processes, and dynamics within the intersections of media and migration, this book is a path-breaking vital and welcome contribution to migration and media studies. This Handbook provides insights into a central question of both these fields, that of representation and mediation. With careful attention paid to definitions, methodologies, and emerging issues, this book will be invaluable to scholars and students alike. - Nina Glick Schiller, Professor Emeritus, University of Manchester, UK.\n\nThis volume of over 50 chapters traverses enormous terrain in interrogating the entanglements of migration and media, highlighting the politics of encounter and the powerful combinations and permutations that shape contemporary migrant lives across the globe.

Borrowing from organizational studies, some of these scholars have used the term decoupling to conceptualize the widespread phenomenon of states that sign conventions but do not implement these conventions' norms. In this article, we introduce the concept of differentiated decoupling, arguing that the implementation of human rights norms needs to be rethought and reoperationalized. We present a case study\u2014the right to vote in the United States\u2014to illustrate our argument that it is vital to disaggregate the decoupling processes and examine the different social groups within the state rather than limit scrutiny to the state level. We further contend that in order to explain differentiated decoupling, perspectives developed and used by sociologists who study inequality need to be adopted. In this way, scholars can capture the unequal distribution of human rights in domestic settings and begin to untangle the forces leading to differentiated decoupling. An analysis of differentiated decoupling helps reveal that \" more human rights \" sometimes means more human rights to one group and less to another, suggesting that implementation of human rights norms may even deepen stratification.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48978734, "asset_id": 28614500, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25580780, "first_name": "Nitza", "last_name": "Berkovitch", "domain_name": "bgu", "page_name": "NitzaBerkovitch", "display_name": "Nitza Berkovitch", "profile_url": "https://bgu.academia.edu/NitzaBerkovitch?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/25580780/6992673/19013560/s65_nitza.berkovitch.jpg"}, {"id": 12766497, "first_name": "Neve", "last_name": "Gordon", "domain_name": "qmul", "page_name": "NeveGordon", "display_name": "Neve  Gordon", "profile_url": "https://qmul.academia.edu/NeveGordon?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12766497/3701175/6130842/s65_neve.gordon.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2169, "name": "Human Rights Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights_Law?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3210, "name": "Segregation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Segregation?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5321, "name": "International Human Rights Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Human_Rights_Law?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 7562, "name": "Civil Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Civil_Rights?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 30006, "name": "Voting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Voting?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 30160, "name": "Minority Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_Rights?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 206402, "name": "Decoupling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decoupling?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 502330, "name": "Felony Disenfranchisement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Felony_Disenfranchisement?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 37878873, "title": "The Visual Representation, Role and Origin of Black Soldiers in British Army Regiments During the Early Nineteenth Century", "created_at": "2018-11-29T13:25:41.487-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37878873/The_Visual_Representation_Role_and_Origin_of_Black_Soldiers_in_British_Army_Regiments_During_the_Early_Nineteenth_Century?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_37878873", "summary": "The thesis utilised contemporary visual and documentary evidence, (the latter including pension records and regimental description books containing physical descriptions facilitating the identification of black soldiers), in order to examine The Visual Representation, Role and Origin of Black Soldiers in British Army Regiments During the Early Nineteenth Century.

However, few studies have examined potential biases in adult observer ratings of children\u2019s pain. Cohen et al. (2014) reported that adult participants rated a child undergoing a medical procedure as feeling more pain when the child was described as a boy as compared to a girl, suggesting a possible gender bias. To confirm, clarify, and extend this finding, we conducted a replication experiment and follow-up study examining the role of explicit gender stereotypes in shaping such asymmetric judgments.\n\nMethod: In an independent, pre-registered, direct replication and extension study with open data and materials (https://osf.io/t73c4/), we showed participants the same video from Cohen et al. (2014), with the child described as a boy or a girl depending on condition. We then asked adults to rate how much pain the child experienced and displayed, how typical the child was in these respects, and how much they agreed with explicit gender stereotypes concerning pain response in boys versus girls.\n\nResults: Similar to Cohen et al. (2014), but with a larger and more demographically diverse sample, we found that the \u2018boy\u2019 was rated as experiencing more pain than the \u2018girl\u2019 despite identical clinical circumstances and identical pain behavior cross conditions. Controlling for explicit gender stereotypes eliminated the effect.\n\nConclusions: Explicit gender stereotypes\u2014e.g., that boys are more stoic or girls are more emotive\u2014may bias adult assessment of children\u2019s pain. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59114516, "asset_id": 36875734, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 377433, "first_name": "Brian D.", "last_name": "Earp", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "BrianDEarp", "display_name": "Brian D.

More precisely, as I argue in this paper, Fanon's work demonstrates how psychical and bodily spatiality cannot be adequately understood apart from the environing space of the social world. For Fanon, body, psyche, and world mutually influence and constitute each other. In a raced and racist world, therefore, the lived bodily experience and the unconscious of human beings will be racially and racist-ly constituted as well.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56438852, "asset_id": 36519273, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 15275220, "first_name": "Shannon", "last_name": "Sullivan", "domain_name": "uncc", "page_name": "ShannonSullivan", "display_name": "Shannon Sullivan", "profile_url": "https://uncc.academia.edu/ShannonSullivan?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/15275220/4410993/54421024/s65_shannon.sullivan.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25618, "name": "Phenomenology of Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology_of_Space_and_Place?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 32007, "name": "Frantz Fanon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Frantz_Fanon?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 36287893, "title": "The sociology of Stuart Hall", "created_at": "2018-03-29T17:14:22.953-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36287893/The_sociology_of_Stuart_Hall?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_36287893", "summary": "This brief essay animates two signature features of Stuart Hall\u2019s sociology,\ndiaspora and culture, to draw attention to not only the paradigms manifest in his work but also how they point to fruitful paths to guide the future of the field.

More recently, this history shows how systems of mental health provision and policy affect racialised 1 communities living in the west. For example, as late as 2003, an inquiry into the death of a 40-year old African Caribbean man, David Rocky Bennett led to an in-depth examination of mental health care in the UK. The report found the National Health Service to be \" institutionally racist \". 2 Institutional racism was defined in an earlier inquiry into the murder of a young black man, Steven Lawrence, as \" a feature of institutions where there are pervasive racist attitudes and practices, assumptions based on racial differences, practices and procedures which are discriminatory in outcome, if not in intent, and a tolerance or acceptance of such differences. \" 3 In Western countries where there are substantial populations of people from communities and backgrounds other than indigenous/occupying white populations, racial discrimination interacts with structural (social, cultural) discrimination against people deemed mad or \" mentally ill \". This multiple discrimination happens in several contexts affecting the practice and theory of psychiatry and mental health. We attempt to examine some of these contexts below in six sections: a) Racist underpinnings of the history and development of psychiatry; b) Racialised theories of the psyche, emotions and mental health/ill-health; c) Racism as cause and context for mental and emotional distress; d) Racial discrimination in relation to access of health and healing systems; e) Discrimination against alternative meanings and contexts of healing and health; and f) Multiple discrimination based on notions of 'race' and 'madness' within societies and communities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55365501, "asset_id": 35501919, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3810661, "first_name": "Jayasree", "last_name": "Kalathil", "domain_name": "survivor-research", "page_name": "JayasreeKalathil", "display_name": "Jayasree  Kalathil", "profile_url": "https://survivor-research.academia.edu/JayasreeKalathil?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3810661/1386082/3781296/s65_jayasree.kalathil.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2432, "name": "Critical Race Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2595, "name": "Critical Disability Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Disability_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2827, "name": "Mental Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mental_Health?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6182, "name": "History of Psychiatry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Psychiatry?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1430190, "name": "Race and Ethnicity In Mental Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity_In_Mental_Health?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 28649401, "title": "Legally Indian: Inquisitorial Readings of Indigenous Identities in New Spain", "created_at": "2016-09-21T14:35:10.862-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28649401/Legally_Indian_Inquisitorial_Readings_of_Indigenous_Identities_in_New_Spain?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_28649401", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61649337, "asset_id": 28649401, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 300785, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Tav\u00e1rez", "domain_name": "vassar", "page_name": "DavidTavarez", "display_name": "David  Tav\u00e1rez", "profile_url": "https://vassar.academia.edu/DavidTavarez?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/300785/60783/36156190/s65_david.tav_rez.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 294, "name": "Ethnic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 379, "name": "African Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3772, "name": "Legal History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Legal_History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3870, "name": "African Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 45246, "name": "Colonial Latin American History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Latin_American_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 84793, "name": "New Spain", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Spain?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 204902, "name": "Castas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Castas?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1303074, "name": "Indigenous Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Identity?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 33642852, "title": "Democracy and diversity: teaching for human rights and citizenship in post-conflict Iraqi Kurdistan", "created_at": "2017-06-25T05:56:28.887-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33642852/Democracy_and_diversity_teaching_for_human_rights_and_citizenship_in_post_conflict_Iraqi_Kurdistan?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_33642852", "summary": "In this article we report on INTERDEMOCRATE\n(intercultural and democratic learning in\nteacher education), a small scale research and\ndevelopment initiative in the autonomous\nregion of Iraqi Kurdistan.1 The project aimed to\naddress children\u2019s rights and education for\ndemocratic citizenship (EDC).

In this scheme the Jews presented a special problem, for most anthropologists assumed them to be racially pure and yet they looked like the majority populations wherever they lived. Thus, despite their small numbers, and despite the fact that anthropologists devoted more time to colonial subjects, almost all race scientists had something to say about the racial origins of the Jews and about how this question spoke to broader anthropological concerns.

Next, I explain the ways in which it makes more sense to see justice as evolving, rather than as fixed. Finally, I demonstrate the value of Charles Sanders Peirce\u2019s concept of a regulative ideal for framing a pragmatist outlook on justice. Peirce helps us at the same time to appreciate ideals yet to let go of outmoded understandings of their metaphysical status. Ideals are thus tools for regulating behavior.

The significant number of migrants to New Zealand of Asian and Middle Eastern ancestries has led to the development of rich and diverse ethnic enclaves. However, young people from these communities experience significant pressures to assimilate into western culture, which sometimes clash with parental desires to perpetuate cultural traditions. Drawing on 10 small group interviews conducted with 11 adolescent and 16 young adult female interviewees of Asian and Middle Eastern backgrounds in Auckland, New Zealand, this study examines how participants traverse culturally prescribed gender roles as they relate to intimate partner violence (IPV). Emergent themes from the study address participants' conceptualization of IPV, processes of learning IPV, and pressures to follow rigid gender-roles tied to IPV that are culturally embedded.

The EU seriously challenges the conventional treatment of minorities in Turkey. The Commission via its annual progress reports on Turkey, the Council via its summit decisions and the Parliament via oral and written questions addressed in the assembly emphasize the need for a better treatment of minorities in Turkey and call on Turkey to improve its human as well as minority rights records. From the Turkish perspective, there is no need for an immense reform since the Turkish Constitution and the Lausanne Treaty provides protection and equal treatment of non-Muslim minorities, which also allegedly satisfies the Copenhagen criteria for EU membership. The EU\u2019s pressure for the improvement of minority rights did not change this attitude and the Turkish state tries to satisfy the EU demands under the wider framework of changes in human rights and individual rights. In the Turkish context, the solution to minority rights is to handle them through improvements in three realms: elimination of discrimination, cultural rights and religious freedom. However, although reforms in these spheres point to an Europeanization process, they fall short of the spirit precluded in the Treaty of Lausanne and the Copenhagen criteria.\r\n",

European level. First, the author discusses the so-called \u2018Europeanization of Roma representation\u2019, that is the post-1989 representation of the Roma as a European minority and the simultaneous large-scale, Europe-wide devising of development, inclusion, and empowerment programs meant for them. Thereafter, the author argues that some of the risks of the Roma\u2019s Europeanization \u2013 such as the isolation and culturalization of policy formation and the diminishing of democratic accountability \u2013 have also and ambiguously affected Dutch policies meant for Roma, Sinti and caravan dwellers. By means of a brief analysis of recent policy developments, the author demonstrates that the Dutch shift towards a policy that, at least in name, encourages social participation, has actually tended to result into a one-sided focus on the Roma as a \u2018problem group\u2019 and \u2018security threat\u2019.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36621246, "asset_id": 9485525, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 15907435, "first_name": "Huub", "last_name": "van Baar", "domain_name": "kuleuven", "page_name": "HuubvanBaar", "display_name": "Huub van Baar", "profile_url": "https://kuleuven.academia.edu/HuubvanBaar?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/15907435/4305157/5003696/s65_huub.van_baar.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 383, "name": "European Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/European_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 941, "name": "Social Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Policy?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1118, "name": "Political Participation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Participation?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5535, "name": "Critical Security Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Security_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6831, "name": "Securitization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Securitization?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6942, "name": "Discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Discrimination?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 8471, "name": "Participation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Participation?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 9547, "name": "Minority Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 11866, "name": "Romani Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Romani_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 12420, "name": "Neoliberalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neoliberalism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 13430, "name": "Social Exclusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Exclusion?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 19707, "name": "Social Inclusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Inclusion?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 30160, "name": "Minority Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_Rights?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 37318, "name": "Public Policy -

"dom_id": "work_3330950", "summary": "Mixing facts and fiction, Hollywood screen biographies have told the lives of popular music icons at least since The Jazz Singer (1927). However, biopics construct narratives that deal problematically with issues of race. This article aims to describe how representations of African American musicians have changed from 1970s \u2018black jazz biopics\u2019 (Gabbard 1996) to more recent films on rock, hip hop and rhythm \u2019n\u2019 blues acts. On one hand, I analyse the way 1970s music biopics constructed a peculiar new narrative about race and popularity. On the other hand, I show the extent to which films such as Tina (1993), Ray (2004) and Notorious (2009) have subtly modified the racialized distinctions of former biopics, placing black musicians within a cinematic mythology which historically had been reserved to white subjects. The shift from jazz to other music genres, thus, is related to significant changes in biopics\u2019 narratives and visual strategies. However, I argue that music biopics still deal with a distinctive notion of \u2018the popular\u2019 (Williams 1983), which frames blackness as otherness and whiteness (Dyer 1997) as just \u2018human nature\u2019.\r\n\r\n(first publication by Jazz Research Journal and Equinox)", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34359609, "asset_id": 3330950, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

"American individualist ideology facilitates structural injustice. Through an analysis of Alexis de Tocqueville on individualism, gender domination, and white supremacy in the United States, this essay explains why. The peculiar social cognition of the American individualist desensitizes him to structural injustice. To preserve his faith that his fate lies entirely in his own hands, he blinds himself to the ways social structure constrains personal freedom and independence; the individualist also construes the unjust benefits of social privilege (like those accompanying whiteness and maleness in Jacksonian America) as products of personal ingenuity and character. Democracy in America (1835/40) thus illuminates the elective affinity between American individualism and structural injustice.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35782491, "asset_id": 274415, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 142393, "first_name": "Jack", "last_name": "Turner", "domain_name": "washington", "page_name": "JackTurner", "display_name": "Jack  Turner", "profile_url": "https://washington.academia.edu/JackTurner?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/142393/37760/39338752/s65_jack.turner.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1696, "name": "Political Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23534, "name": "Individualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Individualism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 35664, "name": "Alexis de Tocqueville", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alexis_de_Tocqueville?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 466015, "title": "Beyond the Pale: The Blackbird Browser's Critical Reception", "created_at": "2011-03-07T04:06:41.560-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/466015/Beyond_the_Pale_The_Blackbird_Browsers_Critical_Reception?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_466015", "summary": "The browser has become part of our communicative infrastructure, invisible to our information literacy practices until a rupture occurs.

Noted for her ground- breaking departure from the predictable genre of \u201cethnic autobiography\u201d and her incisive gaze on French bourgeois banality, Slimani has emerged as something of a poster-girl for post-racial society \u2013 a vocal proponent of Republican ideals such as freedom and equality and the \u201cborderless\u201d world of Francophone literature, Slimani appears to embody French \u201cuniversalisme.\u201d Yet, as Joan Wallach-Scott observes, such a concept is itself rooted in a very particular history of French nationalism and imperialism, whereby (especially Arabo-Muslim) societies cast as \u201canti-freedom\u201d or \u201canti-equality\u201d emerge not just as \u201canti-French,\u201d but \u201canti- human\u201d \u2013 even as this rhetoric is effectively deracialised.\nThis paper analyses the effects of de/racialisation and the negotiation of French racial/cultural anxieties in Slimani\u2019s celebrated killer-nanny novel, Chanson douce [Lullaby]. Working from Sara Ahmed\u2019s notion of racial dis/orientation in Queer Phenomenology, I ask to what extent the invisibilisation of race in the novel functions as a critique of \u201cwhite space,\u201d denaturalising the racial dynamics ordinarily concealed by universalist rhetoric, and as a mode of strategic assimilation on the part of the author herself \u2013 How does Slimani\u2019s ability to \u201cpass\u201d expose \u201cpassing\u201d as a technology of the State? And to what extent does the French public\u2019s delight at her \u201cpassing\u201d point to its own inability to get \u201cpast\u201d race?", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 296128, "first_name": "Keziah", "last_name": "Poole", "domain_name": "usc", "page_name": "KeziahPoole", "display_name": "Keziah Poole", "profile_url": "https://usc.academia.edu/KeziahPoole?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/296128/73031/1031113/s65_keziah.poole.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16329, "name": "Francophonie", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Francophonie?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48237, "name": "Passing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Passing?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54716, "name": "Moroccan Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Moroccan_Literature?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 125222, "name": "Universalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Universalism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 976359, "name": "French Republicanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_Republicanism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 993389, "name": "French Immigrants", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_Immigrants?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 2565446, "name": "Leila Slimani", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Leila_Slimani?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 11945090, "title": "Grounds for Difference (Harvard University Press, 2015)", "created_at": "2015-04-14T10:27:12.902-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11945090/Grounds_for_Difference_Harvard_University_Press_2015_?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_11945090", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4292051, "first_name": "Rogers", "last_name": "Brubaker", "domain_name": "ucla", "page_name": "RogersBrubaker", "display_name": "Rogers Brubaker", "profile_url": "https://ucla.academia.edu/RogersBrubaker?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4292051/1711532/2052261/s65_rogers.brubaker.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46644, "name": "Social Inequality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Inequality?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 78072511, "title": "Racial Battle Fatigue: The Long-Term Effects of Racial Microaggressions on African American Boys and Men", "created_at": "2022-04-30T13:53:45.161-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/78072511/Racial_Battle_Fatigue_The_Long_Term_Effects_of_Racial_Microaggressions_on_African_American_Boys_and_Men?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_78072511", "summary": "What is at stake, here, is the quest for equilibrium versus disequilibrium in a society that marginalizes human beings into substandard racial groups. Identifying and counteracting the biopsychosocial and behavioral consequences of actual or perceived racism, gendered racism, and racial battle fatigue is a premier challenge of the twenty-first century. The term \u201cracial microaggressions\u201d was introduced in the 1970s to help psychiatrists and psychologists understand the enormity and complications of the subtle but constant racial blows faced by African Americans. Today, racial microaggressions continue to contribute to the negative experiences of African American boys and men in schools, at work, and in society. This chapter will focus on the definition, identification, and long-term effects of racial microaggressions and the resultant racial battle fatigue in anti-black misandric environments.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 53311347, "first_name": "Glory", "last_name": "Stanton", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "GloryStanton", "display_name": "Glory Stanton", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/GloryStanton?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/53311347/34950600/30507980/s65_glory.stanton.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 296, "name": "Black Studies Or African American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Studies_Or_African_American_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1492, "name": "Racial and Ethnic Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_and_Ethnic_Politics?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2432, "name": "Critical Race Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 9756, "name": "Racial Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_Identity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 10006, "name": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_and_Racial_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14912, "name": "African American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_American_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 18677, "name": "Race and Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Schooling?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 18679, "name": "African American Males and Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_American_Males_and_Education?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 27879, "name": "Racial and ethnic discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_and_ethnic_discrimination?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 73888, "name": "Racial Microaggressions and Health Disparities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_Microaggressions_and_Health_Disparities?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 255242, "name": "African and African American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_and_African_American_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 625322, "name": "Black Boys", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Boys?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 660191, "name": "Racial Battle Fatigue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_Battle_Fatigue?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 736168, "name": "Racial Microaggressions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_Microaggressions?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 957019, "name": "Sociology of Ethnicity and Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Ethnicity_and_Race?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1288280, "name": "Black men and boys", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_men_and_boys?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 76995652, "title": "Chinatown unbound: trans-Asian urbanism in the age of China", "created_at": "2022-04-19T14:19:49.015-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/76995652/Chinatown_unbound_trans_Asian_urbanism_in_the_age_of_China?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_76995652", "summary": "Chinatown, as a distinctive urban space, exists in almost all major cities in Western countries.

One critical site for working out the parameters of this relationship was the classroom. Beginning in earnest in the 1880s, German elementary and secondary school students began to wrestle with the non-European world in a variety of disciplines, first and foremost in geography. Lessons on the colonial world encouraged young Germans to see themselves as an important part of an international struggle for strength and prosperity, one in which Germany needed to find, maintain, and even expand its own \u201cplace in the sun.\u201d According to this worldview, efficient, civilized nations were bound to intervene and direct the affairs of less efficient peoples for the good of all humanity. Young Germans did not only learn about their own colonial possessions, although these became more prominent as a result of wars in China and Africa. Students also studied those other areas of the world \u201ccolonized\u201d by the German public imagination and by German economic interests as well as those regions under the sway of other European and North American powers. \r\n\r\nThese lessons conveyed useful information and patriotic virtues; at the same time, they were used to encourage students\u2019 interest through the obvious appeal of the unfamiliar and adventurous. This contribution examines the institutionalization of colonial education as much more than mere colonialist propaganda. Instead I will situate this development within broader trends in pedagogical reform and mass leisure. Empire occupied and maintained a central place within German curricula during the Wilhelmine period because it could be put to use in ways that satisfied, on the one hand, the demands of teachers for engaging and illustrative material and, on the other, the demands of authorities for practical lessons for developing citizens capable of promoting Germany\u2019s well-being around the globe.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 56307, "first_name": "Jeff", "last_name": "Bowersox", "domain_name": "ucl", "page_name": "JeffBowersox", "display_name": "Jeff Bowersox", "profile_url": "https://ucl.academia.edu/JeffBowersox?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/56307/16670/15529/s65_jeff.bowersox.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 136, "name": "Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 384, "name": "German Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1729, "name": "German History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2196, "name": "History of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Education?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4616, "name": "Education History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 18727, "name": "History of Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Imperialism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 27810, "name": "Kaiserreich", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kaiserreich?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 30010, "name": "Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Empire?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 38974469, "title": "Race, Again.

whether face recognition technology - as it is intensely employed by state and local police departments and law enforcement agencies - is racism-free or, on the contrary, is affected by racial biases and/or racist prejudices, thus reinforcing overall racial discrimination.\n\nDesign/Methodology/Approach: The study investigates the causal pathways through which face recognition technology may reinforce the racial disproportion in enforcement; it also inquires whether it further discriminates black people by making them experience more racial discrimination, and self-identify more decisively as black - two conditions that are shown to be harmful in various respects.\n\nFindings: This study shows that face recognition technology, as it is produced, implemented and used in Western societies, reinforces existing racial disparities in stop, investigation, arrest and incarceration rates due to racist prejudices, and even contributes to strengthen the unhealthy effects of racism on historically disadvantaged racial groups, like black people.\n\nPractical implications: The findings hope to make law enforcement agencies and software companies aware that they must take adequate action against the racially discriminative effects of the use of face recognition technology.\n\nSocial implications: This paper highlights that no implementation of an allegedly racism-free biometric technology is safe from the risk of racially discriminating, simply because each implementation leans against our society, which is affected by racism in many persisting ways.\n\nOriginality/Value: While the ethical survey of biometric technologies is traditionally framed in the discourse of universal rights, this study explores an issue that has not been deeply scrutinised so far, that is, how face recognition technology differently affects distinct racial groups, and how it contributes to racial discrimination.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

This larger discussion frames a narrower conversation on the continuities and discontinuities of systems of sacrifice from slavery to our modern prison industrial complex. More trenchantly, I examine the relationship between the cross and carcerality through Jesus' proximity to criminality. I argue that by entering into history through a criminalized body, Jesus' life, ministry and death demonstrates his proximity to and solidarity with those who are criminalized - including the first Christian community who had a 'criminal element,' Jesus' ministerial purpose to \"set the captives free,\" his instructions for discipleship to visit the 'least of these' who are imprisoned, to extending reconciliation to a 'penitent thief' and being surveilled and persecuted by a State sanctioned execution. In the end, by tracing a kind of christological three-day event of criminality, I argue that Jesus died a criminal but did not wake up one. On the cross Jesus transcends criminality through the resurrection, which gives hope for liberation over and against carceral systems of sacrifice.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58726520, "asset_id": 38648000, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 57508169, "first_name": "Nikia", "last_name": "Robert, PhD", "domain_name": "cst", "page_name": "NikiaRobert", "display_name": "Nikia Robert, PhD", "profile_url": "https://cst.academia.edu/NikiaRobert?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/57508169/15088247/15802740/s65_nikia.robert.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 296, "name": "Black Studies Or African American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Studies_Or_African_American_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 537, "name": "Criminal Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminal_Justice?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 814, "name": "Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethics?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5338, "name": "Liberation Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liberation_Theology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5342, "name": "Black Liberation Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Liberation_Theology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5792, "name": "Social Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Justice?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6108, "name": "Womanist Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womanist_Theology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 9488, "name": "Restorative Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Restorative_Justice?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 10191, "name": "Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Justice?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14413, "name": "Womanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womanism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 15850, "name": "Prison Industrial Complex", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prison_Industrial_Complex?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 34918, "name": "Christian Social Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christian_Social_Ethics?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 39673, "name": "Feminism and Social Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminism_and_Social_Justice?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 57214, "name": "Mass Incarceration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mass_Incarceration?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 187180, "name": "Criminal Justice System", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminal_Justice_System?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 255791, "name": "Criminology and Criminal Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminology_and_Criminal_Justice?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 480396, "name": "Critical Carceral Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Carceral_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 508065, "name": "Carceral state", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Carceral_state?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 22898755, "title": "Cultural Code: Video Games and Latin America (MIT Press, 2016)", "created_at": "2016-03-06T18:22:12.951-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/22898755/Cultural_Code_Video_Games_and_Latin_America_MIT_Press_2016_?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_22898755", "summary": "Please see: https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/cultural-code\n\nPreview on Google Books: https://books.google.com/books/about/Cultural_Code.html?id=xlOPjgEACAAJ\n\nPurchase hardcover on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Cultural-Code-Video-Games-America/dp/0262034050/\n\nPurchase eBook (readable on Kindle using app): https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/cultural-code\n\nVideo games are becoming an ever more ubiquitous element of daily life, played by millions on devices that range from smart phones to desktop computers. An examination of this phenomenon reveals that video games are increasingly being converted into cultural currency for a variety of purposes across the globe. For video game designers, culture is a resource that can be incorporated into games; for players, local gaming practices and specific social contexts can affect their playing experiences. In Cultural Code, Phillip Penix-Tadsen shows how culture uses games and how games use culture, looking at examples related to Latin America. Both static code and subjective play have been shown to contribute to the meaning of games; Penix-Tadsen introduces culture as a third level of creating meaning. \n\nPenix-Tadsen focuses first on how culture uses games, looking at the diverse practices of play in Latin America, the ideological and intellectual uses of games, and the creative and economic possibilities opened up by video games in Latin America\u2014the evolution of regional game design and development. Examining how games use culture, Penix-Tadsen discusses in-game cultural representations of Latin America in a range of popular titles (pointing out, for example, appearances of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Christ the Redeemer statue in games from Call of Duty to the tourism-promoting Brasil Quest). He analyzes this through semiotics, the signifying systems of video games and the specific signifiers of Latin American culture; space, how culture is incorporated into different types of game environments; and simulation, the ways that cultural meaning is conveyed procedurally and algorithmically through gameplay mechanics.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nIntroduction: Toward a Cultural Ludology\n\nPart I:

Esta \u00e9 a segunda publica\u00e7\u00e3o realizada sob os ausp\u00edcios do projeto PROCAD \"Ra\u00e7a, Etnicidade, Sexualidade e G\u00eanero em Perspectiva Comparada\", uma proposta de coopera\u00e7\u00e3o acad\u00eamica fi nanciada pela CAPES, que se estendeu por cinco anos, entre 2008 e 2013, envolvendo o Programa de P\u00f3s-Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o em Antro-pologia Social da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo e o Programa de P\u00f3s-Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o em Antropologia da Universidade Federal do Par\u00e1. A meta conjunta do projeto era explorar classifi ca\u00e7\u00f5es sociais de cor, ra\u00e7a, etnia, g\u00eanero e sexualidade em diferentes contextos, tomando-as como categorias articuladas e mutuamente constitu\u00eddas na confi gura\u00e7\u00e3o de diferen-\u00e7as, discrimina\u00e7\u00f5es e desigualdades. Sua realiza\u00e7\u00e3o foi concomitante \u00e0 formula-\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de pesquisa de marcadores sociais da diferen\u00e7a no Programa de P\u00f3s-Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o em Antropologia Social da USP, com a consequente cria\u00e7\u00e3o do NUMAS-N\u00facleo de Estudos dos Mar-cadores Sociais da Diferen\u00e7a. Esta colet\u00e2nea re\u00fane e amplia as con-tribui\u00e7\u00f5es baseadas no tratamento de uma variada e complexa especifi ca\u00e7\u00e3o de problemas sociais e de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o antropol\u00f3gica envolvendo uma mul-tiplicidade de sujeitos e nomea\u00e7\u00f5es referidas a diferencia\u00e7\u00f5es e classifi ca\u00e7\u00f5es de g\u00eanero, sexualidade, ra\u00e7a, classe-mas tamb\u00e9m idade, regionalidade, nacionalidade e v\u00e1rios aspectos relacio-nados a apar\u00eancia, forma, tamanho e funcionalidades corporais. \u00c9 resultado do trabalho de forma\u00e7\u00e3o e amadurecimento de jovens pesquisadores no NUMAS, em di\u00e1logo com refer\u00eancias que se valem de aportes cl\u00e1ssicos da antropologia, enri-quecidos por abordagens e compreens\u00f5es provenientes dos estudos de g\u00eanero e sexualidade, do pensamento feminista e da refl ex\u00e3o sobre ra\u00e7a e etnicidade, dentre outras fontes de inspira\u00e7\u00e3o. No conjunto, constitui um esfor\u00e7o renovado para consolidar a tem\u00e1tica dos marca-dores sociais da diferen\u00e7a no campo da antropologia no Brasil. 9 788578 162160 ISBN 978-85-7816-216-0

", a towering figure of world literature, has been directly involved with the racial and cultural struggle of South Africa, South Africa as a country condenses, many major problems facing the world today, that of class, race and culture. As a writer, living in the world that she depicts in her novels, she is like an \u2017inside observer' who presents an 'inside history', of the lives and people of South Africa going through the transient phases of political upheavals. The political, social and literary situations prepared her mind to write against the exploitation and cruel policies of white rulers. We can say that there was something in her blood which revolted her against the white laws which segregated the blacks from white and made the native homeless in their own homeland. She is a member of the White oppressor class in South Africa and yet carries a conscientious commitment against apartheid. She is a white in a majority population of the blacks, and within the whites, she happens to be a white liberal. As she writes: \u2015Our skin colour labelled us as oppressors to the blacks and our views labelled us as traitors to the whites.\u2016 (Stephen Clingman, 3) The purpose behind apartheid, was to achieve as much social separation as possible. In industry in 1926, legislature reserved skilled jobs for whites only, in order to ensure employment for them. All social and physical contact between the two races was prohibited. Not only was miscegenation-mixed marriages between the two races prohibited, under the excuse of preserving the \u2017purity of race' but even the slightest physical contact was banned. There was segregation in sports and race; even in baths, cinemas, restaurants, beaches and educational institutions. The only permissible African contact was of the servant-and the master, which could provide the white with all intimate services by the blacks like cooking, nursing, washing and waiting at tables. Besides that, even the educated African, though much less in number could not be treated at par by the whites. The most abhorred and resented form of apartheid was probably the pass laws. Laws, that remind the black man that almost everywhere he travels, race prejudice will not let him be at home in the world. It required Africans to carry a permit to enter and work in a white area for a maximum stay of seventy two hours. A failure to produce these papers meant imprisonment. These pass laws were meant to restrict the movement of natives, but were instead a bitter stamp of inferiority imprinted on the Africans.

ABSTRACT This paper presents a discussion of the role that the black women played in the post-abolition. The reason is because the history of black men-even more the black women-, is a subject little explored by researchers about this period, showing the necessity of a refined study on various aspects of the history from the perspective of the black men and the black women. Added to it the association that is made between their stories and the slavery. This is because, with the advent of the First Republic, in a context marked by post-abolition, the main focus, these individuals become secondary, and also are denied to then the paper of \" producer of a specific story. \" If there are few studies related to race in this historical period, when added to gender, the connections between these two categories are uncommon. Therefore, our attempt is to bring elements about the role which black women exercised in the past, and that somehow, is present is today.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53022687, "asset_id":

few places where mobility has shaped identity as widely as the American West, but some locations and populations sit at its major crossroads, maintaining control over place and mobility, labor and race. In Collisions at the Crossroads, Genevieve Carpio argues that mobility, both permission to move freely and prohibitions on movement, helped shape racial formation in the eastern suburbs of Los Angeles and the Inland Empire throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. By examining policies and forces as different as historical societies, Indian boarding schools, bicycle ordinances, immigration policy, incarceration, traffic checkpoints, and Route 66 heritage, she shows how local authorities constructed a racial hierarchy by allowing some people to move freely while placing limits on the mobility of others. Highlighting the ways people of color have negotiated their place within these systems, Carpio reveals a compelling and perceptive analysis of spatial mobility through physical movement and residence.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58719025, "asset_id": 38640955, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 818818, "first_name": "Genevieve", "last_name": "Carpio", "domain_name": "ucla", "page_name": "GenevieveCarpio", "display_name": "Genevieve Carpio", "profile_url": "https://ucla.academia.edu/GenevieveCarpio?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/818818/292268/23093663/s65_genevieve.carpio.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 297, "name": "Chicano Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chicano_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 298, "name": "Latino/A Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latino_A_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 390, "name": "American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2409, "name": "Mobility/Mobilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Mobilities?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3209, "name": "Suburban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Suburban_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3410, "name": "Urban History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3764, "name": "Asian American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_American_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4808, "name": "Urban Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Planning?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 8375, "name": "American West", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_West?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 13006, "name": "Immigration History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration_History?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14912, "name": "African American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_American_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 22920, "name": "Automobile", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Automobile?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 25166, "name": "20th Century", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/20th_Century?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 26743, "name": "Intersectionality and Social Inequality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality_and_Social_Inequality?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 50113, "name": "California", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/California?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 107550, "name": "Settler colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_colonialism?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 1919262, "title": "The People, Rhetoric, and Affect: On the Political Force of Du Bois' The Souls of Black Folk", "created_at": "2012-09-08T13:20:23.810-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1919262/The_People_Rhetoric_and_Affect_On_the_Political_Force_of_Du_Bois_The_Souls_of_Black_Folk?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_1919262", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 27524299, "asset_id": 1919262, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2463563, "first_name": "Melvin", "last_name": "Rogers", "domain_name": "brown", "page_name": "MelvinRogers", "display_name": "Melvin Rogers", "profile_url": "https://brown.academia.edu/MelvinRogers?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2463563/770945/84565115/s65_melvin.rogers.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 953, "name": "Rhetoric", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rhetoric?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2933, "name": "Democratic Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democratic_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6729, "name": "Philosophy of the Emotions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_the_Emotions?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13287, "name": "American Political Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Political_Thought?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 69172, "name": "W.

Jones Award & William E. Brigman Award for Outstanding Graduate Paper.\r\nAbstract: Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thomson\u2019s 1934 production of Four Saints in Three Acts, \u201can opera to be sung,\u201d  is unique in its collaborative features and U.S. sociohistorical positioning: text by a Paris-based American writer (Stein), costumes designed by a painter (Florine Stettheimer), choreography determined by a British ballet director (Frederick Ashton), and a cast of all African-American performers. Though Thomson describes the texts\u2019 themes as \u201c\u2019religious life\u2014peace between the sexes, community of faith, the production of miracles\u2019\u201d (Weber 217), the language and performance of this specific event, and the implications of which, prevent such a general theme from emerging. Instead, constructions of blackness through the early-20th-century performing body are at the forefront. When undergirded by Steinien language, the intricacies between language and performance as related to history, time, and race work to negate the \u2018religious life\u2019 theme and instead make palpable the early-20th-century U.S. moment. In particular, Four Saints enacts Stein\u2019s \u2018continuous present\u2019 conception of time, speech, and action (\u201cComposition\u201d 5), which introduces the questioning of the degrees to which a temporal construct can impact elements of a performance. As a result, this project is an investigation of the relationships between Stein\u2019s specific temporal-historical lens, the collaborative features of the opera\u2019s production, and the text\u2019s early-20th-century sociohistorical positioning.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62163984, "asset_id": 42037328, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 18406996, "first_name": "Jocelyn E.", "last_name": "Marshall", "domain_name": "emerson", "page_name": "JocelynEMarshall", "display_name": "Jocelyn E.

The emergent conflicts between Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese migrants overlap with the duality of time or differing time-inflected cultural habits of Mainlanders and Hong Kongers. As Hong Kong's citizenry and Mainlanders contest the status of the former colony and claim rights over it in ways aberrant to both factions' national consciousness, discrimination increases as Mainlanders are castigated by Hong Kongers for grazing their territory with mannerisms deemed unsettling to Hong Kong's everyday notions of time and space.

In other words, a reasonably sized nation of prisoners.\r\n\r\nThis is also the largest prison population on Earth.  No other country comes close. On any given day, the United States, with 5% of the world\u2019s population, has close to 25% of the people imprisoned on the planet.  That population, by the way, has risen by 700% since 1970, a tidal movement for incarceration that only in recent years has shown small signs of finally ebbing. In short, state by state or as a country, the U.S. leaves the rest of the world in the dust.

For advocates of code-switching, teaching students to distinguish between \u201chome language\u201d and \u201cschool language\u201d offers a solution to the tug-of-war between standard and nonstandard Englishes. This volume arises from concerns that this kind of code-switching may actually facilitate the illiteracy and academic failure that educators seek to eliminate and can promote resistance to Standard English rather than encouraging its use.\r\n\r\nThe original essays in this collection offer various perspectives on why code-meshing\u2014blending minoritized dialects and world Englishes with Standard English\u2014is a better pedagogical alternative than code-switching in the teaching of reading, writing, listening, speaking, and visually representing to diverse learners. This collection argues that code-meshing rather than code-switching leads to lucid, often dynamic prose by people whose first language is something other than English, as well as by native English speakers who speak and write with \u201caccents\u201d and those whose home language or neighborhood dialects are deemed \u201cnonstandard.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile acknowledging the difficulties in implementing a code-meshing pedagogy, editors Vershawn Ashanti Young and Aja Y. Martinez, along with a range of scholars from international and national literacy studies, English education, writing studies, sociolinguistics, and critical pedagogy, argue that all writers and speakers benefit when we demystify academic language and encourage students to explore the plurality of the English language in both unofficial and official spaces.\r\n\r\nContributors: Julie Anne Naviaux; Rosina Lippi Green; Frankie Condon; Gerald Graff; Theresa Malphrus Welford; David A.

However, conducting research on race and criminal justice in Canada is difficult given the lack of readily available data that include information about race.2 We show that data on the race of victims and accused persons are being suppressed by police organizations in Canada and argue that suppression of race prevents quantitative anti-racism research while not preventing the use of these data by the police for racial profiling. We also argue that when powerful institutions, such as the police, have knowledge that they keep secret or refuse to discover, it serves the interests of those institutions at the expense of the public. Fears that reporting of racial data will result in racial profiling or the stigmatization of racialized communities are not assuaged by the repression of this information. Stigmatization may still occur, and racial profiling can continue to happen, but without public knowledge. Quantitative anti-racist research requires consistent, institutionalized reporting of race data through all aspects of Canadian justice. We outline what data are available, what data are needed, and where consistency is lacking.

The banality of this question should not excuse what are arguably serious limitations. Rather than using an adjective (i.e., what), it may be more sociologically productive to use a determiner (e.g., whose). Asking \"Whose time is it?\" alludes to the inherent power relations associated with time that privilege some at the expense of others. In reframing the question, we open possibilities to appreciate the way time is experienced differently between individuals and groups. Investigating the different dimensions of power associated with time also reveals how individuals and groups are rendered legible, illegible, and/or nonexistent within conventional temporal terms. As an application of 770469S REXXX10.1177/2332649218770469Sociology of Race and EthnicityMahadeo research-article2018 Abstract Independently, the study of whiteness and the study of time are important interventions in sociology. A solid foundation for any empirical investigation of the relationship between whiteness and the racialized temporalities of racialized youth, however, has yet to be set. Drawing on data from 30 in-person interviews and ethnographic methods, the author explores how racialized youth interpret time in relation to whiteness and the experiences of white youth. The data for this research are based on more than one year of fieldwork at Run-aWay , a multiservice center for youth. Results show that racialized youth view white youth as having more time to take advantage of educational and employment opportunities. As a result of the perceived temporal advantage held by their white counterparts, racialized youth expressed feelings of temporal inequality and disparate life chances. Forced to work twice as hard to be half as good, youth saw their time horizons as compressed. The author shows how racialized youth lose time through physical, psychic, and emotional labor required to process racialization and racism and illustrates the various structural mechanisms that steal their time. Despite the temporal inequalities between them and their white counterparts, youth at Run-aWay discovered ways to invert the terms of temporality to ensure that their culture was always most relevant and \"up to date.\" Although whiteness is linked to modernity and that which is future oriented, racialized youth viewed their white counterparts as behind time, lame, or just plain \"wack\" (uncool).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58705024, "asset_id": 38627617, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2802948, "first_name": "Rahsaan", "last_name": "Mahadeo", "domain_name": "providence", "page_name": "RahsaanMahadeo", "display_name": "Rahsaan Mahadeo", "profile_url": "https://providence.academia.edu/RahsaanMahadeo?f_ri=5453", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1557, "name": "Youth Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 125925, "name": "Whiteness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Whiteness?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 621517, "name": "Time", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Time-2?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 33576739, "title": "Hey Girl am I More than my Hair?: African American Women and their Struggles with Beauty, Body Image and Hair", "created_at": "2017-06-20T14:10:41.919-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33576739/Hey_Girl_am_I_More_than_my_Hair_African_American_Women_and_their_Struggles_with_Beauty_Body_Image_and_Hair?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_33576739", "summary": "National Women\u2019s Studies Association Journal, 2006, 18(2), 24-51\nUsing Afrocentric theory and standpoint theory, this article examines the effect of the White standard of beauty upon African American women.

To illustrate the scholarly significance of BTFT, I draw upon the ontological invalidation of black trans lives in the #BlackLivesMatter movement. #BlackLivesMatter is situated as (1) an exemplar of how black transgender women are commonly excluded from activist discourses, and (2) an opportunity to theorize the utility of BTFT as it relates to racialized gender variant lives and deaths.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49532086, "asset_id": 29003118, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4777002, "first_name": "Marquis", "last_name": "Bey", "domain_name": "northwestern", "page_name": "MarquisBey", "display_name": "Marquis Bey", "profile_url": "https://northwestern.academia.edu/MarquisBey?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4777002/2031257/91484157/s65_marquis.bey.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2624, "name": "Transgender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transgender_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 12093, "name": "Theories of Gender and Transgender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theories_of_Gender_and_Transgender?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14412, "name": "Black feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_feminism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 26798, "name": "Transgender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transgender?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1901957, "name": "Black Lives Matter", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Lives_Matter?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 50909112, "title": "Muslim Marginalization in India: From Ethnic Conflict Perspective", "created_at": "2021-08-17T05:36:14.732-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/50909112/Muslim_Marginalization_in_India_From_Ethnic_Conflict_Perspective?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_50909112", "summary": "With BJP arrival to power, secular face of India has received severe criticism in international community.

"Discourse concerning religion in the American public sphere exists within what Miller (2012) describes as church decline narratives. Highlighting the declining significance of organized religion, these narratives conform neatly with notions of young adults\u2019 relationships to formal authority broadly speaking and religious institutions in particular. However, the declining significance of institutionalized religion manifests itself differently in the lives of Black young adults living in the United States compared with White young adults. For example, according to the 2014 Religious Landscape Survey, younger Black millennials (20\u201326 years old) were less likely than younger White millennials to identify as religiously unaffiliated (29% vs. 38%; Pew Research Center, 2014). In light of this, how do we understand religion in the lives of college students? What are the implications of the fact that despite increasing religious disaffiliation, 90% of younger Black millennials are either absolutely or fairly certain about their belief in God? In this paper, I propose a theorization of religion\u2019s afterlife\u2014or how religion continues to matter in Black students\u2019 lives despite their lack of affiliation and engagement with institutionalized faith organizations. I offer a critical account of religion as a socially constructed category that exerts influence in the lives of Black undergraduates beyond institutional boundaries and religious-specific spaces. These findings emphasize the necessity for educators to provide greater attention to spirituality and religion as critical components of institutions\u2019 diversity agendas in general and how religion and spirituality play out in the lives of Black undergraduates at PWIs in particular.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52292266, "asset_id": 32028455, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 41310151, "first_name": "Keon", "last_name": "McGuire", "domain_name": "asu", "page_name": "KeonMcGuire", "display_name": "Keon M McGuire", "profile_url": "https://asu.academia.edu/KeonMcGuire?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/41310151/12271609/13664137/s65_keon.mcguire.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25696, "name": "College student development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/College_student_development?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 16199830, "title": "Microaggressions and the Multiracial Experience", "created_at": "2015-09-26T08:45:30.292-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/16199830/Microaggressions_and_the_Multiracial_Experience?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_16199830", "summary": "\u00a9 Centre for Promoting Ideas, USA www.ijhssnet.com ...

Sixteen Ain\u2019t So Sweet: Longitudinal Study of Jasper Texas. Journal of the American Studies Association of Texas (45).\n  \nSixteen Ain\u2019t So Sweet: Jasper Dragging Longitudinal Study\nBy\nCassy Burleson, Baylor University\nMia Moody-Ramirez, Baylor University\n \nAbstract\nThis 16-year study uses Critical Race Theory to examine how people connected to Jasper, Texas, view the long-lasting effects of the 1998 murder of James Byrd, Jr., and recent events there that include turmoil related to the suspicious death of a young Black family man. This study places Jasper residents at the core and examines the subject within the nexus of race, population, politics, and economics. In-depth, interpretive analysis is a precise tool useful in evaluating historical events when the goal is exploration of respondents\u2019 points of view, feelings, and perspectives. Our findings indicate Jasper residents reached \u201cinterest convergence\u201d four times: immediately following the Byrd murder in 1998 and during the three subsequent trials in 1999, after the Columbia space shuttle exploded over Jasper in 2003, and during Hurricane Rita\u2019s aftermath in 2005. However, one murderer\u2019s execution and three racially charged crises from 2011 on, coupled with the absence of a strong leadership team to inspire community cohesiveness, have reopened wounds and resulted in a more pronounced racial divide 16 years later than existed prior to the Byrd murder in 1998.\n \nKeywords: race, framing, James Byrd, Jr.; interest convergence; critical race theory; Jasper, Texas\n \nAcknowledgements: We wish to thank graduate assistants, Danielle Kilgo and Tonya B.

That this took place not long after ideologies of mestizaje or racial mixing had been elaborated by nationalist scholars and disseminated through literature, film, art, and music can be no coincidence, since the links between racial and national ideologies are well known. Yet to date, the important role dance has played in constructing Latin American nations and disseminating particular racial ideologies has been little examined. This chapter focuses on the Ballet Folklorico de Mexico, one of the earliest formed and most successful of the folklorico dance companies, and its founder, Amalia Hernandez. The group has been extremely influential in the arena of folkloric dance, prompting changes in the performance of local Mexican dance traditions and inspiring the creation of numerous regional companies both in Mexico and among Chicanos in the US. An analysis of filmed performances of the national Ballet Folklorico and regional companies along with the Ballet\u2019s program notes, press materials, and reviews will reveal the specific image of Mexico the company promoted and popularized both at home and abroad and the role it played in the mass commodification of Mexican folklore.

real-world racial and ethnic beliefs. This research used a survey design to assess the relationship between White college students\u2019 frequency of video game play and attitudes toward Blacks and Asians. Results suggest that video game play cultivates real-world beliefs about Blacks, such that individuals who spend more time playing video games have less egalitarian views of Blacks. Interracial contact was explored as a moderator but had no influence on the relationship between game play and stereotyping. Results are discussed from a cultivation theory as well as a social identity theory perspective.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33451131, "asset_id": 6734450, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 66984, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Ta", "domain_name": "missouri", "page_name": "DavidT\u1ea1", "display_name": "David Ta", "profile_url": "https://missouri.academia.edu/DavidT%E1%BA%A1?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/66984/84392/3854783/s65_david.ta-pryor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5199, "name": "Video Games", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Video_Games?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 122652, "name": "Cultivation Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultivation_Theory?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 2329789, "title": "Global Linguistic Flows: Hip Hop Cultures, Youth Identities, and the Politics of Language - Edited by H.

Collected here for the first time, the poems printed in the newspapers bring to light a network of intimate connections and vibrant dialogue. In verse modeled on French Romantic poetry, more than twenty activist authors wrote poems back and forth to each other before a public audience. Differing in important ways from the tone of the newspapers\u2019 prose, the poetry expands our understanding of the close-knit, politically progressive community of Creole gens de couleur and recovers their contributions to the fight for civil rights in the United States. The original French poems appear here alongside Clint Bruce\u2019s sensitive English translations, mindful of meaning, meter, and sound. A comprehensive introduction, biographies of the poets, and extensive annotations immerse the reader in Civil War\u2013era Louisiana.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65301440, "asset_id":

Data for this study originated from The National LGBT Alumni Survey and included 386 QTPOC respondents. We utilized analysis of variance (ANOVA) to explore differences in outness across racial identities for QTPOC students and linear regression to understand the relationship between contextual influences and outness using Abes, Jones, and McEwen\u2019s (2007) reconceptualized model of multiple dimensions of identity as a framework.Wealsoanalyzedparticipants\u2019open-endedresponses to understand how QTPOC students navigate meaning making across their gender, racial, and sexual identities. The ANOVA was significant for outness, F(3, 382) = 6.93, p < .001, with a medium effectsize(\u019e2 =.05).Thelinearregressionanalysisexplained44% of the variance in outness among QTPOC student respondents (p < .001). Narratives from the open-ended responses offered additional perspectives and further informed how QTPOC students navigated and made meaning of their identity disclosures.

I demonstrate how drawing on a cultural class analysis and education literature on learner identities and performativity can be productive in theorising the continued significance of class, and indeed also race and gender in young people's lives. In examining school-based friendships and (sub)cultural forms through empirical research in urban schools, I argue that not only are young people's subcultural groups structured by class, race and gender but also they are integral to the production of these identities. By examining the discursive productions of two school-based subcultures as examples: the \u2018Smokers\u2019 and the \u2018Football\u2019 crowd, I further argue that these identity positions embody resources or capitals which have differing value in the context of the urban school and thus demonstrate how race, class and gender privilege are maintained and reproduced through youth subculture.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61397322, "asset_id": 41154447, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 125639, "first_name": "Sumi", "last_name": "Hollingworth", "domain_name": "ku", "page_name": "SumiHollingworth", "display_name": "Sumi Hollingworth", "profile_url": "https://ku.academia.edu/SumiHollingworth?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/125639/91876/100582/s65_sumi.hollingworth.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1557, "name": "Youth Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3351, "name": "Subcultures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subcultures?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8002, "name": "Youth Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_Culture?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 16742, "name": "Urban Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Sociology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 37408, "name": "Social Classes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Classes?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 25301142, "title": "African Futures: Essays on Crisis, Emergence and Possibility", "created_at": "2016-05-13T07:29:09.739-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/25301142/African_Futures_Essays_on_Crisis_Emergence_and_Possibility?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_25301142", "summary": "Civil wars, corporate exploitation, AIDS, and Ebola\u2014but also democracy, burgeoning cities, and unprecedented communication and mobility: the future of Africa has never been more uncertain. Indeed, that future is one of the most complex issues in contemporary anthropology, as evidenced by the incredible wealth of ideas offered in this landmark volume. A consortium comprised of some of the most important scholars of Africa today, this book surveys an intellectual landscape of opposed perspectives in order to think within the contradictions that characterize this central question: Where is Africa headed?\n           \nThe experts in this book address Africa\u2019s future as it is embedded within various social and cultural forms emerging on the continent today: the reconfiguration of the urban, the efflorescence of signs and wonders and gospels of prosperity, the assorted techniques of legality and illegality, lotteries and Ponzi schemes, apocalyptic visions, a yearning for exile, and many other phenomena. Bringing together social, political, religious, and economic viewpoints, the book reveals not one but multiple prospects for the future of Africa. In doing so, it offers a pathbreaking model of pluralistic and open-ended thinking and a powerful tool for addressing the vexing uncertainties that underlie so many futures around the world.

Modern is a riveting account of Brazil\u2019s emergence as a global leader in plastic surgery. Intrigued by a Carnaval parade that mysteriously paid homage to a Rio de Janeiro plastic surgeon, anthropologist Alexander Edmonds conducted research that took him from Ipanema socialite circles to glitzy telenovela studios to the packed waiting rooms of public hospitals offering free cosmetic surgery. The result is provocative exploration of the erotic, commercial, and intimate aspects of beauty in a nation with extremes of wealth and poverty and a reputation for natural sensuality. Drawing on conversations with maids and their elite mistresses, divorced housewives, black celebrities, and favela residents aspiring to be fashion models, Edmonds analyzes what sexual desirability means and does for women in different social positions. He argues that beauty is a distinct realm of modern experience that does not simply reflect other inequalities. It mimics the ambiguous emancipatory potential of capital, challenging traditional hierarchies while luring consumers into a sexual culture that reduces the body to the brute biological criteria of attractiveness. Illustrated with color photographs, Pretty Modern offers a fresh theoretical perspective on the significance of female beauty in consumer capitalism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 1899508, "asset_id": 365228, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 278916, "first_name": "Alexander (Alex)", "last_name": "Edmonds", "domain_name": "edinburgh", "page_name": "AlexanderAlexEdmonds", "display_name": "Alexander (Alex)  Edmonds", "profile_url": "https://edinburgh.academia.edu/AlexanderAlexEdmonds?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/278916/59241/11598575/s65_alexander_alex_.edmonds.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 651, "name": "Plastic Surgery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Plastic_Surgery?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 793, "name": "Medical Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medical_Anthropology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 975, "name": "Sex and Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sex_and_Gender?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3657, "name": "Anthropology of the Body", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_the_Body?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3827, "name": "Brazilian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brazilian_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 4920, "name": "Anthropology of Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Gender?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5254, "name": "Beauty Industry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Beauty_Industry?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5273, "name": "Class", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Class?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 9821, "name": "Brazil", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brazil?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 17108, "name": "Anthropology Of Consumption", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_Of_Consumption?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 23342, "name": "Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 63000712, "title": "The Rohingyas: Search for an identity and a home", "created_at": "2021-12-02T09:31:33.625-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/63000712/The_Rohingyas_Search_for_an_identity_and_a_home?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_63000712", "summary": "The Rohingyas have been described as one of the most discriminated ethnic communities across the globe.

hyperempathy syndrome constitutes a kind of new materialism avant la lettre, prefiguring problems we are perhaps only now in a position to address academically. In other words, if both current scientific and philosophical conceptions of life attest that beings are always already co-constituted by their surroundings, we can no longer rely on a model of subjectivity and personhood that presupposes clear, bounded individuation. Before the popularization of affect theory and new materialism, Octavia E. Butler\u2019s hyperempathy\u2014a condition causing possessors to have an embodied response to visual perception of others\u2019 emotions\u2014provides a speculation on the consequences of the felt, interconnectivity of beings that \u201csympoiesis\u201d characterizes. Against assumptions that interconnectivity necessarily precipitates more ethical modes of being in the world, Butler challenges static claims about shared substance and experience by providing a more complex depiction of what it means to feel as others do. I argue that Butler\u2019s presentation of hyperempathy demonstrates that sharing experience is not a panacea for human and non-human relations but a restaging of the politics of identification and institutional power on another dimension.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67436805, "asset_id": 43031286, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 69398401, "first_name": "Doug", "last_name": "Stark", "domain_name": "unc", "page_name": "DougStark", "display_name": "Doug Stark", "profile_url": "https://unc.academia.edu/DougStark?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/69398401/23603904/107749288/s65_doug.stark.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2260, "name": "Disability Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disability_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8694, "name": "Science Fiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_Fiction?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21498, "name": "Affect/Emotion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Emotion?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44423, "name": "Afrofuturism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Afrofuturism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 50238, "name": "Affect", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 52726, "name": "Octavia Butler", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Octavia_Butler?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 630891, "name": "Octavia E.

We investigate a previously unexamined downside of this recruitment strategy: diversity dishonesty, that is, belief that an organization is falsely or incorrectly inflating its actual diversity. In four studies (total N = 871), we found that diversity dishonesty heightened minorities\u2019 concerns about fitting in, being authentic, and performing well at the organization.

I analyze this salient but discernible architecture of racial tropes, perceptions, and continuities as a counterpoint to the popular myth of contemporary Africa as a place in which race is an unintelligible and invisible factor in social relations, a place in which the colonial work of race and racism purportedly expired with political independence. Using examples from across Africa, I argue that colonial racial signs have persisted in the postcolonial public space, inflecting elite aspirational cultures and marking social distinctions disguised with the language of class and culture. In addition, African elites and common folk alike have actively expanded and added to a vast, variegated system of socio-cultural valuation and devaluation that is rarely acknowledged as racial in origin or interpellation, and whose connections to contemporary transnational structures of racial privilege remain hidden beneath non-racial signifiers. Deploying the popular Anglophone African conversational idiom of \u201ccolonial mentality,\u201d which is often advanced to designate a range of practices, behaviors, and ways of seeing, acting, and conceptualizing the world, I contend that postcolonial Africa is saturated with numerous social idioms of race and racism.

Built on grounds of plausibility and consistency with existing narratives, racial hoaxes may remain latent for a long time, and periodically emerge when negative stereotypes can be framed as actual news stories. Racial hoaxes have relevant political and social implications: spread across multiple channels, they can foster exclusionary discourse on immigration, migrants , refugees, and other minorities, with concrete consequences on people and policies. In particular, far-right movements embrace hoaxes as a great opportunity to advocate their claims and legitimate their calls for violent action. Theoretical background Racial hoaxes are becoming a popular discursive strategy to disguise racism. This concept has mainly been used in US legal and criminological f\u0133ields, aimed at exploring the connection between racial stereotypes and related practices in policing, and shifting criminal responsibility from a white offfender to a f\u0133ictional black predator (Russell, 1998). Nonetheless, this concept could be scrutinized from wider social and communicational perspectives, looking at how racial hoaxes are created and circulated, and how they afffect ethnic relations. The concept also provides powerful insights into study how prejudices and stereotypes are objectivized, and how hostility tales turn into social action. Moreover, racial hoaxes should be a relevant matter for communication studies, since they involve both mainstream and digital media, and have relevant consequences on public.",

organizations often rely on individuals for support, and outcomes of human rights campaigns often include numerous individual actions as a core determinant of their success. Furthermore, some of our most prominent theories regarding the effects of human rights in international relations emphasize the importance of average citizens in placing pressure on states to improve their human rights practices. Despite these realities, we know little about how individuals develop policy views on human rights, including the ways in which individual differences may systematically affect this process. In this paper, I argue that ideological differences along a left-right spectrum have considerable implications for the ways in which human rights issues are understood and processed by individuals. Bringing together research from three survey experiments, I theorize that political liberals prioritize the suffering experienced by the victims of human rights abuse but are skeptical of the use of force in their defense. Political conservatives, by contrast, respond more positively to images depicting graphic bodily harm, particularly when such abuses are inflicted towards members of the in-group. These observations provide a possible foundation for the building of new theories regarding political ideology and international human rights.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53974843, "asset_id": 34034009, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31655860, "first_name": "Joe", "last_name": "Braun", "domain_name": "umd", "page_name": "JBraun", "display_name": "Joe Braun", "profile_url": "https://umd.academia.edu/JBraun?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31655860/9378386/10452250/s65_joe.braun.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7369, "name": "Political communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_communication?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 11265, "name": "Media Framing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Framing?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 16323, "name": "Biopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biopolitics?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 22292, "name": "Political Ideology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Ideology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 69739, "name": "Framing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Framing?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 33794946, "title": "Claudia Rankine's Citizen: Outline for Teaching Purposes", "created_at": "2017-07-06T10:56:50.055-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33794946/Claudia_Rankines_Citizen_Outline_for_Teaching_Purposes?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_33794946", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53781353, "asset_id": 33794946, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 55817671, "first_name": "Maria", "last_name": "Rovito", "domain_name": "pennstate", "page_name": "MariaRovito", "display_name": "Maria  Rovito", "profile_url": "https://pennstate.academia.edu/MariaRovito?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/55817671/18713158/18671259/s65_maria.rovito.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2260, "name": "Disability Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disability_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6258, "name": "African American Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_American_Literature?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14912, "name": "African American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_American_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1755131, "name": "Claudia Rankine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Claudia_Rankine?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 32541609, "title": "Understanding Asian American Women's Pathways to School Leadership", "created_at": "2017-04-20T13:43:56.963-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32541609/Understanding_Asian_American_Womens_Pathways_to_School_Leadership?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_32541609", "summary": "Little is known about Asian American women administrators in the public schools.

Often moving beyond the conventional state-centred and dominant monolithic approach, or reinterpreting previously accepted stories, books in the series examine and explain themes from inter-communal relations, environment, health and society, and will explore ethnic, communal, racial, linguistic and religious developments that go beyond geopolitical compositions.\r\n\r\nBuilding on the foundations of scholarship within an interdisciplinary framework, this series spans the continuum of Near Eastern and Mediterranean traditions extending from the fourth millennium B.C. to the present \u2013 bridging previous fields which originally had little connection with each other. The aim is to enhance perspectives by applying various methodological approaches to dilemmas that have in the past been treated as the exclusive concern of a single given discipline.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n\r\nCreates a forum for marginalized and/or indigenous communities to engage with the \u2018accepted past and present\u2019 and to challenge previously accepted truths\r\nOpens a dialogue for alternative intellectual histories/narratives\r\nThe first series to focus on indigenous and minoritized related narratives from the understudied and often marginal perspective\r\nCovers cultural, linguistic, ethnic, gendered, political, numerical and economic communities in the Near and Middle East, the Mediterranean and its extended environs\r\nEngages with all periods of history from the ancient world to the present day, especially in terms of continuity of culture, cultural heritage and heritage preservation\r\nCommunities studied may include Alawites, Alevis, Armenians, Assyrians,

\u2018global city\u2019. For decades, some minority communities have lived with subtle but institutionalized and cultural discrimination permeating their existence. In recent years, social exclusion has been one of the important themes in policy debates in Hong Kong. It is increasingly recognized that there is a close relation between \u2018ethnicity\u2019 and \u2018social exclusion\u2019. According to our research on the life situation of the South Asian minority in Hong Kong, experiences of exclusion are common. This paper focuses on investigating dress as a form of cultural exclusion among Pakistani women in Hong Kong and how mainstream society constrains the bodies of its members through dress.\n",

study seeks to address a gap in research regarding the perspectives of coaches working within European teams comprising both domestic and immigrated players. In order to explore coaches\u2019 experience in working with multicultural teams, semi-structured interviews were conducted with six head coaches of professional basketball teams in Central and Northern Europe (two in Czech Republic, two in Germany, two in Latvia) and analysed using qualitative thematic analysis. The study focused primarily on communication and interaction between immigrated players and coaches, and on strategies used by coaches to overcome problems arising within multicultural teams. The findings identified three main themes: differences in values between foreign and domestic players/coaches; the formation of ethnic subgroups in teams; and race as a potentially problematic factor in coach-athlete relationships. The implications of this study include noting the importance of educational programs for coaches focused on raising cultural awareness, and recognising the need for further studies in this relatively under-researched area.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38808502, "asset_id": 12293873, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4114970, "first_name": "Anastasiya", "last_name": "Khomutova", "domain_name": "brighton", "page_name": "AnastasiyaKhomutova", "display_name": "Anastasiya Khomutova", "profile_url": "https://brighton.academia.edu/AnastasiyaKhomutova?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4114970/1591974/4169606/s65_anastasiya.khomutova.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 249, "name": "Sport Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sport_Psychology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3136, "name": "Qualitative methodology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qualitative_methodology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3843, "name": "Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5515, "name": "Cross-Cultural Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cross-Cultural_Psychology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 8032, "name": "Cross-Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cross-Cultural_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 12135, "name": "Qualitative Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qualitative_Research?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 15188, "name": "Sport And Exercise Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sport_And_Exercise_Psychology?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 21479, "name": "Cultural Diversity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Diversity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 36437, "name": "Thematic Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thematic_Analysis?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 49905, "name": "Sport", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sport?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 55904, "name": "Sports Coaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sports_Coaching?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 113891, "name": "Basketball", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Basketball?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 432449, "name": "Basketball sport coaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Basketball_sport_coaching?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 2649342, "title": "Kowal, E.

In this essay, I examine and reject several promising exclusivist arguments including, Levinson\u2019s attention account, Mag Uidhir\u2019s manner inspecificty account, and Michael Rea\u2019s use account.  I then ask what might motivate one to preserve a fairly firm art/pornography distinction.  One answer appeals to evaluative insights about the harm of pornography.  However, I argue, such insights will not support exclusivism.  Further, I offer an additional source of the moral evaluation of inegalitarian sexualized images of women, be they pornography or not, that does not rely on the harm hypothesis.  On my view, the meaning of this kind of imagery is made incorrigible by the social context in which it is produced and consumed, namely one in which women\u2019s oppression is tied to their being viewed as for the sexual delectation of men.  As a result, such images are deeply morally flawed.  In taking an attitude of sexual delectation toward such imagery one would have to bracket its incorrigible social meaning.

The songs played by mariachis narrate nostalgic, humorous, and emotional stories of love, heartache, death, drinking and place. Mariachis are most commonly comprised of men and are heavily associated with drinking, overt emotionality, fiestas, and cowboys; they are virtually interchangeable with the stereotype of the Mexican macho. A combination of popular films, radio and state-sponsored performances of mariachis at national events led to the transformation of mariachi into a national symbol and myth associated with machismo, regionalism and 'mestizaje' (racial and cultural mixing of Spanish, Indigenous and African people and culture). My dissertation will explore the ways in which performances of mariachi, Mexico's most recognised musical style, are entangled with representations of gender, sexuality, race, region, and class that order, contest, and produce ideals of Mexico and what it means to be Mexican. In particular, I will examine how this connection between mariachi and Mexican identity is worked out in the state of Jalisco, the purported birthplace of mariachi, which claims an important place in the Mexican national landscape as the birthplace not only of mariachi but also to Mexican national identity itself. I will analyse the stereotypical and metonymic link between mariachi and a perceived Mexican \"essence\" in its performance of mestizaje, machismo, and regionalism. My argument is that mariachi is a performative site wherein notions of nationalism, race, class, region, sexuality and gender are constantly produced, related, reified and undermined. Specifically, I contend that the performance of mariachi is 'excessive' and opens the performance to critique and to the possibility of failure. To illustrate this I examine the performance of all female mariachis, rumours of homosexual mariachis and traditional (indigenous) mariachis.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58508167, "asset_id": 38445959, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 103510037, "first_name": "Mary-Lee", "last_name": "Mulholland", "domain_name": "mtroyal", "page_name": "MaryLeeMulholland", "display_name": "Mary-Lee Mulholland", "profile_url": "https://mtroyal.academia.edu/MaryLeeMulholland?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/103510037/23047563/22177003/s65_mary-lee.mulholland.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2858, "name": "Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Culture?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9043, "name": "Performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 10871, "name": "Regionalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Regionalism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 43881, "name": "Mexico", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mexico?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 49532, "name": "Jalisco", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jalisco?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 650725, "name": "Mariachi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mariachi?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1699475, "name": "Musica Mariachi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Musica_Mariachi?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 27986332, "title": "The Threatening Nature of \" Rap \" Music", "created_at": "2016-08-24T12:20:28.161-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27986332/The_Threatening_Nature_of_Rap_Music?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_27986332", "summary": "Rap music has had a contentious relationship with the legal system, including censorship, regulation, and artists being arrested for lewd and profane performances. More recently, rap lyrics have been introduced by prosecutors to establish guilt in criminal trials. Some fear this form of artistic expression will be inappropriately interpreted as literal and threatening, perhaps because of stereotypes. Only a handful of studies have examined whether rap lyrics are evaluated using stereotypes, yet these studies were conducted in the 1990s\u2014a period of heightened scrutiny for rap\u2014and used nonoptimal methods. This study presents 3 experiments that examine the impact of genre-specific stereotypes on the evaluation of violent song lyrics by manipulating the musical genre (rap vs. country) while holding constant the actual lyrics. Study 1, a direct replication of previous research, found that participants deemed identical lyrics more literal, offensive, and in greater need of regulation when they were characterized as rap compared with country. Study 2 was a conceptual replication (i.e., same design but different stimuli), and again detected this effect. Study 3 used the same approach but experimentally manipulated the race of the author of the lyrics. A main effect was detected for the genre, with rap evaluated more negatively than country or a control condition with no label. However, no effects were found for the race of the lyrics' author nor were interactions were detected. Collectively, these findings highlight the possibility that rap lyrics could inappropriately impact jurors when admitted as evidence to prove guilt.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53528801, "asset_id": 27986332, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 76989, "first_name": "Charis", "last_name": "Kubrin", "domain_name": "uci", "page_name": "CharisKubrin", "display_name": "Charis Kubrin", "profile_url": "https://uci.academia.edu/CharisKubrin?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/76989/297379/33251725/s65_charis.kubrin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 189, "name": "Criminology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 535, "name": "Criminal Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminal_Law-1?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14904, "name": "Hip-Hop/Rap", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hip-Hop_Rap?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 177803, "name": "Racial Bias", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_Bias?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 188224, "name": "Rap music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rap_music?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 397947, "name": "Threats", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Threats?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 832204, "name": "Criminal Courts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminal_Courts?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 33264468, "title": "Racial/Ethnic and Social Inequities in Sleep Medicine: The Tip of the Iceberg", "created_at": "2017-05-30T11:32:50.889-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33264468/Racial_Ethnic_and_Social_Inequities_in_Sleep_Medicine_The_Tip_of_the_Iceberg?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_33264468", "summary": "Purpose: It is known that racial disparities exist in terms of disease prevalence and access to health care. However, the link between race/ ethnicity and sleep quality is often under-recognized. Results: Current evidence shows that differences exist between Blacks and Whites in terms of sleep duration, sleep quality, and the likelihood of acquiring a sleep disorder. It has been argued that the adverse effects of ethnicity on sleep quality or duration interact with other social or personal factors (such as employment) and that the effects of these factors are interactive and need to be analyzed simultaneously. There is a growing body of evidence showing that disturbed sleep is a mediator of the effect of environmental stressors on personal health, which is more pronounced in ethnic minorities. Conclusions: These findings support the notion that perceived discrimination or unfair treatment has significant associations with complaints of sleep disturbance and disturbed objective measures of sleep quality and sleep architecture. Hence, greater efforts are needed to demonstrate how racial/ ethnic factors influence different sleep processes.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53333765, "asset_id": 33264468, "asset_type":

Through our research, we learn that race and ethnicity are key dimensions of social stratification and inequality in contemporary Hong Kong society. We hope that this research can well serve as a case to illustrate the relationship between race/ethnicity and employment opportunities in Hong Kong. In this research, our target groups are the Filipinos, Indians, Nepalese and Pakistanis.\n\nThis research consists of a questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews. The questionnaire survey was conducted between March and July 2005. We have completed 200 questionnaires with the help of ethnic minority members. The questionnaire covered four broad areas: employment situation, employment difficulties, employment assistance and lastly, their sense of belonging to Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the in-depth interviews aimed to further explore the complex dynamic of employment experiences that could not be described by quantitative data in the survey, as well as to develop recommendations for improving social policies in relation to their employment conditions. Twenty in-depth discussions with South Asian ethnic minority individuals were conducted from July 2005 to March 2006.\n\nOn employment situation, almost sixty percent are employed full-time and thirteen percent of the respondents are unemployed. Among the latter, around thirty percent have been unemployed for more than a year. Considering the occupational status, slightly more than one-third are engaged in elementary occupations, close to thirty percent as service workers and shop sales workers, and around thirteen percent as clerks. Those working as managers and administrators, professionals and associate professionals amount to around nineteen percent and around three percent work as plant and machine operators and assemblers. We discover that more than seventy percent have received assistance from family members, relatives and friends in getting their current or last job, followed by around twenty percent having obtained their current or last job through newspapers, magazines or internet advertisements.\n\n\fConcerning employment difficulties, close to forty percent of the respondents have experienced some form of unemployment in the past two years and approximately sixty percent report they feel it is difficult to search for a job in Hong Kong. Three-quarters of the respondents cite not knowing Cantonese and/or Mandarin as the difficulty and slightly more than one-third feel they have been rejected for not being a Chinese person. Other difficulties reported include job advertisements being written in Chinese, their qualification not being recognized in Hong Kong, having low educational qualifications, having no-one who can help introduce jobs, the cultural and/or religious differences, lack of skills, fees of job referral agency being too high, not knowing English, age discrimination, and immigration policy. Our respondents also report having some difficulties at workplace, such as communication problems with supervisors, bosses and colleagues, not being able to receive salary on time, being bullied, having conflicts involving cultural and/or religious practices, being unreasonably fired for being an ethnic minority person, and experiencing some unequal treatment at work. The respondents were asked whether they have experienced differential treatment at work when comparing themselves with Chinese workers. On chances to be employed, half of the respondents cite they have lower prospects compared to Chinese people and on promotion opportunity, forty-two percent cite less chances than Chinese. Around one-forth feel they have more workload and higher chances of being laid off first than the Chinese workers.\n\nOn employment assistance, around one-third report having sought help from the Labour Department to search for a job. Among those who have not sought help, almost sixty percent cite not having the need to be one of the reasons, while slightly more than one quarter did not know the availability of such services in Hong Kong, and close to twenty percent consider the services to be not useful as the services are provided in Chinese. For those having sought help, they report various difficulties in using the services of the Labour Department, such as the staff not being able to find a job for them, the services being provided in Chinese, the staff not being able to understand their needs, they themselves having communication problems with the staff, and the staff not being helpful or having discriminatory attitude against them. Concerning the retraining services organized by institutes in Hong Kong, slightly more than two-third have not joined any courses. For those who have joined, close to seventy percent report having participated in courses run by the Construction Industry Training Authority (CITA). Our respondents have cited various difficulties when it comes to using retraining services in Hong Kong, such as not knowing the courses, courses being conducted in the Chinese language, not being able to find any suitable courses, time of the course not being suitable for them, course fees being too expensive, their educational qualification not meeting the entry requirements, and qualification of the courses not being useful or recognized. Generally speaking, around forty-four percent of our respondents are not satisfied with their employment situation in Hong Kong.\n\nOn the sense of belonging to Hong Kong, almost two-third of the respondents identify themselves both by their ethnic origin and as a Hong Kong person, and almost half of them express that they like Hong Kong very much. Among our respondents, two-thirds have experienced racial discrimination in Hong Kong. Therefore, while discussing their attitudes towards Hong Kong people in general, most came up with examples and personal life experiences in Hong Kong to demonstrate the presence of discrimination against them by the local people. According to the statistical data, nearly half of them express they do not find Hong Kong people to be kind and helpful, whereas a higher proportion of them report that Hong Kong people are not caring and do not treat people of different races and nationalities equally. Generally speaking, eighty-one percent of them agree that most of their friends are non-Chinese people. Although fifty-five percent report having close Chinese friends, in our in-depth discussions, most interviewees report not having close Chinese friends at all. Lastly, they tend to have strong ethnic pride as more than ninety-six percent agree they are proud of their own ethnic origin.\n\nBased on the employment situation reflected in the questionnaire survey and the opinions expressed in the in-depth interviews, we recommend policy changes and improvements in the following areas: labour legislation, retraining services, accreditation of overseas qualification, legislation against racial discrimination and multicultural policy. To improve the employment conditions of South Asian ethnic minority groups in Hong Kong, we believe that improvements in these aspects are essential to assisting them in better integrating into Hong Kong society.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51543146, "asset_id": 31107815, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 41717295, "first_name": "Hok Bun", "last_name": "Ku", "domain_name": "cpce-polyu", "page_name": "HokKu", "display_name": "Hok Bun  Ku", "profile_url": "https://cpce-polyu.academia.edu/HokKu?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/41717295/11331335/12640951/s65_hok.ku.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25021, "name": "Hong Kong", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hong_Kong?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 24603361, "title": "Race and the dual state in the early American republic", "created_at": "2016-04-20T15:00:19.783-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24603361/Race_and_the_dual_state_in_the_early_American_republic?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_24603361", "summary": "Prior to the Civil War, racial exploitation was at the heart of the Anglo-American strategy of political and economic development. Put simply, the Anglo-American state successfully redistributed wealth from Native Americans and African Americans to white males and their families. Native American land was expropriated and sold at low prices or given to Anglo-American settlers fueling the agrarian economies of both the North and South. Chattel slavery deprived African Americans of both the fruits of their labor and their basic human rights. But it also underpinned the rise of cotton production in the South, a major driver of American economic growth in the antebellum period. These developments were not an accidental product of white racism, but the result of a political economy strategy, which created a dual American state: a contract state, premised on the rule of law, that promoted the growth of a prosperous, liberal democratic society of Anglo-Americans, and a predatory\nstate that financed white liberal society through its ruthless exploitation of Indian lands and African American labor.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44932932, "asset_id": 24603361, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26246, "first_name": "Jeffrey", "last_name": "Meiser", "domain_name": "up", "page_name": "JeffreyMeiser", "display_name": "Jeffrey Meiser", "profile_url": "https://up.academia.edu/JeffreyMeiser?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26246/8570/22353836/s65_jeffrey.meiser.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 129, "name": "American History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 296, "name": "Black Studies Or African American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Studies_Or_African_American_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 390, "name": "American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 794, "name": "American Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Politics?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2864, "name": "U.S. history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/U.S._history?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5061, "name": "Native American Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Native_American_Politics?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6226, "name": "American Political Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Political_Development?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6261, "name": "Nineteenth Century United States", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nineteenth_Century_United_States?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 13287, "name": "American Political Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Political_Thought?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14912, "name": "African American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_American_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 28507, "name": "History of Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 11605112, "title": "Gespr\u00e4che \u00fcber Rassismus.

This excavates from the closet of memory the story of the Cinema cell, the group of young film enthusiasts who, in fascist Italy, engaged in what today we would call \" media activism \" : they put their lives on the line, infiltrated the film industry, and shouldered the movie camera as their initial weapon of combat against a defiant totalitarianism. Here, I focus on how the underground formation elaborated an iteration of filmic realism that countered the implantation in the body politic of racialized fantasies of national identity. In tracing the cell's efforts to develop a gaze on the nation that would oppose the race-driven realism advocated by Mussolini's son Vittorio, among others, I establish a genealogy for Visconti's 1943 Ossessione and its display of queerness as the authentic alternative to fascist life.

As presidents worked to rebuild the federal government during the Mexican Revolution of 1910 to 1940, they also strove to rid the country of alcoholism.  In particular, utilizing prejudiced notions of class, ethnicity, and gender, they targeted working-class and indigenous men, who they tried to transform into pacifistic patriarchs, efficient workers, and sober, responsible citizens.  However, the case study of Sonora demonstrates that this federal project did not go uncontested.  Presidents relied on governors and legislators to mandate temperance, mayors to enforce these laws, and citizens to follow them, but these people did not always willingly comply and thus policies often had to be modified.  In other instances, ordinary people supported the anti-alcohol campaign, creating unofficial temperance leagues, petitioning the president to close more cantinas, or demanding that corrupt authorities obey alcohol legislation.  Governors\u2019, mayors\u2019, and especially citizens\u2019 contributions to the anti-alcohol campaign and the State-building process may not have been equal to those of federal leaders, but both projects certainly benefited from the input of a diverse cross-section of society.  \r\n\r\nThis present research adds to and combines three historiographical fields on the history of alcohol, State-building, and the social and cultural components of revolutions.  It is the first, full-length study of the anti-alcohol campaign during the Mexican Revolution and the only work about Mexico as of yet to examine temperance from the national, state, municipal, and popular perspective.  This work also corroborates the argument of recent political scholars, demonstrating that the process of State formation was shaped by input from individuals on a variety of planes.  Finally, this dissertation shows that the government\u2019s cultural policies, which included promoting high art, distributing propaganda, and carrying out campaigns such as the temperance movement, should not be seen as trivial.  Rather, attempts to form a new, modern citizenry through these projects were a vital part of the State-building process and of social revolution in general.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 76526203, "asset_id": 64537515, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7313579, "first_name": "Gretchen", "last_name": "Pierce", "domain_name": "ship", "page_name": "GretchenPierce", "display_name": "Gretchen Pierce", "profile_url": "https://ship.academia.edu/GretchenPierce?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7313579/7996322/8956752/s65_gretchen.pierce.jpg_oh_5f3fd3b073921d140ec3e4fb833807c5_oe_55aeeb1f___gda___1438395534_86951b3dc7b6ad1f90ccea5fb1053a96"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2272, "name": "Gender History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6993, "name": "Alcohol Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alcohol_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10495, "name": "Nationalism And State Building", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism_And_State_Building?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 43881, "name": "Mexico", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mexico?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 110478, "name": "History of Revolutions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Revolutions?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 45634770, "title": "Mixed: Multiracial College Students Tell Their Life Stories edited by Andrew Garrod, Robert Kilkenny, Christina G\u00f3mez (review", "created_at": "2021-03-29T07:20:21.046-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45634770/Mixed_Multiracial_College_Students_Tell_Their_Life_Stories_edited_by_Andrew_Garrod_Robert_Kilkenny_Christina_G%C3%B3mez_review?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_45634770", "summary": "Mixed: Multiracial College Students Tell Their\nLife Stories presents multiracial student essays\nfocusing on growing up and living as a\nmixed-race individual in a society founded\non monoracial understandings of race.

However, contemporary immigrations disrupted this multiracialism. The political response focused on managing the mobilities of low-wage migrant workers. Drawing on my research on urban change, I show that the this led to the biopolitical management of migrant worker mobilities and articulation of the discourse of needs. I argue that the 2013 riot by migrant workers accelerated the production of dormitory space to exclude migrant workers from access to the city and reproduce their physical needs.

Drawing on Rawls' discussion of background justice and Young's work on structural injustice, it argues that addressing this structural injustice requires constructing a regime of global migration governance that regulates state migration policies 1 An earlier version of this paper was presented at a workshop on \"Race, Gender and Class in the Politics of Migration\" organised by Antje Ellerman at the Social Science Research Center in Berlin, Germany, on May 12-13, 2017.

In order to investigate this underrepresentation, we interviewed 201 college seniors, primarily women and people of color, who either majored in STEM or started but dropped a STEM major. Here we discuss one section of the longer interview that focused on students' sense of belonging, which has been found to be related to retention. In our analysis, we examine the intersections of race and gender with students' sense of belonging, a topic largely absent from the current literature. Results: We found that white men were most likely to report a sense of belonging whereas women of color were the least likely. Further, we found that representation within one's STEM sub-discipline, namely biology versus the physical sciences, impacts sense of belonging for women. Four key factors were found to contribute to sense of belonging for all students interviewed: interpersonal relationships, perceived competence, personal interest, and science identity. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that students who remain in STEM majors report a greater sense of belonging than those who leave STEM. Additionally, we found that students from underrepresented groups are less likely to feel they belong. These findings highlight structural and cultural features of universities, as well as STEM curricula and pedagogy, that continue to privilege white males.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57136277, "asset_id": 37184924, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 88223424, "first_name": "Katherine", "last_name": "Rainey", "domain_name": "colorado", "page_name": "KatherineRainey", "display_name": "Katherine Rainey", "profile_url": "https://colorado.academia.edu/KatherineRainey?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/88223424/26954067/25401705/s65_katherine.rainey.jpg"}, {"id": 88322207, "first_name": "Roslyn", "last_name": "Mickelson", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RoslynMickelson", "display_name": "Roslyn Mickelson", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RoslynMickelson?f_ri=5453", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50118, "name": "Representation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Representation?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 86911, "name": "Retention", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Retention?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 706380, "name": "Intersectional", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectional?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 37032469, "title": "Interview mit Christian Geulen: Race und \u201eRasse\u201c.

The author reflects on his work in a class called \u201cDiversity in Education\u201d over the course of two semesters as a way to trace the genealogy of a course that has emancipatory intent. The implications (tensions and contradictions) for this type of course in teacher education are discussed as are why critical pedagogical approaches and liberatory ways of thinking and knowing are fundamentally essential to and ethically necessary in teacher preparation. The author concludes by offering a pedagogy of resilience and radical hope that is fundamentally premised on the idea that intellectual work is meant to be liberationist, and the desire to connect teacher education to a larger political struggle.\n\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/iiJzPZWcaMM8AvyP4Pmf/full", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56536964, "asset_id": 12334198, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3040014, "first_name": "Kevin D.", "last_name": "Lam", "domain_name": "drake", "page_name": "KevinLam", "display_name": "Kevin D.

Drawing attention to the earthquake as a destructive yet revelatory moment of trans-Pacific ties, the article analyzes the multi-stranded racial, spatial and material negotiations that allowed the Chinese community to maneuver within the structure of domination and effectively resist hegemonic discourse. It demonstrates how, in the quest for spatial justice, coalitions of Chinese elites and politicians relied on existing Sino-American trade networks as leverage for inclusion, sought financial aid from the far-flung Qing government, deployed legal assistance from conglomerations of Chinese-American lobbyists and Western-trained Chinese lawyers, and mobilised capital from wealthy Hong Kong merchants to reconstruct Chinatown from scratch.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56166373, "asset_id": 12216362, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3660478,

Tracking in Flanders is intended to group students according to their abilities but together with this, students are grouped together according to their ethnic and socioeconomic\nbackground. In the present study, the interethnic relations and attitudes in each track will be explored, based on ethnographic observations and semi-structured interviews in three multi-ethnic secondary schools in one\ncity. Our findings suggest that different patterns occur across three groups of tracks: the most appreciated fields of study in academic, the intermediary (less appreciated fields of study in academic and technical tracks) and vocational tracks. According to the relative sizes of ethnic groups and track specific characteristics, interethnic relations were characterized respectively by ethnic segregation, positive experiences of interethnic contact or ethnic conflict/tensions.

By fostering a social justice approach to health, we go beyond the documentation of race - associated differences in health outcomes to expose differences in underlying exposures and\nopportunities, resources, and risks. We augment the call to eliminate racial health disparities with a strategy for doing so by focusing attention on the social context in which these disparities arise and are perpetuated. By fostering a social justice approach to health, we provide both a moral imperative and identifiable targets for action to eliminate health disparities and improve the health and well being of the black community\nand the entire nation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49288885, "asset_id": 25063316, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 43645834, "first_name": "Anthony", "last_name": "Hatch", "domain_name": "wesleyan", "page_name": "AnthonyHatch", "display_name": "Anthony R Hatch", "profile_url": "https://wesleyan.academia.edu/AnthonyHatch?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/43645834/12715012/19726959/s65_anthony.hatch.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7437, "name": "Health Disparities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Health_Disparities?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14912, "name": "African American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_American_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16288, "name": "Public Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Health?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 43150, "name": "Anti-Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anti-Racism?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 9885843, "title": "Nasionalise Konflik Etnis", "created_at": "2014-12-24T02:38:16.750-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9885843/Nasionalise_Konflik_Etnis?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_9885843", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36045068, "asset_id": 9885843, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 23990224, "first_name": "Manda", "last_name": "Arief", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MandaArief", "display_name": "Manda Arief", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MandaArief?f_ri=5453", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 8810559, "title": "The Making of Arab Americans: From Syrian Nationalism to U.

Based on new archival evidence from private the public sources in the U. S. and the Near East, the Making of Arab Americans build to the first time a transnational narrative of Arab American identity development by meticulously chronicling the operations of four major political organizations: The Free Syria Society, 1915; The New Syria Party, 1927; The Arab National League, 1936; ad the Institute of Arab American Affairs, 1945. These were the immigrants responses to calamitous events in their homeland in the Levant. These responses evolved and grew more sophisticated with each attempt until their pan-Arab posture in the 1930's in response to the Palestinian revolt in 1936, combined with ascribing to American citizenship on the eve of WW II. The emergent Arab Americans did not abandon their dual loyalty to Arab causes while assuming an ambassadorial role of representing the U. S. in the Arab World within a cultural pluralist framework.

Drawing on both Critical Race Theory and African Post-Colonial literature, I focus on the ideology formation and development of racial liberalism in South Africa as a colonized state, South Africa as an apartheid state and South Africa in the post-apartheid era. Using Charles W. Mill\u2019s The Racial Contract as a theoretical basis for how white supremacism came to be and why the \u201ccontract\u201d has changed over time, this paper hopes to explain the seemingly contradicting nature of European Liberal philosophical traditions and the expanse of white supremacism in South Africa. Racism and Colonialism are often seen as a deviation from the Liberal traditions of the Enlightenment. However, I will argue that colonization of South Africa by Europeans and the white supremacist institutions they established were not aberrations from the \u201cnoble\u201d Liberal tradition but rather a fundamental aspect of it. The exportation of Liberalism established a \u201cracial contract\u201d in South Africa which justified the existence of European rule and the Otherization of indigenous South Africans. This explains and mends the contradiction of the Western intellectual tradition at the time of the Enlightenment and after, believing in tenants of inalienable rights and the equality of man while simultaneously engaging in white supremacism, colonization and apartheid. Using Critical Race Theory and the writings of African Post-Colonial Theorists Frantz Fanon, Aime Cesaire and Albert Memmi we can come to realize that the existence of apartheid does not violate the ideals of Liberalism but rather confirms them. This sociopolitical analysis will explain the existence of colonization and apartheid in South Africa.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31643666, "asset_id": 4130343, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2799146, "first_name": "Phoenix", "last_name": "Singer", "domain_name": "pdx", "page_name": "PhoenixSinger", "display_name": "Phoenix Singer", "profile_url": "https://pdx.academia.edu/PhoenixSinger?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2799146/941546/1179420/s65_phoenix.singer.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30010, "name": "Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Empire?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 1130856, "title": "Psychological Damage or Resistance?

Most children identified white dolls as \"nice\" and black dolls as \"bad\"-proof, the Clarks argued, that segregation damaged black children psychologically. These findings figured pivotally in Brown v. Board of Education. Bernstein defamiliarizes the \"doll test\" by locating it not in the history of Civil Rights but instead in the history of representational play involving racialized dolls. Bernstein argues that a black child's rejection of a black doll might indeed reveal internalized racism; but it could also constitute a rejection of violently racist practices of play that had, for a century, been coordinated through black dolls. Thus Bernstein offers a new understanding of the Clarks' child-subjects not as passive internalizers of racism instead as agents who resisted inherited traditions of performance.",

dominated by traditional textbooks. These textbooks generally take a fairly similar approach, dividing the field up into chapters based on disciplinary subfields like culture, family, deviance, race/ethnicity, and so forth. While these approaches are certainly thorough, what they possess in breadth they often lack in sociological imagination \u2013 the kind of spark that ignites a cognitive connection between one\u2019s private troubles and public, or structural issues. The sociological imagination was defined by C. Wright Mills as \"the vivid awareness of the relationship between experience and the wider society.\" Similarly, Peter Berger talks about a sociological \"perspective\", which allowed one to \"see the general in the particular\". Indeed, our hope as teachers is that our students won\u2019t necessarily memorize everything there is to know about sociology as a discipline, but that they develop a sociological imagination, or perspective, that allows them to think broadly about the problems and issues in their individual lives, and move beyond the limitations of myopic individualism. By starting with consumer culture, and the \"stuff\" it so voluminously produces, this book will encourage students to unpack the back-story behind the stuff they love (and the stuff they hate). Through this process, they will see that the seemingly individual act of shopping \u2013 whether that be selecting a tube of toothpaste, or ordering a pair of shoes online \u2013 is never a solo experience. Instead, it is a profoundly collective phenomenon that joins the cultural and the material world, individual agents with broader structures, and local realities with global

"Emotions are central to inequalities, yet scholarship in the areas of race, class and emotion has yet to examine how race and class affect the distribution and experience of emotions, and how

In this chapter, we weave together the existing emotions literature addressing race and class with other scholarship on race and class inequalities to generate some starting points for a more robust sociology of race, class, and emotions. First, we present literature from the scholarship on mental health to examine the impact of class and race disparities on the distribution of emotions. Second, we examine how social and cultural influences associated with class and race shape emotions. Third, we discuss how processes of emotional socialization tie emotions to identities. Fourth, we examine emotions in the workplace. Finally, we end the chapter with an examination of emotional hierarchies and their impact on positionality and interaction.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37597653, "asset_id": 9321580, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 58853125, "first_name": "Jennifer", "last_name": "Pace", "domain_name": "mwsu", "page_name": "JenniferPace", "display_name": "Jennifer Pace", "profile_url": "https://mwsu.academia.edu/JenniferPace?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/58853125/15391926/16027634/s65_jennifer.pace.jpg"}, {"id": 1022911, "first_name": "Amy", "last_name": "Wilkins", "domain_name": "colorado", "page_name": "AmyWilkins", "display_name": "Amy Wilkins", "profile_url": "https://colorado.academia.edu/AmyWilkins?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1022911/570606/12203513/s65_amy.wilkins.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 248, "name": "Social Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Psychology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5273, "name": "Class", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Class?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9456, "name": "Emotions (Social Psychology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotions_Social_Psychology_?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50064, "name": "Social inequlity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_inequlity?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 332191, "title": "Race and the (Im) Possibility of Dialogue", "created_at": "2010-09-19T23:30:24.828-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/332191/Race_and_the_Im_Possibility_of_Dialogue?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_332191", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 5936112, "asset_id": 332191, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 249879, "first_name": "Mark", "last_name": "McPhail", "domain_name": "linfield", "page_name": "MarkMcPhail", "display_name": "Mark L .

Even the vocabulary of modern European expansion is Roman: The words imperialism, empire, colonialism, colony, proconsul, procurator all come from Rome. In addition, Roman approaches  towards acquisi\u00adtion and administration of conquered territory and individuals provided the foundation, the \u201cblueprint,\u201d for later European expansion and  rule. During the later years of the Roman Republic independent, private companies collected taxes, lent money, fielded troops, and controlled the economies of Roman possessions outside of Italy. All of these pseudogovernmental powers were replicated by the great, modern colonial corporations--the French, Dutch, and British East India com\u00adpanies. The works of Cicero, especially his speeches against Gaius Verres, were perennial favorites in public school curricula. It is surely no accident that the great companies associated with European imperialism resembled their Roman predecessors so closely. This was  true not  just for the Latin-based cultures, such as France and Spain, where Roman institutions and traditions occasionally survived intact, but also for nations of Germanic ancestry, such as Britain, Holland, and Germany, where the Roman legacy was less  direct  but still intentional.

Building on previous studies of activist burnout in racial justice activists and examinations of the roles of white activists in antiracism movements, this study represents one attempt to fill this gap. We analyzed data from interviews with racial justice activists of color in the United States who have experienced burnout to identify the ways they attributed their burnout to the attitudes and behaviors-the racism-of white activists.

The annexation of Puerto Rico and the Philippines in 1898 gave rise to a complex and often volatile system of border-making. Overseas expansion changed the territorial nature of the state, as both the Philippines and Puerto Rico were declared \" unincorporated territories \" defined as neither fully domestic nor completely foreign. Territorial statecraft treated the Philippines and Puerto Rico similarly. However , statecraft towards individuals (as opposed to territories) differentiated the two populations as Puerto Ricans were declared U.S. citizens in 1917 but Filipinos were not. This essay explores how U.S. policies toward these territories and populations became increasingly complex and contradictory as the state tried to manage the national polity in the age of imperial expansion.

Most members of the Church celebrated the decision as a revelation and long-awaited answer to prayer. However, some were angry about the end to theologically-justified segregation, and many left the Church to join the Mormon fundamentalist movement that sought to retain early Mormon teachings, including doctrinal racism. While most studies on Mormon fundamentalism present the tradition as one of continuity in the face of change, this article argues that Mormon fundamentalist doctrinal racism emerged as a central tenet of the faith only when desegregation became the subject of national debate in the 1970s. Rather than view the persistence of the priesthood and temple restrictions in Mormon fundamentalism as a continuation of early LDS teachings, this article reframes the persistence of the priesthood and temple ban as a form of white backlash in response to the Black civil rights movement and integration in LDS worship.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 87267746, "asset_id": 81109005, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 97181263, "first_name": "Cristina", "last_name": "Rosetti", "domain_name": "utahtech", "page_name": "CristinaRosetti", "display_name": "Cristina Rosetti", "profile_url": "https://utahtech.academia.edu/CristinaRosetti?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/97181263/21200846/61418234/s65_cristina.rosetti.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6638, "name": "American Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Religion?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23543, "name": "Mormon History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mormon_History?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 125925, "name": "Whiteness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Whiteness?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 637196, "name": "Mormon Fundamentalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mormon_Fundamentalism?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 74883030, "title": "Muslim Men, Racialised Masculinities and Personal Life", "created_at": "2022-03-29T06:53:40.897-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/74883030/Muslim_Men_Racialised_Masculinities_and_Personal_Life?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_74883030", "summary": "This article contributes to the study of Muslim men and masculinities by drawing attention to the usefulness of exploring the under-researched relational, emotional and intimate dimensions of Muslim men\u2019s lives.

During the semester, we will explore the complexity of the history (or histories) of thirty-three countries. While we cannot learn about all thirty-three nations, the class materials will focus on critical and seminal events that characterized Latin America since independence from Spain. In understanding the region's histories, lectures will touch on issues related to class, race, gender, economics, sexualities, religion, state-building, and governance. Unlike high school history courses that emphasize memorization of dates and male political figures, this course seeks to push students to think about historical developments and change over time. As an instructor using a social historian perspective, the class will highlight overarching trends that historically bind the region together and underscore local and/or national particularities. The class readings will include a combination of texts written by US and Latin American scholars to offer different views.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65495116, "asset_id": 44962098, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 64875, "first_name": "Romina A.", "last_name": "Green Rioja", "domain_name": "wlu", "page_name": "RominaAGreenRioja", "display_name": "Romina A.

We argue that a correlation exists between antisemitism and anti-Israelism, but the correlation varies widely in strength by social context. It follows that, in some cases, extremists on both sides of the debate are correct. However, in most cases they are not. We make our case by examining the Canadian context and referring to research from Canada and other countries. Specifically, we demonstrate that the level of antisemitic sentiment in Canada is relatively low. Moreover, with the exception of the actions of a small number of extremists, antisemitic incidents are not skyrocketing in frequency, contrary to the claims of some observers. We also argue that, while antisemitism and anti-Israelism are correlated in some categories of the population, circumstantial evidence leads one to believe that, in the population at large, the correlation is weak. This finding suggests that antisemitism and anti-Israelism are typically independent attitudinal and behavioral dimensions, with the overlap between them varying by context. It further implies that strong emotional attachment to the Jewish state is compatible with a critical stance toward the current state of political and social affairs in Israel, even a highly critical stance.

However, few studies have focused on the experiences of racialized and migrant trans youth. Our article aims to address this apparent gap in the Francophone literature by presenting the preliminary results of a community-based participatory action research project that seeks to better understand the experiences of trans youth in Quebec between the ages 15 to 25. We discuss various forms of oppression faced by these young people, as well as certain privileges, while also addressing the impact of this oppression and these privileges on the experiences of racialized and migrant trans youth who must navigate pre-established gender norms. The article also examines how factors such as gender identity, citizenship, race and age interconnect and interact. Ultimately, these factors shape young people\u2019s medical, social and legal transitions. Furthermore, different axes of social differentiation and the obstacles they create affect the young people\u2019s trajectories and sometimes prevent them from fully expressing their multiple identities. Finally, we highlight the strength and resilience of racialized and migrant trans youth, as well as how they respond to multiple forms of oppression.\nKEYWORDS: racialized and migrant trans youth,

memiliki peninggalan budaya yang sangat menarik untuk dibahas. Bentuk peninggalan budaya tersebut dapat dilihat dari kuil-kuil, artifak sejarah, hingga kisah-kisah mitologi. Pada tulisan ini akan difokuskan terhadap kisah-kisah mitologi yang dimiliki oleh masyarakat Yunani dan bagaimana penulis melihatnya dari sisi lain, yaitu melalui perspektif feminisme.\nMelalui sudut pandang feminisme penulis akan membahas bagaimana posisi wanita pada cerita mitologi Yunani, salah satunya adalah pada kisah dewa-dewinya. Pada cerita mitologinya, Yunani pada masa tersebut masyarakatnya merupakan penganut Politeisme. Oleh karena itu terdapat beberapa dewa-dewi yang mereka puja untuk kemudian dapat memenuhi kebutuhan hidupnya. Beberapa dewa-dewi tersebut adalah Zeus, Poseideon, Hades, Hera, dan Arthemis. Masing-masing dewa memiliki peran dan tugasnya masing-masing. Hanya saja terdapat ketimpangan peran yang dimiliki oleh para dewa dan dewi, dimana para dewa memiliki peran yang dominan dibandingkan para dewi.\nDengan demikian dapat menjadi sebuah bahasan yang menarik untuk dibahas dalam tulisan ini, dipandang dari perspektif feminisme. Penulis kemudian akan lebih memfokuskan pada perspektif feminis liberal yang membahas mengenai kesetaraan peran antara pria dan wanita. Tidak selalu pria yang mendapatkan peran-peran penting, tetapi wanita juga layak untuk mendapatkan kesetaraan peran tersebut.\n\nKata kunci: Feminisme, Budaya, Mitologi, Yunani, Peran Wanita, Feminis Liberal.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35487041, "asset_id": 9208314, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10025000, "first_name": "ignatius", "last_name": "yerico", "domain_name": "universitasbrawijaya", "page_name": "ignatiusyerico", "display_name": "ignatius yerico", "profile_url": "https://universitasbrawijaya.academia.edu/ignatiusyerico?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10025000/6750533/7623888/s65_ignatius.yerico.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 123, "name": "Mythology And Folklore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mythology_And_Folklore?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 928, "name": "Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28981, "name": "Ethnic Conflict and Civil War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Conflict_and_Civil_War?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 8233573, "title": "(2015) \"Against the New Metaphysics of Race\" Philosophy of Science", "created_at": "2014-09-07T17:24:58.329-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8233573/_2015_Against_the_New_Metaphysics_of_Race_Philosophy_of_Science?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_8233573", "summary": "Abstract: The aim of this article is to develop an argument against metaphysical debates about the existence of\r\nhuman races.

"International Relations, as a discipline, does not grant race and racism explanatory agency in its conventional analyses, despite such issues being integral to the birth of the discipline. Race and Racism in International Relations seeks to remedy this oversight by acting as a catalyst for remembering, exposing and critically re-articulating the central importance of race and racism in International Relations.\r\n\r\nFocusing especially on the theoretical and political legacy of W.E.B. Du Bois\u2019s concept of the \"colour line\", the cutting edge contributions in this text provide an accessible entry point for both International Relations students and scholars into the literature and debates on race and racism by borrowing insights from disciplines such as history, anthropology and sociology where race and race theory figures more prominently; yet they also suggest that the field of IR is itself an intellectually and strategic field through which to further confront the global colour line.\r\n\r\nDrawing together a wide range of contributors, this much-needed text will be essential reading for students and scholars in a range of areas including Postcolonial studies, race/racism in world politics and international relations theory.\r\n\r\n1.

McCann argues that gangsta rap should be viewed as more than a damaging reinforcement of an era\u2019s worst racial stereotypes. Rather, he positions the works of key gangsta rap artists, as well as the controversies their work produced, squarely within the law-and-order politics and popular culture of the 1980s and 1990s to reveal a profoundly complex period in American history when the meanings of crime and criminality were incredibly unstable.\n \nAt the center of this era\u2014when politicians sought to prove their \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d credentials\u2014was the mark of criminality, a set of discourses that labeled members of predominantly poor, urban, and minority communities as threats to the social order. Through their use of the mark of criminality, public figures implemented extremely harsh penal polices that have helped make the United States the world\u2019s leading jailer of its adult population.\n \nAt the same time when politicians like Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton and television shows such as COPS and America\u2019s Most Wanted perpetuated images of gang and drug-filled ghettos, gangsta rap burst out of the hip-hop nation, emanating mainly from the predominantly black neighborhoods of South Central Los Angeles. Groups like NWA and solo artists (including Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Tupac Shakur) became millionaires by marketing the very discourses political and cultural leaders used to justify their war on crime. For these artists, the mark of criminality was a source of power, credibility, and revenue. By understanding gangsta rap as a potent, if deeply imperfect, enactment of the mark of criminality, we can better understand how crime is always a site of struggle over meaning. Furthermore, by underscoring the nimble rhetorical character of criminality, we can learn lessons that may inform efforts to challenge our nation\u2019s failed policies of mass incarceration.",

Rowling, John Tiffany, and Thorne himself. Set nineteen years in the future, the play introduces theatre into the Harry Potter universe, 1 though the Wizarding World of Harry Potter areas of Universal Studios theme parks have long featured live performances. While news from London's theatre district, the West End, rarely instigates an international cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, this announcement delighted and surprised Harry Potter fans around the world in its casting of Numa Dumezweni as the strong-willed female lead, Hermione Granger. An accomplished British actress born in Swaziland to South African parents, Dumezweni would become the second actress to portray Hermione following Emma Watson's star-making turn in the eight Harry Potter films produced by Warner Bros between 2001 and 2011. Unlike Watson, however, Dumezweni was black. The ensuing controversy provides a productive inroad into examining race in the world of Harry Potter, not only for the questions it raises about the authorship and ownership of popular texts, but also for the specific constraints and attendant cultures that come with media and its afterlife. Adapting a print text for the stage means entering a new medium and, in the process, a new culture of common practices and expectations, both of the artists and of the audience. This chapter explores these nuances to complicate our understanding of not only the decision to cast Dumezweni, but to further understand how race operates across the Harry Potter universe and media culture more broadly. Though I am a White critic, I ground my discussion of this controversy in the commentaries, critiques, and theories developed by scholars of color so that I might challenge received accounts of this evocative moment in Harry Potter fandom. I will examine this case study through three different lenses: the cultural differences between film and theatre as media and industries; the enduring debate over \" colorblind casting \" (hereafter, nontraditional casting) in the theatre, 2 in particular, but gradually more across media culture; and the increasingly visible tension between authorship and ownership of popular texts that takes places online in what Henry Jenkins has called \" convergence culture \" \u2014that is, to borrow from the subtitle of his landmark book, \" where old and new media collide. \" In so doing, I drawn upon and expand our understanding of race and media through a critical examination of the Harry Potter universe, the culture industries, and convergence culture. 1 I use \" the Harry Potter universe \" to encompass the world of Harry Potter, which includes the seven books, but also the supplemental books, films, online materials in Pottermore, theme park attractions, and other extensions that further develop the world in the spirit of transmedia storytelling, all under the supervision of J. K. Rowling. 2 Though \" colorblind casting \" is often used across the culture industries to discuss the practice of casting white roles or roles where race is not specified with actors of colors, I will use \" nontraditional casting \" because not only does it encompass casting practices beyond questions of race, but it conscientiously avoids the casual ableism of the term. I will only use the term hereafter when quoting others.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54512219, "asset_id": 34652166, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2427485, "first_name": "Peter C.", "last_name": "Kunze", "domain_name": "tulane", "page_name": "kunze", "display_name": "Peter C.

Brazil have become increasingly fraught in recent years as the once hegemonic concept of democracia racial continues to be subject to an ever more agnostic scrutiny. Parallel to these debates, and yet ultimately inseparable from them, is the question of what it is to be \u2018white\u2019. In this interdisciplinary paper, we argue that \u2018whiteness\u2019 has become increasingly sedimented in Brazilian public discourse as a naturalised category. And seeking a fresh perspective on what we perceive to have become a sterile debate, we examine Machado de Assis and his work to illustrate how assumptions surrounding his short story Pai contra M\u00e3e and indeed comments on the author\u2019s very body, reveal the extent to which \u2018whiteness\u2019 has come to be seen as non-negotiable and fixed. Placing a close reading of Machado\u2019s text at the heart of the article, we explain our reading\u2019s consequences for the scholarly debates now unfolding in Brazil as to the construction of \u2018whiteness\u2019. The article then develops ideas on \u2018whiteness\u2019 by pointing to the differences inherent between perspectives of \u2018race\u2019 as a process and perspectives of \u2018race\u2019 as a fixed and naturalized given.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32698352, "asset_id": 4224525, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 741106, "first_name": "Alex", "last_name": "Ungprateeb Flynn", "domain_name": "ucla", "page_name": "AlexUngprateebFlynn", "display_name": "Alex Ungprateeb Flynn", "profile_url": "https://ucla.academia.edu/AlexUngprateebFlynn?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/741106/252747/38639207/s65_alex.ungprateeb_flynn.jpeg"}, {"id": 453613, "first_name": "Elena", "last_name": "Calvo-Gonzalez", "domain_name": "ufba", "page_name": "ElenaCalvoGonzalez", "display_name": "Elena Calvo-Gonzalez", "profile_url": "https://ufba.academia.edu/ElenaCalvoGonzalez?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/453613/148148/17311887/s65_elena.calvo-gonzalez.jpg"}, {"id": 32944560, "first_name": "Marcelo", "last_name": "Mendes de Souza", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MarceloMendes21", "display_name": "Marcelo Mendes de Souza", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MarceloMendes21?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/32944560/11672434/13014672/s65_marcelo.mendes_de_souza.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 388, "name": "Latin American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2852, "name": "Narrative", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3827, "name": "Brazilian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brazilian_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 9821, "name": "Brazil", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brazil?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 33989, "name": "Machado de Assis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Machado_de_Assis?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 35572, "name": "Brazilian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brazilian_Literature?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 17308558, "title": "The Enigma of Diversity: The Language of Race and the Limits of Racial Justice by Ellen Berrey", "created_at": "2015-10-26T08:17:18.291-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/17308558/The_Enigma_of_Diversity_The_Language_of_Race_and_the_Limits_of_Racial_Justice_by_Ellen_Berrey?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_17308558", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39427039, "asset_id": 17308558, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 922567, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Luke", "domain_name": "umflint", "page_name": "DrDavidJLuke", "display_name": "David J Luke", "profile_url": "https://umflint.academia.edu/DrDavidJLuke?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/922567/3637503/80655917/s65_david.luke.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2613, "name": "Diversity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diversity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 11261077, "title": "Bonhoeffer's Black Jesus, by Reggie Williams (Baylor University Press, 2014)", "created_at": "2015-03-04T06:14:04.570-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11261077/Bonhoeffers_Black_Jesus_by_Reggie_Williams_Baylor_University_Press_2014_?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_11261077", "summary": "Reggie Williams provides a vivid primer on the christologies of key African American writers in the Harlem Renaissance as well as portraying the social conditions that surround the movement.

She was born in 1940 near Centreville, Miss., and she died in 2015 in Gloster, Miss. Surprisingly, little is known about her life beyond the publication of her book in 1968.\n\nHer book chronicles her life as a poor black girl growing up under harsh conditions during segregation in Mississippi. In vivid and sometimes heartbreaking details, she gives a riveting account of her personal experiences at a time when black people could be lynched for speaking their minds. Her writing is raw and graphic. She gives a shocking and gritty look at Mississippi\u2019s history. She writes of her struggle for civil rights and her prominent role in the movement. She also shares the stories of others who made sacrifices for freedom and justice.\n\nThis paper provides key moments and important dates in Moody\u2019s life history. It offers an overview of her life -- and events related to her story -- from 1940 to the present. The timeline will be updated periodically as new information becomes available.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nAuthor\u2019s Note:\n\nQuestions about the Anne Moody History Project may be directed to Roscoe Barnes III via email at doctorbarnes3@gmail.com or roscoebarnes3@yahoo.com For updates on Anne Moody history and the on-going work of this community service project, please follow AMHP on Twitter (@AnneMoodyHP).

This historic run was controversial, in part, because both championship rounds were won on the Affirmative using the Kritik; it accelerated the spread of Kritikal arguments about race and the de-centering of the Plan-Focus Model. While affirming herculean efforts to develop the Kritik as a valid form of argument when positioned as the adversary of the Plan-Focus Model, Uniting the Crowns also exposed a gap in the literature about Kritikal debate. There is no academic defense of a formal model of debate that puts the Kritik at the center of an adversarial mode of competition despite similarly hardfought opposition from detractors. Proponents of the Kritik respectfully disagree on strategic use of Kritikal arguments but there is near-universal agreement that the value of the Kritik is in creating opportunities for necessary conversations about critical and cultural issues. In order to establish a defense of a Kritik-Focus Model I will collect qualitative data during interviews with coaches and alumni of Cross Examination debate who have gone on to become public advocates, activists, lawyers, and policy wonks invested in the future of the activity.

The author argues that the decision to take gender identity protections out of the 2007 ENDA should be understood as part of the wider record of compromises and alterations made to the bill, which must be contextualized alongside the move within the national mainstream gay and lesbian movement toward homonormative politics and strategies.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31650613, "asset_id": 4139911, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4998673, "first_name": "Elias", "last_name": "Vitulli", "domain_name": "independentscholar", "page_name": "EliasVitulli", "display_name": "Elias Vitulli", "profile_url": "https://independentscholar.academia.edu/EliasVitulli?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4998673/2174946/2812210/s65_elias.vitulli.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 699, "name": "Queer Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2624, "name": "Transgender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transgender_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3114, "name": "Queer Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Theory?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6667, "name": "LGBT Issues", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LGBT_Issues?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 57936771, "title": "The Movement for Black Lives: Philosophical Perspectives", "created_at": "2021-10-14T17:36:34.251-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/57936771/The_Movement_for_Black_Lives_Philosophical_Perspectives?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_57936771", "summary": "The Movement for Black Lives: Philosophical Perspectives brings philosophical analysis to bear on the aims, strategies, policy positions, and intellectual-historical context of M4BL.

Several scholars have examined the effects of gender on cyberbullying with mixed results.  Little research has considered the effects of race and sexuality, and analyzing these demographic characteristics individually (i.e., non-interactively) provides a limited view of the influences of race, gender, and sexuality on cybervictimization.  Accordingly, we employ an intersectional approach that captures more fully the nuances between cyberbullying and social location. For example, given the centrality of race in American society, it is surprising that the research on cyberbullying among adolescents finds little evidence of a \u201crace effect.\u201d We hypothesize that racial identity moderates the degree to which cybervictimization rates vary by gender and sexuality. Evidence from an original survey of students in a Midwestern High School (N = 752) lends qualified support to our conditional hypotheses: the relationship between gender and victimization is stronger for white students than it is for students of color, but there are no racial differences in the impact of a student\u2019s sexuality and his or her experiences with cyberbullying.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37984575, "asset_id": 11787133, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4081510, "first_name": "Ray", "last_name": "Block", "domain_name": "uwlax", "page_name": "RayBlock", "display_name": "Ray Block", "profile_url": "https://uwlax.academia.edu/RayBlock?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4081510/1569256/12398492/s65_ray.block.jpg"}, {"id": 29072898, "first_name": "Laurie Cooper", "last_name": "Stoll", "domain_name": "uwlax", "page_name": "LaurieCooperStoll", "display_name": "Laurie Cooper Stoll", "profile_url": "https://uwlax.academia.edu/LaurieCooperStoll?f_ri=5453", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4714, "name": "Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexuality?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34327, "name": "Intersectionality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 106344, "name": "Cyber Bullying", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Bullying?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 171507, "name": "Adolescentes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Adolescentes?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 8206883, "title": "\u201cAchaemenids, Royal Power and Persian Ethnicity.\u201d In J.

The case of the Ch \u0301ol ejido, or communal land holding, of Tila reached Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court in 2010. Yet five years later, tired of the excruciatingly slow pace of the judicial apparatus, Ch \u0301ol ejido authorities rendered their own verdict by way of an assembly decision that reclaimed the 130 hectares under dispute as their own. This para- state legal verdict unsettled the pre-ascribed role of different political actors\u2014the state judicial apparatus, human rights organizations, and anthropologists\u2014whose interplay grants certain cohesion and sediment to the current judicial arena in the country when indigenous communities are implicated. The assembly decision and subsequent actions in the ejido Tila displaced these actors, including the Supreme Court judges, and in doing so rendered visible the racialized hierarchies that neither human rights organizations nor anthropologists were effectively able to subvert.

This paper presents an ethnographic study of everyday nation-making at Castro Middle School, located in a city transformed by immigration. Building on prior theories of bi-directional assimilation, which assumes both mainstream institutions and immigrants undergo ethnic change and become more alike, I show how assimilation can produce new definitions of Americanness that are more recognizable to immigrant communities, facilitating their national identification. At Castro, bi-directional assimilation between the school and African American students supported their description of Americans in multicultural terms and their own identification as American. However, assimilation between the school and the larger Latino and Asian student populations was limited due to a black/white racial binary paradigm that excluded them from the national community. This study thus importantly nuances the role of race as a barrier in the assimilation process, particularly as it unfolds in schools.

While other studies have examined the experiences of Muslim and other racialized youths' experiences with racism in secondary schools, this study uniquely examines the experiences of Muslim teachers who work in these institutions. The findings of this study indicate that teachers' experiences with anti-Muslim sentiment appear to be connected to wider discourses surrounding both the War on Terror in the North American context as well as to domestic Quebec state policies and nationalist debates.This inquiry is relevant as it contributes to a greater understanding of Muslim teacher experiences of race and racism and suggests a potential connection between these teachers' experiences and other research highlighting Muslims' post-911 experiences.

Gramsci\u2019s perspective as a Southern migrant to the Italian north enables him to read Italy\u2019s movement landscape in terms of core-periphery relationships and migration, an approach which can also fruitfully be used to understand the particularities of Irish social movements. \n\nIn historical terms, the Irish analogy to the Sardinia-Turin relationship which Gramsci theorised is one in which the core is not Dublin but Birmingham or Boston, meaning that it becomes important to consider the organising activity of the Irish abroad (both in terms of ethnic closure, right-wing Catholicism and in some contexts racism but also in terms of those who became active outside these community structures, often on the left and in the labour movement) and the impact on Irish movements of the Irish diaspora. Furthermore, in the period of ethnic closure from the later 19th century until the 1990s Irish community structure has been such that \u201cblow-ins\u201d (outsiders), whether from elsewhere in Ireland or from Northern societies (in what was until recently a semi-peripheral context) played a disproportionate role in most social movements, NGOs and community organising. In some contexts this remains true today.\n\nThe analysis of immigrant self-organising in Ireland starts from noting that the bulk of immigration has taken place within the last two decades, with significant choices being made for many at the onset of the economic crisis. As immigration does not follow previous colonial relationships, migrant populations are extremely heterogenous and for most individual ethnicities small in absolute terms. Hence much effort is still directed towards building informal support networks, community centres, Saturday language schools, religious venues etc., while political orientations are often shaped strongly by those acquired prior to migration and long-distance nationalisms are significant in many cases.  Similarly, there is still a largely Irish-dominated NGO sector geared to providing services for migrants in line with state and EU funding policies. Given this, the context of Ireland\u2019s recent history of social partnership and a broader political culture of clientelism, migrant movements have to decide their political orientation at an early stage: whether to tailor their demands to what mainstream political allies present as acceptable and attainable goals in a context of widespread racism, or to test the distinctly colder waters of autonomous self-organising on their own terms.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42924356, "asset_id": 22275139, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 572972, "first_name": "Laurence", "last_name": "Cox", "domain_name": "nuim", "page_name": "DrLaurenceCox", "display_name": "Laurence Cox", "profile_url": "https://nuim.academia.edu/DrLaurenceCox?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/572972/394311/48598285/s65_laurence.cox.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 208, "name": "Social Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Movements?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 386, "name": "Irish Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3375, "name": "Self-Organization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self-Organization?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3843, "name": "Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 8004, "name": "Resistance (Social)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Resistance_Social_?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14834, "name": "Gramsci", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gramsci?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 47830, "name": "Solidarity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Solidarity?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 21877505, "title": "Undocumented Fears: Immigration and the Politics of Divide and Conquer in Hazleton, Pennsylvania", "created_at": "2016-02-12T07:13:22.049-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/21877505/Undocumented_Fears_Immigration_and_the_Politics_of_Divide_and_Conquer_in_Hazleton_Pennsylvania?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_21877505", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44070035, "asset_id": 21877505, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3260640, "first_name": "Jamie", "last_name": "Longazel", "domain_name": "johnjay", "page_name": "JamieLongazel", "display_name": "Jamie Longazel", "profile_url": "https://johnjay.academia.edu/JamieLongazel?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3260640/18603296/18568431/s65_jamie.longazel.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 189, "name": "Criminology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3392, "name": "Critical Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Pedagogy?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3767, "name": "Law and Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_and_Society?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3843, "name": "Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 20803125, "title": "Intervening in the Media's Influence on Stereotypes of Race and Ethnicity: The Role of Media Literacy Education", "created_at": "2016-01-25T14:21:50.780-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/20803125/Intervening_in_the_Medias_Influence_on_Stereotypes_of_Race_and_Ethnicity_The_Role_of_Media_Literacy_Education?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_20803125", "summary": "This article provides a review of the research record on the potential for media literacy education to intervene in the media's influence on racial and ethnic stereotypes, and explores the theoretical concepts that underlie these efforts.

Quantitative research on the effect of media literacy training and mediated counterstereotypes on reducing racial/ethnic prejudice is described. In addition, we report qualitative data from an ongoing study of early adolescents who took part in a media literacy curriculum on stereotypes. The research record reveals that although the topic is severely understudied, media literacy education holds great promise for its ability to shape media-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors and encourage an active and critical stance toward media. Media have been shown to have the potential to promote or to call into question stereotypical views of social groups, including those defined by race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual identity (Mastro, 2015; Tukachinsky, Mastro, & Yarchi, 2015). Accordingly, there is promise for education efforts addressing the media's role in stereotyping to mitigate the effects of exposure to negative or narrow media depictions of social groups and possibly even enhance the positive media influence of exposure to nonstereotypical and favorable media depictions.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 41570667, "asset_id": 20803125, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 32744256, "first_name": "Erica", "last_name": "Scharrer", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "EricaScharrer", "display_name": "Erica Scharrer", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/EricaScharrer?f_ri=5453", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 207490, "first_name": "Srividya", "last_name": "Ramasubramanian", "domain_name": "tamu", "page_name": "SrividyaRamasubramanian", "display_name": "Srividya Ramasubramanian", "profile_url": "https://tamu.academia.edu/SrividyaRamasubramanian?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/207490/48225/12697104/s65_srividya.ramasubramanian.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 928, "name": "Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6245, "name": "Stereotypes and Prejudice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stereotypes_and_Prejudice?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8280, "name": "Media Literacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Literacy?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15735, "name": "Media Literacy Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Literacy_Education?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 774876, "name": "Prejudice Reduction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prejudice_Reduction?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 20040750, "title": "\u201cWe are all children of God\u201d: a Charismatic church as space of encounter between township and suburb in post-apartheid Johannesburg,", "created_at": "2016-01-05T09:27:50.648-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/20040750/_We_are_all_children_of_God_a_Charismatic_church_as_space_of_encounter_between_township_and_suburb_in_post_apartheid_Johannesburg_?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_20040750", "summary": "20 years after the first democratic elections in South Africa the urban society in Johannesburg is still marked by the legacy of apartheid which makes it difficult for residents of former township areas and members of suburban middle classes to encounter each other in everyday life.

Warren County, North Carolina is credited as the birthplace of the US environmental justice movement for 1982 landmark protests linking environmental concerns with civil rights organising. Our 2012 short film, Remembering Kearneytown, looks at this significant environmental history through the perspective of co-author Rev. Kearney, assistant pastor at a church nearby Warren County's iconic former toxic landfill. In the film, Rev. Kearney calls for his community to reclaim their legacy of environmental justice and re-imagine Warren County as a model of health rather than waste.

Comparing the perceptions and experiences of 14 white male youth with 8 Native American, 4 black, and 4 Latino participants, white privilege was reflected in responses involving perceptions of the self as a \u2018criminal\u2019. Youth of all races described the effect of correctional facilities on their self-identification as a \u2018criminal\u2019 and youth of color were more likely than white youth to report the feeling that other community members viewed them as criminal before and after being arrested. Overall these findings demonstrate the \u2018clean slate\u2019 that white youth begin with compared to youth of color. Ultimately, time spent in a correctional facility appears to liken white youth\u2019s perception of themselves as criminals to the self-identification of youth of color. Policy implications include implementing alternatives to incarceration, such as community service requirements to reintegrate youth into the community and avoid the negative effect of incarceration on the identities of juveniles. For youth of color, reducing racial discrimination is necessary to end the self-fulfilling prophecy and the sense of being labeled a criminal by the community prior to incarceration.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38003228, "asset_id": 13281734, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 895548, "first_name": "Rachel", "last_name": "Feinstein", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "FeinsteinRachel", "display_name": "Rachel Feinstein", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/FeinsteinRachel?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/895548/1328048/1971903/s65_rachel.feinstein.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 31048, "name": "White Privilege", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/White_Privilege?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 158625, "name": "Juveniles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Juveniles?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 13171960, "title": "U.S. ethnic minorities' attitudes towards Whites: The role of shared reality theory in intergroup relations", "created_at": "2015-06-22T05:12:51.375-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/13171960/U_S_ethnic_minorities_attitudes_towards_Whites_The_role_of_shared_reality_theory_in_intergroup_relations?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_13171960", "summary": "In the current research, we suggest that shared reality, the belief that one per-ceives the world the same way as another group, can predict attitudes to-wards that group.

Drawing on the idiom of coproduction, it tries to examine how the two concepts were used to justify and promote Japan's colonial efforts in East Asia. Works on Japanese scholarship in the context of colonialism will be discussed. By viewing race and tehnicity as coproduced concepts, these works will be revisited and put in context. Furthermore, literature about  Mansh\u016bkoku from pre-war and wartime Japan will be examined to further supplement the discussion with further insights. The main contributions of this paper are the view of race and ethnicity as coproduced concepts, which were used in different ways: On the one hand, race served as a \"unifying element\" to argue for the unity of the East Asian peoples. On the other hand, ethnicity was used to construct the image of a culturally \"superior\" Japanese ethnicity, entitled to lead other East Asian nations to \"enlightenment\".",

Firstly, some non-citizen Kurds have \u2018benefitted\u2019 from the exceptional naturalization brought in as a reconciliatory reform by the current regime during the Revolution\u2019s early stages. Secondly, the transformation of state identity, which is presently being negotiated between Islamists, secularists and Arab nationalists etc, not only impacts upon citizen-state relations, but also determines the position of both stateless and citizen Kurds. Drawing on fieldwork conducted with stateless Kurds, both in Syria and displaced in neighbouring countries, this paper argues that not only is access to citizenship being transformed, but so too is the very definition of being a citizen.

In this article the authors examine the pivotal role of the university sector in addressing this inequity and releasing the potential for increased Indigenous enrolment, participation and completion in higher education. Indigenous higher education, they argue, is core university business, not an equity issue, and a unique opportunity currently exists for achieving significant progress. Using examples of best practice they show how universities can take positive practical steps to overcome the commonly identified barriers to Indigenous higher education success. These examples include Indigenous centres and units to assist and support Indigenous students. The authors also propose four specific strategies for increasing Indigenous higher education success across all facets. These are: the recruitment of highly dedicated staff; to optimise the degree of comfort, cultural and academic, of beginning students; the role and centrality of Indigenous centres in Indigenous higher education needs to be recognised and strengthened; and to keep the institutions' Indigenous support mechanisms constantly under review. The authors extend their analysis to the low Indigenous representation among university staff, arguing that a greater presence and nurturing of Indigenous staff, academic and general is a vital facet of improving Indigenous higher education access and success. Finally, they argue that a longitudinal study of Indigenous higher education participation is needed to provide an evidence base to inform and increase the efficacy of policy in this area.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31280460, "asset_id": 3572923, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4241112, "first_name": "Maggie", "last_name": "Walter", "domain_name": "utas", "page_name": "MaggieWalter", "display_name": "Maggie Walter", "profile_url": "https://utas.academia.edu/MaggieWalter?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4241112/1984755/2343640/s65_maggie.walter.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 975, "name": "Sex and Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sex_and_Gender?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2621, "name": "Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Higher_Education?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3073, "name": "Indigenous education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_education?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5273, "name": "Class", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Class?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 8331, "name": "Indigenous Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Knowledge?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 25212, "name": "Higher Education Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Higher_Education_Policy?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 25474, "name": "Aboriginal education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_education?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 204972, "name": "Indigenous Higher Education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Higher_Education_policy?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 297702, "name": "Indigenous education in higher education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_education_in_higher_education?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 364234, "name": "Indigenous education, universities, governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_education_universities_governance?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 61070342, "title": "Los Angeles\u2019s Indoor Swap Meet Boom and the Creation of a Multiethnic Retailscape", "created_at": "2021-11-05T13:37:07.291-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/61070342/Los_Angeles_s_Indoor_Swap_Meet_Boom_and_the_Creation_of_a_Multiethnic_Retailscape?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_61070342", "summary": "Indoor swap meets proliferated within metropolitan Los Angeles's rapidly diversifying inner suburbs throughout the 1980s and 1990s, transforming onetime retail and industrial buildings into multitenant vendor markets. Relying on architectural and programmatic theming to attract Latinx shoppers, many swap meet managers built market environments that resembled Mexican mercados and tianguis. While some urbanists have interpreted these markets as sites of \"Latino Urbanism,\" their Korean ownership, large cohorts of Asian vendors and Black shoppers, and ties to Asian banking and garment industries complicate these narratives. Tracing the origins of this Korean-dominated business niche through case studies in Koreatown, Lynwood, South Los Angeles, and Anaheim, this article illustrates how shoppers and vendors used swap meets' non-White social environments to negotiate class and social differences.

In doing so, I will offer an account of the dialectical interplay of theory, method and data. Moreover, I will throw light on the way in which my research design evolved during the course of this study, thus demonstrating the ways in which it, and the decisions taken once in 'the field', were shaped by my personal biography and sociological training, as well as a range of other institutional, political, cultural and ethical factors. In doing so, I will draw attention to the significance of whiteness and class when negotiating the contours of the local 'communicative community' (Hewitt, 2005) through three overlapping periods of data collection on my journey towards a political ethnographic study of the BNP in the outer-East London Borough of Barking and Dagenham. I then conclude with a discussion which addresses a criticism that I (and others) have faced while presenting their work in this area: namely, that there is no place for ethnographic academic research involving the far right. Drawing on Back's (2002) concept of 'active listening', I will suggest that there is an important role for anti-racist, anti-fascist activist-scholarship in a field largely dominated by white people, and often susceptible to the pitfalls of 'white logic' and 'white methods' (see Zuberi and Bonilla-Silva, 2008).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65215280, "asset_id": 44731091, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8637937, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Ashe", "domain_name": "durham", "page_name": "StephenAshe", "display_name": "Stephen D Ashe", "profile_url": "https://durham.academia.edu/StephenAshe?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8637937/31433826/28855698/s65_stephen.ashe.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 201, "name": "Political Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Sociology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 814, "name": "Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethics?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1230, "name": "Social Research Methods and Methodology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Research_Methods_and_Methodology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2504, "name": "Research Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Research_Ethics?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3285, "name": "Qualitative Methods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qualitative_Methods?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5847, "name": "Political Extremism/Radicalism/Populism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Extremism_Radicalism_Populism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 7402, "name": "Populism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Populism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 11639, "name": "Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 12135, "name": "Qualitative Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qualitative_Research?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 26879, "name": "Social Class", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Class?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 41028, "name": "Extreme Right", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Extreme_Right?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 89524, "name": "Right-Wing Extremism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Right-Wing_Extremism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 107620, "name": "Far Right", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Far_Right?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 234667, "name": "Far-right parties in Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Far-right_parties_in_Europe?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 44498762, "title": "Admirer en fermant les yeux : la r\u00e9ception critique de l\u2019oeuvre de F.

Holland Day in Paris in 1901\r\n\r\nA key figure of the studies dedicated to the homoerotic photograph, American pictorialist F. Holland Day (1864-1933) patiently built a poetic world inhabited by obviously sensual male nudes. Yet, the critical reception of his work by his contemporaries shows no acknowledgment of this sensuality no more than it takes into account his taste for the nude. The \u201cExhibition of the Work of F. Holland Day and the American New School\u201d, shown in Paris in 1901, reveals the paralysis of the critics when confronted to the unusual eroticism of Day\u2019s nonstandard aesthetic. Despite its obviousness, his constant fascination for the male body is thoroughly ignored. Examining the critical reception of the Parisian exhibition of 1901, this article aims to study the willful blindness of the critics and the way Day\u2019s contemporaries completely overlooked the sensuality and homoeroticism of his photographs to refocus the debate on the more conventional characteristics of his work, thus denying it one of its main specific features.\r\n\r\nFigure incontournable des \u00e9tudes consacr\u00e9es \u00e0 la photographie homo\u00e9rotique, le pictorialiste am\u00e9ricain F.

explores representations of girls in current discourses of neoliberal development through an analysis of a range of texts that promote the global Girl Effect movement. These representations are situated in the context of theoretical debates about gender mainstreaming and policy developments that construct girls and women's 'empowerment' as 'smart economics'. The paper draws on postcolonial and transnational feminist analyses that critique market-led approaches to development and their complicities in the dynamics of neo-colonialism and uneven development, to contextualise the Girl Effect movement. It is argued that the Girl Effect movement draws on colonial stereotypes of girls as sexually and culturally constrained, but reworks these through the discourses of neoliberal development to construct girls as good investment potential. In doing so, it reproduces a dominant narrative that highlights the cultural causes of poverty but obscures structural relations of exploitation and privilege.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31731733, "asset_id": 3702588, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1401815, "first_name": "Farzana", "last_name": "Shain", "domain_name": "goldsmiths", "page_name": "FarzanaShain", "display_name": "Farzana Shain", "profile_url": "https://goldsmiths.academia.edu/FarzanaShain?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1401815/998192/35245269/s65_farzana.shain.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 199, "name": "Media Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Sociology?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 975, "name": "Sex and Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sex_and_Gender?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2585, "name": "International Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Development?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 3392, "name": "Critical Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Pedagogy?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5273, "name": "Class", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Class?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 12471, "name": "Violence Against Women", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Violence_Against_Women?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 13518, "name": "Gender and Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Development?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 14843, "name": "Latin American social movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_social_movements?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 18826, "name": "Girlhood Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Girlhood_Studies?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 19231, "name": "Race and ethnicity (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_ethnicity_Anthropology_?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 20605, "name": "Gender and education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_education?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 23305, "name": "Transnational Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_Feminism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 30010, "name": "Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Empire?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 98660, "name": "Community Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Education?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 143132, "name": "Girls Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Girls_Education?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 711050, "name": "Postcolonial feminisms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_feminisms?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 993926, "name": "Human Rights and Social Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights_and_Social_Justice-1?f_ri=5453"}, {"id": 1191266, "name": "Resistance Formation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Resistance_Formation?f_ri=5453"}]}, {"id": 70414737, "title": "Affect, Black Rage, and False Alternatives in the Hip-Hop Nation", "created_at": "2022-02-04T05:06:24.805-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/70414737/Affect_Black_Rage_and_False_Alternatives_in_the_Hip_Hop_Nation?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_70414737", "summary": "This essay looks to the work of iconic rap artist Tupac Shakur to illuminate the role of Black rage as a common denominator between rap\u2019s most conscious and gangsta iterations.

Being, English professor Christina Sharpe draws examples from visual culture, literature, and postcolonial theorists to provide quotidian representations of Black lives. Her book accounts for both Black suffering and modes of disruptions that counter subjected Black deaths and the menacing conditions in which these catastrophes are produced. The book is divided into four interconnected chapters that correspond to four metaphors-the wake, the ship, the hold, and the weather-through which she theorizes how modes of Black subjection continue to haunt Black lives in the diaspora. Sharpe not only breaks free from the confinement of time and space in thinking through being Black, both in and out of the United States, via the metaphors she uses, but Sharpe also creates an intimate and effectual approach towards the current issues of Black subjection by connecting with the readers on a personal level. In the Wake: On Blackness and Being is a critical addition to Black studies offering a new language and form for understanding Black being in diaspora. Sharpe uses the metaphors as part of that language and form. Through their semiotic significations, she seamlessly connects the past and the present, the history of Black slavery, and the \"afterlives of properties.\" The wake is the path left behind by the moving ship, and \"the afterlife of slavery\" (Sharpe borrows this turn of phrase from Saidiya Hartman). To be in the wake is to be aware of the impact of Black slavery as it continues to shape contemporary Black being, to keep watch with the dead, and to inhibit a Blackened consciousness. One of the strengths of Sharpe's book lies in the ways in which she approaches the concept of \"wake work.\" She sees it not only as a location of cultural, literal, and artistic production, resilience, and consciousness that mourn Black deaths, but also as a method of care. Sharpe insists that \"thinking needs care,\" and that individual and communal forms of care need to stay in the wake in order to care for the dead and the living in the afterlife of slavery.

Via de analyse van cijfermateriaal aangeleverd door de provincie West-Vlaanderen, Unia en Statistiek Vlaanderen werd duidelijk dat Bruggelingen met een migratieachtergrond minder kans hebben eigenaar te zijn van een woning, meer kans hebben om niet-werkend werkzoekende te zijn en procentueel meer tewerkgesteld zijn in een lage dagloonklasse dan Bruggelingen zonder migratieachtergrond. Daarnaast is de kans op schoolse vertraging bij deze groep groter en zijn ze verhoudingsgewijs minder vertegenwoordigd in het hoger onderwijs. Via zeventien semigestructureerde interviews met sleutelfiguren uit Brugse stadsdiensten en organisaties, aangevuld met een focusgroep met leden van Platform De Bruggelink, werden factoren in kaart gebracht die deze herkomstkloof be\u00efnvloeden. Daarnaast werd onderzocht over welke initiatieven die deze kloof zouden kunnen overbruggen consensus is. Het onderzoek vormt zodoende een startpunt voor de opmaak van een gedragen actieplan die deze doelstelling wil verwezenlijken.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61966436, "asset_id": 41827736, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 131808407, "first_name": "pieter", "last_name": "callewaert", "domain_name": "ugent", "page_name": "pcallewaert", "display_name": "pieter callewaert", "profile_url": "https://ugent.academia.edu/pcallewaert?f_ri=5453", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/131808407/38041790/31971691/s65_pieter.callewaert.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2613, "name": "Diversity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diversity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27879, "name": "Racial and ethnic discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_and_ethnic_discrimination?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 159181, "name": "Equality and Non Discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Equality_and_Non_Discrimination?f_ri=5453", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 2402090, "title": "Real Social Science: Applied Phronesis", "created_at": "2013-01-15T00:02:16.905-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2402090/Real_Social_Science_Applied_Phronesis?f_ri=5453", "dom_id": "work_2402090", "summary": "Back cover text: Real Social Science presents a new, hands-on approach to social inquiry.

The reflexive analysis of values and power gives new meaning to the impact of research on policy and practice. Real Social Science is a major step forward in a novel and thriving field of research.
