"dom_id": "work_42279148", "summary": "This article outlines the spread of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed religion (known in Chinese as Datong jiao \u5927\u540c\u6559) in Republican China (1912-1949), as a form of religious cosmopolitanism that originated in Iran, whose spread to China can be traced to links with the Ottoman Empire, British Palestine, the United States and Japan. By tracking the individuals, connections and events through which knowledge of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed movement spread in China, our study reveals an overlapping nexus of networks that shared cosmopolitan ideals: intellectual reformers, liberal Christians, Esperantists, Confucian modernizers, redemptive society activists, and socialists. The Bah\u00e1'\u00ed connections serve as a thread that sheds light on a unique 'cosmopolitan moment' in Republican China, hitherto largely ignored in the scholarly literature on this period, which has focused primarily on the growth of modern Chinese nationalism. Leading nationalist figures endorsed these movements, showing that nationalism and cosmopolitanism were seen as expressions of the same ideal of world community, at a specific juncture of Asian colonial modernity. Through this case, we argue that the sociology of cosmopolitanism should attend to non-secular and non-state movements advocating utopian visions of cosmopolitanism, map the circulations that form a nexus of such groups, and identify the contextual dynamics that produce 'cosmopolitan moments' at specific historical junctures and locations.

"This article examines indigenous women wrestlers (luchadoras) in La Paz, Bolivia, and the ways in which they creatively use tourists\u2019 assumptions that they are \u201ctraditional\u201d peoples performing in \u201cexotic\u201d events. Since 2001, indigenous women have participated in lucha libre\u2014a form of wrestling that draws its lineage from wrestling in Mexico and the United States. Travelers often assume it represents a traditional form, however, because the luchadoras base their wrestling personas and costuming on chola market women. I explore how the luchadoras utilize these perceptions and the resulting media attention to claim cosmopolitan identities. Not only do they gain social status and mobility, but they also see themselves as positive representatives of Bolivian women for a global audience.\r\n\r\nEste art\u00edculo examina las mujeres luchadoras en La Paz, Bolivia, y c\u00f3mo \u00e9stas usan creativamente los supuestos por parte de los turistas de ser \u201ctradicionales\u201d y de que est\u00e1n actuando en eventos \u201cex\u00f3ticos.\u201d Desde 2001, mujeres ind\u00edgenas participan en la lucha libre \u2014una forma de lucha procedente de M\u00e9xico y los Estados Unidos. Sin embargo, los viajeros, a menudo, asumen que es una tradici\u00f3n porque las luchadoras se presentan con los trajes de las cholas vendedoras. En este art\u00edculo exploro c\u00f3mo las luchadoras utilizan esas percepciones y la atenci\u00f3n resultante de los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n para reclamar identidades cosmopolitas. Con ello no solo mejoran su posici\u00f3n y ganan movilidad social, sino tambi\u00e9n se ven a s\u00ed mismas como representantes de las mujeres bolivianas ante un p\u00fablico global.",

article, I explore a range of actually existing cosmopolitanisms performed by young people studying at a private higher educational institute in Singapore. Drawing on fieldwork over a period of eleven months conducted with these educated but non-elite youths between 2013 and 2014, I discuss how private degree students (a vernacular term) draw on various resources across different sites and domains of their everyday life to construct themselves, as well as their campus experiences, as \u2018cosmopolitan\u2019. Adopting an understanding of cosmopolitanism as a social practice, I argue that these young people perform three criss-crossing pathways to become cosmopolitan that unsettle dominant conceptions of cosmopolitanism as an elite cultural capital, disposition, and subjecthood within extant scholarship on international/transnational education. In particular, I explore these pathways through the framing themes of \u2018rooted cosmopolitanism\u2019, \u2018cosmopolitan learning\u2019, and \u2018unanticipated cosmopolitan\u2019.

Instead, our research subjects consist of self-initiated expatriates, or \u2018middling transnationals\u2019, who have chosen to prioritize immersion in the language and culture of China by sending their children to local schools. This localized, or Sinocentric, model exposes non-Chinese children to a challenging and nationalistic Chinese curriculum. Our analysis of these practices as a form of cosmopolitan education challenges both the goal of teaching a universal and placeless ethical cosmopolitanism and the assumption that a meaningful cosmopolitan education must take place in the idealized setting of a liberal cosmopolitan school system. We also highlight the difficulties families face in this approach, describing this as an \u2018entangled cosmopolitanism\u2019, an enriching but uncomfortable engagement with both local and home-country educational cultures.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35432951, "asset_id": 9145354, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37716, "first_name": "James", "last_name": "Farrer", "domain_name": "sophia", "page_name": "JamesFarrer", "display_name": "James Farrer", "profile_url": "https://sophia.academia.edu/JamesFarrer?f_ri=952760", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/37716/139011/104714857/s65_james.farrer.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=952760", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=952760", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=952760", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 974, "name": "Sociology of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Education?f_ri=952760", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=952760"}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=952760"}, {"id": 5035, "name": "Comparative & International Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_and_International_Education?f_ri=952760"}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=952760"}, {"id": 9578, "name": "Cosmopolitan Urbanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Urbanism?f_ri=952760"}, {"id": 12108, "name": "China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China?f_ri=952760"}, {"id": 45472, "name": "Expatriates", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Expatriates?f_ri=952760"}, {"id": 62336, "name": "Kwame Anthony Appiah", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kwame_Anthony_Appiah?f_ri=952760"}, {"id": 105797, "name": "Third Culture Kids", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Third_Culture_Kids?f_ri=952760"}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=952760"}, {"id": 204571, "name": "Shanghai Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shanghai_Urban_Studies?f_ri=952760"}, {"id": 391206, "name": "Education in China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_in_China?f_ri=952760"}, {"id": 952760, "name": "Actually Existing Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Actually_Existing_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=952760"}, {"id": 986275, "name": "Cosmopolitan Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Citizenship?f_ri=952760"}]}, {"id": 6053585, "title": "(2014) Mobile mediators and inbetweener importers: The normalization of strangeness in Muslim Southeast Asia.

Most contemporary commentators have concurred that cosmopolitanism as a form of ethical practice is associated with a conscious openness to the world and the potential for a relational dialogue with people and things that are culturally different (Delanty, 2009; Hannerz, 1990; Thompson and Tambyah, 1999). The cosmopolitanism question is essentially whether or not people develop feelings of solidarity and responsibility for widening circles of strangers, seek to understand and be changed by incorporating others\u2019 viewpoints and practices which are apparently unlike their own, and feel responsible for environments far away from them (Appiah, 2007; Cheah, 2006; Stevenson, 2002). \n\nWhile researchers currently grapple with the abstract philosophical dimensions of the concept, they also seek to understand how everyday, vernacular forms of cosmopolitanism work, and how people acquire and learn cosmopolitan competencies and habits (Woodward and Skrbis, 2013). In this context, it is not an exaggeration to observe that consumption opportunities and practices constitute a large part of people\u2019s engagements with diversity and cultural difference (Germann Molz, 2011). But, in what ways does this consumption matter to diffusing cosmopolitan cultures, and in what ways might it complicate them, or even deform them? And, in what ways can scholarship from diverse disciplinary perspectives work with each other to shed light on these questions? \n\nThe purpose of this book is to examine the consequences of cosmopolitan ideals and cosmopolitanisation processes for consumption and market practices on a global scale. By discussing not only the positive side of cosmopolitanism but also the problems and challenges related to it, this book takes an informed, critical look at issues and practices of cosmopolitan consumption and markets. The goals of the book are to: \n\u2022\tproduce a collected work of high scholarly quality that has an enduring impact on the way researchers understand and conceptualise the cosmopolitan possibilities of consumption \n\u2022\tbe the first major collection to frame and directly address controversies and questions around the relationship between consumption and cosmopolitan

"This article is based on a study of The Reluctant Fundamentalist (2007), a novel by a Pakistani writer Mohsin Hamid. The novel is based on the story of transformation of an expat Pakistani living in New York from a true cosmopolitan to a nationalist. The article will explore the crisis of identity suffered by the protagonist in a new land where he reached as an immigrant student and worker. However, he experienced a resurgence of nationalist and patriotic sentiments within him as 9/ 11 happened in 2001. The force of American nationalism that was imperial in nature, resulting in the invasion of Afghanistan and Iran, triggered resentment in the protagonist who decided to leave America and went back to the country of his origin, Pakistan. During his stay in America, the protagonist\r\nredefined fundamentalism as an imperial tendency in the American system while rejecting the accusations hurled towards him of an Islamic fundamentalist. The article will explain that there is a loss of cosmopolitan virtue in the post 9/11 era and the dream of universal peace and harmony is shattered due to unbridled state ambitions to invade foreign territories. The article will conclude with the assertion that the loss of cosmopolitanism and reassertion of national identities give way to confrontation and intolerance destroying the prospects of peace and harmony in a globalized world.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36368811, "asset_id": 10290444, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3042463,

I pay special attention to the human (im)mobilities mediating these processes. This critical thinking exercise confirms that the relationship between place, collective identity and socio-cultural processes of identification is a contested aspect of social theory. In the discussion, I suggest four points to be addressed in the future if we want to make existing theories about post-national formations and processes of cosmopolitanization more robust against the huge and complex challenges humankind is facing.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65403606, "asset_id": 44887160, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2278, "first_name": "Noel B.", "last_name": "Salazar", "domain_name": "kuleuven", "page_name": "NoelBSalazar", "display_name": "Noel B.
