A Study of Selected Headhunting Rites on Southern Cordillera Northern Luzon.\u201d (Arsenio Nicolas, University of the Philippines, 1989). It will feature pictures and videos which were not available then. Headhunting (also called headtaking, headcutting) in Northern Luzon, Philippines was a ritual act, and cosmological in nature. A head was required before rice planting began and after a successful harvest. It was also used to acquire a certain life force emanating from the victim's head, offered to a esteemed person before his death chair. The headhunting ritual complex was maintained by a complex system --- a dry rice and a wet rice agricultural system, trade relations with friendly villages and with the lowlands, kin and village alliances which defined the social units. Facets of an old megalithic culture, manifested in stone paved platforms in mens' houses where cut heads were buried and where ritual feasts and music-making were held, rice terracing, and buffalo sacrifice are evident, within a cosmology and a terrestial relationship with the dead, with the ancestors or the spirit of nature. In all these, a system of symbols is expressed in rituals, prayers, chanting, offerings, music making, singing, dancing, village revelry or a declaration of a village isolation to propitiate the death of a kin victim of the headhunt. After the arrival of the Spanish conquistadores and Catholic friars in the late sixteenth century and later American Protestant missionaries in early twentieth century, the gradual conversion to Christianity changed the ritual and musical landscape of highland northern Luzon, after and following the systematic prohibition and slow erosion of indigenous musical traditions in the lowlands. This paper outlines the various trajectories of resistance, conformity without acceptance, an eventual forgetting of the past, and the ritual transformation of the headhunting ritual complex in highland northern Luzon, utilizing a variety of sources -- colonial documents, contemporary ethnography and musical field data, and videos and pictures from the internet and social media.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2250978, "first_name": "Arsenio", "last_name": "Nicolas", "domain_name": "mahasarakham", "page_name": "ArsenioNicolas", "display_name": "Arsenio Nicolas", "profile_url": "https://mahasarakham.academia.edu/ArsenioNicolas?f_ri=698930", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2250978/717663/891269/s65_sen.nicolas.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 671, "name": "Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music?f_ri=698930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1987, "name": "Ethnomusicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnomusicology?f_ri=698930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4058, "name": "Ritual", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ritual?f_ri=698930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22559, "name": "Philippine Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Studies?f_ri=698930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22560, "name": "Philippine Cordillera", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Cordillera?f_ri=698930"}, {"id": 26064, "name": "Philippine History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_History?f_ri=698930"}, {"id": 100313, "name": "Philippine Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Music?f_ri=698930"}, {"id": 409489, "name": "Headhunting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Headhunting?f_ri=698930"}, {"id": 698930, "name": "Gongs and Bamboo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gongs_and_Bamboo?f_ri=698930"}]}, {"id": 1939973, "title": "1988 Gongan and Non-Gongan Structures : A Typology of Bamboo Musical Ensembles in Southwest Central Java.", "created_at": "2012-09-16T02:44:43.735-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1939973/1988_Gongan_and_Non_Gongan_Structures_A_Typology_of_Bamboo_Musical_Ensembles_in_Southwest_Central_Java?f_ri=698930", "dom_id": "work_1939973", "summary": "\"Several bamboo musical ensembles in Java imitate the gongan structures of the bronze gamelan.
