The argu- ment is that the Malay kerajaan of Patani was similar to\u2014rather than distinct from\u2014other port city-states on the peninsula and islands of Southeast Asia where a Sanskrit cosmopolis existed for a millennium before the earliest chapters of Islam\u2019s Southeast Asian expansion. Islam also circulated east and west of Patani through trade between the Middle East and China via the Indian Ocean. This created a range of Indian/Arab/Malay creole communities whose members played key roles in the adoption of, or adhesion to, Islam in Southeast Asian port city-states like Patani. India\u2019s importance to the arrival of Islam to the Thai/Malay peninsula relates to what Islam came to, where Islam initially came from, and who Islam came through. Rather than refer to conversion, I refer to an adhesion to, or adoption of, Islam. The impact of Thai and Islamic influences in Patani/Pattani following its defeat in 1785 is described. The details of the process through which the Malay Kingdom (SM. kerajaan) of   became the Thai Province of Pattani, including Bangkok\u2019s legislative and administrative initiatives are also provided. A central con- cern of this chapter is to highlight the fact that these developments coincided with a period of revolution and reform in the Hijaz. I describe how these developments impacted local religious life and thought through local luminaries such as Shaykh Daud Al-Fatani, Shaykh Ahmad Al-Fatani and Haji Sulong. The methodologies and contributions of present-day reformist revivalist movements are also described.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33674643, "asset_id": 7014095, "asset_type": "Work",

"Ethnic conflicts have increased in number since the end of the cold war. In the case of Moldova the ethnic conflict resulted in the formation of the secessionist political community of Transnistria. This dissertation attempts to assess the influence of heritage and language policies on the formation of new identities and ethnic mobilisation through an in-depth analysis of the case study of Transnistria. It argues that language and heritage affect ethnic classifications and can be the driving factors for the establishment and retainment of independent ethnic identities. The dissertation furthermore argues that those intrinsic variables can lead to inter-group rivalry and ethnic conflict, especially following de-nationalisation and language policies that threat en ethnic groups social identity and self-concept. Based on the results of the analysis, the study presents explanations of the influence of the historical formation of Moldova and de-nationalisation policies on the causation of the identity struggle that occurred after the adoption of the 1989 language laws and led to ethnic conflict in 1992. The results show that the conflict is caused by three major factors: threats to nationalist, linguistic and ethnic identity, nationalist sentiments, and the fear of pan-romanisation. It appears that the reshaping of borders and subsequent mass movements and de-nationalisation attempts had a tremendous influence on the perception of group belonging and Moldovan self-concept as they threatened Moldovan linguistic and national identity. The dissertation will conclude, with the evidence provided, that in the case of Moldova, heritage and de-nationalisation policies have created an environment of inter-group rivalry, that exacerbated with the adoption of the 1989 language laws.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31311665, "asset_id": 3619078, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2825677, "first_name": "Gregor", "last_name": "Engelmann", "domain_name": "nottingham", "page_name": "GregorEngelmann", "display_name": "Gregor Engelmann", "profile_url": "https://nottingham.academia.edu/GregorEngelmann?f_ri=990808", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2825677/924300/1691103/s65_gregor.engelmann.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=990808", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=990808", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11358, "name": "Secession", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Secession?f_ri=990808", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21376, "name": "Acculturation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Acculturation?f_ri=990808", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 37597, "name": "Moldova", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Moldova?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 37598, "name": "Transnistria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnistria?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 40705, "name": "Romanization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Romanization?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 72564, "name": "Perestroika", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Perestroika?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 288613, "name": "Glasnost", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Glasnost?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 437498, "name": "Sovietization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sovietization?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 838512, "name": "De-Nationalisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/De-Nationalisation?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 838513, "name": "Panromania", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Panromania?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 861826, "name": "Russification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russification?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 951694, "name": "Soviet Moldavia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soviet_Moldavia?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 990806, "name": "Soviet Nationalities Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soviet_Nationalities_Policy?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 990807, "name": "Soviet Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soviet_Language_Policy?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 990808, "name": "Ethnic Assimilation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Assimilation?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 990809, "name": "Soviet Economic Policy and Ethnic Groups", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soviet_Economic_Policy_and_Ethnic_Groups?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 990810, "name": "Romanian Majority In Moldavian SSR", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Romanian_Majority_In_Moldavian_SSR?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 993137, "name": "IR In Post soviet Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/IR_In_Post_soviet_Space?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 993151, "name": "Methodology of IR Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Methodology_of_IR_Studies?f_ri=990808"}]}, {"id": 7014101, "title": "Religious, Ethnic and Linguistic Diversity [Extract of Chapter 3 from Muslim Merit-making in Thailand's Far-south]", "created_at": "2014-05-11T13:00:52.080-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7014101/Religious_Ethnic_and_Linguistic_Diversity_Extract_of_Chapter_3_from_Muslim_Merit_making_in_Thailands_Far_south_?f_ri=990808", "dom_id": "work_7014101", "summary": "This chapter describes how ethnic identifications, language and religion in present-day Cabetigo have been affected by the Thai and Islamic influences described in previous chapters.

After a period of increasing tensions and deterioration in government-minority and minority-majority relations in Western Thrace (1974-1990) -- and when there were signs that the conflict was going to turn violent -- the situation began to de-intensify gradually but substantially. The period of deterioration was then followed by a period of improvement (1990-2003/4) in the situation of the Minority, and in its relations with the Government and the Majority.\n\nThis dissertation examines the dynamics that led to the deterioration in the first period, the reasons behind the shift from deterioration to improvement, and the dynamics that made the improvement long-lasting, uninterrupted and significant. To understand these dynamics and the changes, I have used a modified version of the Political Systems Analysis model, developed by David Easton. The data was collected from primary and secondary sources on the conflict from these two periods, and from interviews with individuals from the Minority, the Majority, and the Greek government.\n\nThis research shows that the Political System Analysis model can be very useful in explaining why and how the Government changed its policies, and how the situation in Thrace first deteriorated and then improved. The most important conclusion of the dissertation is that it was the change of the inputs from the actors and the addition of new actors that contributed to the Greek Government's pro-Minority shift in its policies. Another conclusion of this research is that in a democratic political system where the government is responsive to inputs from actors in its political environment, the freedom to peaceful protest is respected, the inputs from transnational and international actors (such as the European organizations) are important, ethnic conflicts, though a major problem, can be dealt with peacefully and constructively.\n\nThe dissertation ends with recommendations for further research and with suggestions as to what each of the key actors in the W. Thrace conflict should do to improve the situation in the region even further.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 6262412, "asset_id": 1023790, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 853715, "first_name": "Dimostenis", "last_name": "Yagcioglu", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DimostenisYagcioglu", "display_name": "Dimostenis Yagcioglu", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DimostenisYagcioglu?f_ri=990808", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/853715/303692/1062016/s65_dimostenis.yagcioglu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=990808", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=990808", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9547, "name": "Minority Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_Studies?f_ri=990808", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10495, "name": "Nationalism And State Building", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism_And_State_Building?f_ri=990808", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16211, "name": "Ethnic Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Conflict?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 28147, "name": "Nations and nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nations_and_nationalism?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 50279, "name": "Ethnic and Racial Assimilation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_and_Racial_Assimilation?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 51315, "name": "Accommodation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Accommodation?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 52381, "name": "Nationalism & Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism_and_Conflict?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 99915, "name": "Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Integration?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 161014, "name": "Social Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Integration?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 332935, "name": "National minorities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_minorities?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 958174, "name": "Cultural Associations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Associations?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 990808, "name": "Ethnic Assimilation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Assimilation?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 1006275, "name": "Ethnoculutral", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnoculutral?f_ri=990808"}, {"id": 1006278, "name": "Conflict.
