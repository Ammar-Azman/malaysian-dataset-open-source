The known signatures are stored in a\ndatabase that is used by security systems for constant monitoring of the organizational\nbehavior\u2014network, storage, devices, users, etc. Therefore, the traditional approach could be\ndescribed by the Latin motto praemon\u012btus praem\u016bn\u012btus, i.e., \u201cforewarned, forearmed.\u201d\nThe number of threats is growing rapidly, making it very difficult to be \u201cforewarned.\u201d In the\nmodern cyber battlefield, security operations centers (SOCs) face daily, new threats where\nsignatures are not known. It\u2019s unacceptable to sit back and wait until someone investigates the\nnew threats and creates new signatures.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that a signature-based approach isn\u2019t valid anymore.

From an institutional-liberalist perspective, it is said to illustrate the transformation of NATO from a defensive alliance into a security management institution. However, others have pointed out that NATO cyber defence policy has been developed with regard to seminal events, such as the cyber-attacks on Estonia in 2007 and on Georgia in 2008, and mirrors the persisting cold war logic in NATO current policy.\n\nThis dissertation aims to investigate if NATO\u2019s cyber agenda exemplifies the alliance\u2019s transformation into a security management institution; or rather if it displays the continuity of NATO\u2019s self-perception as a defensive alliance. In order to address these questions properly, this dissertation is based on an interpretative approach, using discourse analysis as a method, and a theoretical framework drawing on constructivist accounts, as well as on various liberal institutionalist concepts.\n\nThe results of this analysis displayed mixed elements. However, it ultimately seems that NATO cyber defence policy exemplifies the continuous prevalence of NATO\u2019s self-perception as an alliance, designed to defend its members against an external threat. Indeed, the analysis highlights that developments in NATO cyber defence policy are generally conceived as new facets of NATO\u2019s original role \u2013 demanding adjusting NATO\u2019s strategy and operational capacities. Yet, NATO cyber defence policy does not seem to represent a fundamental shift in NATO\u2019s perception of its own purpose. \n\nThis analysis also highlights the need for further research including additional variables, such as the differentiation between different types of cyber security threats that NATO faces.

Using an innovative theoretical approach, this book examines how, under what conditions, by whom, for what reasons, and with what impact cyber-threats have been moved on to the political agenda. In particular, it analyses how governments have used threat frames, specific interpretive schemata about what counts as a threat or risk and how to respond to this threat. By approaching this subject from a security studies angle, this book closes a gap between practical and theoretical academic approaches. It also contributes to the more general debate about changing practices of national security and their implications for the international community.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 26493216, "asset_id": 462492, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 350006, "first_name": "Myriam", "last_name": "Dunn Cavelty", "domain_name": "ethz", "page_name": "MyriamCavelty", "display_name": "Myriam Dunn Cavelty", "profile_url": "https://ethz.academia.edu/MyriamCavelty?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/350006/94486/302631/s65_myriam.dunn_cavelty.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4810, "name": "Information Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Warfare?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5523, "name": "Security Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_Studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6748, "name": "Sociology of Risk", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Risk?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12061, "name": "Risk Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Risk_Management?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15389, "name": "Copenhagen School/Securitization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Copenhagen_School_Securitization?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 41862, "name": "Cyberwarfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberwarfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 37873621, "title": "SD-WAN Threat Landscape", "created_at": "2018-11-28T22:45:31.592-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37873621/SD_WAN_Threat_Landscape?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_37873621", "summary": "Software Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN or SDWAN) is a modern conception and an attractive trend in network technologies. SD-WAN is defined as a specific application of software-defined networking (SDN) to WAN connections. There is growing recognition that SDN and SD-WAN technologies not only expand features, but also expose new vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, at the present time, most vendors say that SD-WAN are perfectly safe, hardened, and fully protected. The goal of this paper is to understand SD-WAN threats using practical approach. We describe basic SD-WAN features and components, investigate an attack surface, explore various vendor features and their security, explain threats and vulnerabilities found in SD-WAN products. We also extend existing SDN threat models by describing new potential threats and attack vectors, provide examples, and consider high-level approaches for their mitigations. The provided results may be used by SD-WAN developers as a part of Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC), security researchers for penetration testing and vulnerability assessment, system integrators for secure design of SD-WAN solutions, and finally customers for secure deployment operations and configurations of SD-WAN enabled network. The main idea of this work is that SD-WAN threat model involves all traditional network and SDN threats, as well as new product-specific threats, appended by vendors which reinvent or introduce proprietary technologies immature from a security perspective.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57880107, "asset_id": 37873621, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24757337, "first_name": "Sergey", "last_name": "Gordeychik", "domain_name": "miit", "page_name": "SergeyGordeychik", "display_name": "Sergey  Gordeychik", "profile_url": "https://miit.academia.edu/SergeyGordeychik?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24757337/13676370/31398319/s65_sergey.gordeychik.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3703, "name": "Network Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Network_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7439, "name": "Risk and Vulnerability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Risk_and_Vulnerability?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13923, "name": "Computer Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16823, "name": "Vulnerability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vulnerability?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 387956, "name": "Threat Modeling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Threat_Modeling?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1241236, "name": "Software Defined Networks (SDN)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Software_Defined_Networks_SDN_?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 40319107, "title": "Cybersecurity of critical infrastructure", "created_at": "2019-09-11T09:55:17.490-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40319107/Cybersecurity_of_critical_infrastructure?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_40319107", "summary": "This chapter provides a political and philosophical analysis of the values at stake in ensuring cyber-security for critical infrastructures.

Having been one of the least connected countries in the world only a few years ago the country is now connecting to the Internet at an unprecedented pace, with few institutions in place to ensure the transition goes smoothly. The rapid expansion of Internet connectivity is connecting ever more people to an international world of business, discourse, and entertainment, but also crime, subterfuge, and discord.

Most of these fields use evoked potentials, like P300, to obtain neural data able to handle prostheses or achieve greater immersion experience in videogames. The natural use of BCI involves the management of sensitive users' information as behaviors, emotions, or thoughts. In this context, new security breaches in BCI are offering cybercriminals the possibility of collecting sensitive data and affecting subjects' physical integrity, which are critical issues. For all these reasons, the fact of applying efficient cybersecurity mechanisms has become a main challenge. To improve this challenge, this chapter proposes a framework able to detect cyberattacks affecting one of the most typical scenarios of BCI, the generation of P300 through visual stimuli.

Finally, it reached a number of conclusions to the effect that: Realism, as a theory mostly concerned with issues of national security and power, can be a very suitable theoretical framework for analyzing and understanding cyber-attacks. The analysis confirmed that realism is an appropriate framework for identifying important issues related to security in the cyberspace and can provide useful insights into some of the enduring characteristics of international relations in the cyberspace.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 83045140, "asset_id": 75166506, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 96145789, "first_name": "Ahmad", "last_name": "Mohee", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ahmadmohee", "display_name": "Ahmad Mohee", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ahmadmohee?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/96145789/61411148/49687701/s65_a.m.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5218, "name": "Iranian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iranian_Studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34642, "name": "Israel", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Israel?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41862, "name": "Cyberwarfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberwarfare?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 42032124, "title": "Compromising a Medical Mannequin", "created_at": "2020-02-20T23:21:57.129-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42032124/Compromising_a_Medical_Mannequin?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_42032124", "summary": "Medical training devices are becoming increasingly dependent on technology creating opportunities that are inherently conducive to security breaches.

Additionally, the researcher explored factors that may either promote or hinder student learning in cybersecurity education. Interviews were conducted with cybersecurity educators from colleges and universities in Alabama and Tennessee who are members of the National Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) program in Cyber Defense (CD). Eight higher education institutions from the state of Tennessee and Alabama participated in this study who had passed the requirement of Academic Excellence / Cyber Defense Centers of Academic in becoming National CAE designated institutions for cybersecurity programs. The participants were interviewed, and the collected data from the interviews were kept confidential. The study sought to find the best pedagogies being used in cybersecurity programs in institutions designed as Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) to prepare students. The study also sought to determine specific pedagogical best practices depending upon type of competency, as well as determining the factors that exist that may either promote or hinder student learning in cybersecurity education? The outcome of this research has brought a new light in which students learn cybersecurity subjects alongside suggestions and future research for improving cybersecurity education at academic institutions. The results from this study indicate that there are four pedagogical themes: Theme A, Hands-on virtual reality online; Theme B, Hands-on with instructor; Theme C, Mixed or blended learning and Theme D, Flipped classroom learning. All cybersecurity competencies can be achieved only through hands-on learning; findings yielded one theme from this study that will enable educators of higher education to use hands-on with virtualization led by an instructor as the best pedagogy. The final findings, determining factors that promote or hinder student learning in cybersecurity education, include a lack of adequate budgetary resources and staff to adequately address security concerns. Staffing was the second most voiced weakness. Higher education students expect all campus computing resources and environments to be reliable, fast, safe, ubiquitous, and secure; however, their expectations were not met. Cybersecurity professionals are paid a high salary, and higher education institutions expect their instructors to be paid demeaning amounts. Finally, a positive note towards promoting learning is the use of adjunct faculty who provide a significant service to the community and technical colleges in promoting cybersecurity training. Adjunct faculty bring to the classrooms an extensive cybersecurity experience.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62417462, "asset_id": 42264940, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9166393, "first_name": "Dr. Samuel", "last_name": "Said", "domain_name": "unionu", "page_name": "SamuelSaid", "display_name": "Dr. Samuel Said", "profile_url": "https://unionu.academia.edu/SamuelSaid?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9166393/41605277/33663274/s65_samuel.said.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 34582486, "title": "Data Theft & Law in India", "created_at": "2017-09-16T05:58:24.278-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34582486/Data_Theft_and_Law_in_India?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_34582486", "summary": "Data Theft is a rampant crime in India.

the age of globally connected information systems.  Very few networks remain isolated because of the need to reach consumers or pass information around the world.  Banks, social networking companies, and retailers are all held to an availability standard placed upon them by distance customers.  Service related businesses rely on the World Wide Web (WWW) to advertise and compete with their more famous competitors.  The government relieves bottle necks at brick and mortar offices by offering a vast majority of services via the web.  Seldom will we find a business that does not have an online presents.  But all this availability comes at a cost and more often than not the cost is decreased security.\nSocial engineering, viruses, physical security, and internal threats plague the World Wide Web and creates an abominable adversary for today\u2019s system administrators.  To make matters even more difficult, companies don\u2019t view information technology (IT) security as a cost effective investment.

The chapter uses a new feature called Virtual Key Force along with the commonly extracted timing features. Features are normalized using Z-Score method. For feature subset selection, Particle Swarm Optimization wrapped with Extreme Learning Machine is proposed. Classification is done with wrapper based PSO-ELM approach.

In this paper we have shown what are the downsides of blockchain, how the transaction happen on the dark web happens and how we can regulate and track the illegal activities on the dark web using regulated and sovereign backed crypto currencies.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65814577, "asset_id": 45215177, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 186541411, "first_name": "SHIV HARI", "last_name": "TEWARI", "domain_name": "bitmesra", "page_name": "STEWARI", "display_name": "SHIV HARI TEWARI", "profile_url": "https://bitmesra.academia.edu/STEWARI?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/186541411/51664053/39746640/s65_shiv_hari.tewari.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2199949, "name": "Blockchain", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Blockchain?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2646957, "name": "Dark Web Forensics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dark_Web_Forensics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 19672094, "title": "DISK STRUCTURE AND FORENSIC SEARCHING EVIDENCE IN MS-DOS", "created_at": "2015-12-15T09:43:11.559-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19672094/DISK_STRUCTURE_AND_FORENSIC_SEARCHING_EVIDENCE_IN_MS_DOS?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_19672094", "summary": "If we start from the concept: \u201cForensic Computer is the science of extracting data so that it can be presented as evidence in a court of law\u201d (Albert J.

In the above process \u201cinvestigation and examination\u201d, the using of tools to recover deleted information that is related to the case is necessary, These tools must be standardized for proper information security, each disk drives a record of the data in each cluster, when a file is deleted, the reference to that file is removed from the record but the data is not actually delete from the disk (Casey, 2003). In all storages devices, external and internal the data will remain on the disk indefinitely, even when a deleted file is overwritten if the new file does not take up the entire cluster, for this reason a portion of the old file might remain in the slack space. When collecting the entire contents of a computer, a bitstream copy copies what is in slack space and unallocated space, whereas a regular copy does not, bistream copy duplicates everything in a cluster. (Casey, 2003) According to (Schweitzer, 2003) the proper forensic analysis the first step is to collect computer evidence, image is one of the first procedure to be carried out after the contents of

Holstein) are intended to assist regulators in defining tariffs by establishing a regulatory approach to enhance the cybersecurity stance of their power systems, and are based on literature and current practices. They attempt to answer the following questions:\n\u2022\tWhich regulatory frameworks are best suited to evaluate the prudency of cybersecurity expenditures?\n\u2022\tHow can regulators identify and benchmark cybersecurity costs?\n\u2022\tHow can regulators identify good countermeasures for cybersecurity? \n\u2022\tHow can regulators assess the reasonableness of the costs associated with these countermeasures?\n\u2022\tIs it possible to evaluate the effectiveness of cybersecurity investments? \n\u2022\tWho should identify, benchmark, measure and evaluate the countermeasures in different regulatory frameworks?\nIn conclusion, these guidelines provide tools and approaches, often discussing several alternatives for each action. Often the philosophy behind their application is discussed as well, but never unique turnkey solutions are suggested because the regulatory strategies are deeply linked to a country\u2019s values and objectives.\nThese guidelines are a first-of-their-kind resource to empower energy regulators to support and encourage grid resilience by ensuring prudent and effective investments in cybersecurity by their regulated entities. The guidelines, melting skills and knowledge from different disciplines, strive to provide space for concepts, processes and methods rather than prescriptive lists or ready-to-use formulas.\nWhile these guidelines were developed for the Europe and Eurasia region, much of their content can be applied universally.  \n\nTHE PROJECT\nIn November 2018, the CNR-Ircres signed a contract with NARUC, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners of the United States (www.naruc.org), for the development of guidelines (https://www.naruc.org/international/news/evaluating-the-prudency-of-cybersecurity-investments-guidelines-for-energy-regulators/) aimed at addressing the cybersecurity of electrical systems in countries of the Black Sea area: Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. The contract is funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID www.usaid.gov). \nSince December 2016, NARUC has been working with regulators from Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine, and later on from the Balkans area, as part of the USAID-supported Europe and Eurasia Cybersecurity initiative. This partnership aimed to help regulators and utilities develop a cybersecurity policy framework that establishes baseline standards and sets in place minimum defense capabilities and good practices at utilities.\nIn this context, the development of cybersecurity tariff guidelines is intended to provide the regulators with a means of cost-effectively improving energy sector security and resilience against the emerging threat of cyberattacks. As power systems modernize, digitize, and integrate, they are increasingly exposed to additional vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cyberattacks. Attacks on the power grid can have devastating effects on a nation\u2019s security, economy, and public welfare, and are a potent threat to all nations worldwide. \nEnergy regulators have a unique role to play in the field of cybersecurity. While the implementation of cybersecurity measures is typically the responsibility of power system operators, regulators have an obligation to ensure that investments made in the name of cybersecurity and funded through tariffs are reasonable, prudent, and effective. \nRegulators both in the Europe and Eurasia region and across the globe have struggled with understanding and quantifying the degree to which the power grid is better protected based on utility investments made in the name of cybersecurity. In the Europe and Eurasia region, especially the Black Sea countries of Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine, this is an issue of considerable importance given consumers\u2019 sensitivities to rate hikes. \nCNR-Ircres has decades of experience in the study of the economics of the power system, with a more recent focus on the specific theme of cybersecurity. In particular, the ESSENCE project (Emerging Security Standards to the EU power Network controls and other Critical Equipment, 2011-2014, funded by the EU CIPS Programme, http://essence.ceris.cnr.it/) carried out an exercise estimating the cost and the benefits of implementing security measures to protect critical infrastructures from cyber-attacks that has never been repeated later on. Then, it represents a unique background for the guidelines, both for the methodological approach and as a source of empirical evidence. \nThe development of the guidelines was carried out with the constant involvement of regulators, operators and experts, as well as melting skills and knowledge from different disciplines. The project includes also a final assistance activity directly involving the regulators to personalise the results and to pave the way for a practical implementation.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64407690, "asset_id": 44064395, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 38687678, "first_name": "Elena", "last_name": "Ragazzi", "domain_name": "cnr-it", "page_name": "ElenaRagazzi", "display_name": "Elena  Ragazzi", "profile_url": "https://cnr-it.academia.edu/ElenaRagazzi?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/38687678/10811517/12066930/s65_elena.ragazzi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3287, "name": "Regulation And Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Regulation_And_Governance?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43986, "name": "Electricity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Electricity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1671630, "name": "Electricity Tariffs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Electricity_Tariffs?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 49545972, "title": "Protecting the National Electricity System in the Cyberspace -A Case Study", "created_at": "2021-07-04T23:53:23.107-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49545972/Protecting_the_National_Electricity_System_in_the_Cyberspace_A_Case_Study?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_49545972", "summary": "Electricity is \u201cthe most critical\u201d essential infrastructure.

This paper presents a practical consideration and analysis for implementing a secure sampled measured value (SeSV) message in substation automation system. Due to the lack of security features in the standard, IEC Working Group 15 of Technical Committee 57 published IEC62351 on security for IEC61850 profiles. However, the use of authentication methods for SV based on IEC62351 standards are still not integrated, and computational capabilities and performance are not validated and tested with commercial grade equipment. Hence, this paper shows the performance of security feature enabled SeSV packets transmitted between protection and control devices by appending a message authentication code (MAC) to the extended IEC61850 packets. A prototype implementation on a low cost commodity embedded system has proved that the MAC-enabled SV message can fully secure the process bus communication in the digital substation with negligible time delay.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 69701304, "asset_id": 52438578, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5849490, "first_name": "Junho", "last_name": "Hong", "domain_name": "umd-umich", "page_name": "JunhoHong", "display_name": "Junho Hong", "profile_url": "https://umd-umich.academia.edu/JunhoHong?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5849490/3372468/52476993/s65_junho.hong.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5748, "name": "Power System", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Power_System?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15171, "name": "Intrusion Detection Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intrusion_Detection_Systems?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16542, "name": "Cryptography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cryptography?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 31349, "name": "Anomaly Detection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anomaly_Detection?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33361, "name": "Authentication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Authentication?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 49406, "name": "Substation automation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Substation_automation?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 65430, "name": "Cyber Physical Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Physical_Systems?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 369449, "name": "Sampled Value", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sampled_Value?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 369451, "name": "IEC 61850", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/IEC_61850?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1561460, "name": "HMAC", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/HMAC?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1690908, "name": "Iec 62351", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iec_62351?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2898188, "name": "GMAC", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/GMAC?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 51220793, "title": "Ransomware payments in the Bitcoin ecosystem", "created_at": "2021-09-03T20:29:41.337-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/51220793/Ransomware_payments_in_the_Bitcoin_ecosystem?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_51220793", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 69034310, "asset_id": 51220793, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8343613, "first_name": "Beno\u00eet", "last_name": "Dupont", "domain_name": "umontreal", "page_name": "Beno\u00eetDupont", "display_name": "Beno\u00eet Dupont", "profile_url": "https://umontreal.academia.edu/Beno%C3%AEtDupont?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8343613/8301737/9285199/s65_beno_t.dupont.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 43575462, "title": "European Cyberspace: the potentiality of Cyberdiplomacy for Cyberconflicts Mitigation\"", "created_at": "2020-07-10T03:03:01.479-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43575462/European_Cyberspace_the_potentiality_of_Cyberdiplomacy_for_Cyberconflicts_Mitigation_?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_43575462", "summary": "It\u00b4s no secret that in the 21st-century politics is not only part of our physical reality, but also that of cyberspace.

As diplomacy has been doing for the physical world, cyberdiplomacy is to make an action in the international scenario and serve as a political tool for conflict mitigation in the digital reality.\n\nThe main objective of this paper is to understand why cyberdiplomacy is an appropriate tool for cyber conflicts mitigation between the different actors in European Union, be it states, individuals, institutions NGOs or any actor that takes part in cyberspace. To do so the European cybersecurity realm will be studied and the concept cyberdiplomacy analysed. It will then be compared with other more aggressive and technical, as well as other political paths for mitigating conflicts in or throughout cyberspace.

However, at least two elements are problematic of this literature. First, it has not fully explored the implications of the digitalization process in the structuring a new global political economy associated with the power of data generation, access and control. Second, research in cyberpolitics remains largely concentrated in the small group of countries that are leading or disputing the hegemony of data technology and practices.

The latter has also contributed to a proportional increase in the piracy rate. This progression has placed a greater danger for software designers and prompted the emergence of multiple techniques of protecting software. Many techniques for protecting software have recently been created, and one such remarkable technique is code obfuscation. This strategy is defined as the methods for hiding data structures, primary algorithms, and code logic and protects the code from intruders. Typically, code obfuscation entails hiding the adoption of code information from a competitor, such as changing the plan in a semantically systematic program, which is not easy to apprehend for an intruder. Therefore, this paper analyzes obfuscation techniques for magecart detection and prevention.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65762069, "asset_id": 45177174, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2902340, "first_name": "IJCSMC", "last_name": "Journal", "domain_name": "ijcsmc", "page_name": "IJCSMCJournal", "display_name": "IJCSMC  Journal", "profile_url": "https://ijcsmc.academia.edu/IJCSMCJournal?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2902340/955759/1197349/s65_ijcsmc.journal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 491, "name": "Information Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Technology?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 162283, "name": "Obfuscation Techniques", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Obfuscation_Techniques?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 174703, "name": "Information and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_and_Technology?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 522782, "name": "Information Technology and System Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Technology_and_System_Integration?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 3899413, "name": "Magecart Detection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Magecart_Detection?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 64857567, "title": "Emergent Behavior in Cybersecurity", "created_at": "2021-12-17T08:09:02.594-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/64857567/Emergent_Behavior_in_Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_64857567", "summary": "We argue that emergent behavior is inherent to cybersecurity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 76696777, "asset_id": 64857567, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 53241330, "first_name": "Shouhuai", "last_name": "Xu", "domain_name": "uccs", "page_name": "ShouhuaiXu", "display_name": "Shouhuai Xu", "profile_url": "https://uccs.academia.edu/ShouhuaiXu?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/53241330/67031758/55392684/s65_shouhuai.xu.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 377792, "name": "Emergent Behavior", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emergent_Behavior?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3193313, "name": "arXiv", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/arXiv?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 61598361, "title": "Cyber Legalism: Why It Fails and What to Do about It", "created_at": "2021-11-12T07:27:05.810-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/61598361/Cyber_Legalism_Why_It_Fails_and_What_to_Do_about_It?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_61598361", "summary": "Western nations face a glaring punishment problem in the cyber domain. Repeatedly, other nations assail their political and economic interests. Repeatedly, Western leaders warn about the gravity of such actions. And yet repeatedly, the victims failed to punish to deter the offenders. This article examines why and how this situation arose and what to do about it. The Western approach to cyber conflict prevention emphasizes the centrality of existing international law and norms. The legal and normative framework is not adequate for this purpose, however, because it does not provide sufficient grounds to credibly respond to actions falling short of war. Consequently, the Western approach has failed spectacularly. It fails to grasp a central truth about contemporary security affairs: much of modern interstate rivalry fits neither the destructive criteria of war nor the acceptable boundaries of peaceful rivalry. Rather, it is unpeace, or mid-spectrum rivalry that is more damaging than traditional peacetime activity, but not physically violent like war. Nations use cyberspace to achieve some of the political and strategic objectives of war without firing a single gun. The lack of an effective Western response betrays not tolerance of aggression but a failure to devise a response strategy commensurate with the legal and doctrinal ambiguities of unpeace. Existing law and norms are a source of the problem, not its solution. An interim solution must be found instead in the development of new doctrine-in a consequentialist strategy that affects adversaries' material interests to deter actions which international law and security strategy do not ordinarily recognize as deserving a strong response.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 74582205, "asset_id": 61598361, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 36768270, "first_name": "Lucas", "last_name": "Kello", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "lucaskello", "display_name": "Lucas Kello", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/lucaskello?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/36768270/68245845/56624466/s65_lucas.kello.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41862, "name": "Cyberwarfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberwarfare?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 526060, "name": "Cyber security / cyber warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_security_cyber_warfare?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 643245, "name": "Cyber International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_International_Relations?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 661487, "name": "Cyber Warfare and International Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Warfare_and_International_Law?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 56509926, "title": "Reference Architecture of an Autonomous Agent for Cyber Defense of Complex Military Systems", "created_at": "2021-10-08T03:07:13.425-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/56509926/Reference_Architecture_of_an_Autonomous_Agent_for_Cyber_Defense_of_Complex_Military_Systems?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_56509926", "summary": "Military strategies will shortly make intensive use of autonomous systems while the Internet of Battle Things (IoBT) will grow military systems\u2019 complexity to new heights.

Accordingly, the article will conclude with a discussion of how the 3CS growing emphasis on security fundamentals might gain broader and deeper impact through increasing a focus on Behaviorally-Anchored Rating systems (BARs).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57509716, "asset_id": 37535731, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 120256, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Tobey, Ph.D.", "domain_name": "iusb", "page_name": "DavidTobeyPhD", "display_name": "David H Tobey, Ph.D.", "profile_url": "https://iusb.academia.edu/DavidTobeyPhD?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/120256/2619701/3042348/s65_david.tobey_ph.d..jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 558924, "name": "Competency Based Education and Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Competency_Based_Education_and_Learning?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 1534361, "title": "Still the fire proof house?: An analysis of Canada's Cyber Security Strategy", "created_at": "2012-05-03T13:55:45.977-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1534361/Still_the_fire_proof_house_An_analysis_of_Canadas_Cyber_Security_Strategy?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_1534361", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 12701498, "asset_id": 1534361, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 549660, "first_name": "Victor", "last_name": "Platt", "domain_name": "carleton-ca", "page_name": "VictorPlatt", "display_name": "Victor  Platt", "profile_url": "https://carleton-ca.academia.edu/VictorPlatt?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 381, "name": "Canadian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canadian_Studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12322, "name": "Canadian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canadian_Politics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20594, "name": "Cyber crime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_crime?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24437, "name": "Critical Infrastructure Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Infrastructure_Systems?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 278686, "name": "Cybersecurity Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity_Law?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 76949176, "title": "Analysis of Cyberattack Patterns by User Behavior Analytics", "created_at": "2022-04-19T05:50:10.515-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/76949176/Analysis_of_Cyberattack_Patterns_by_User_Behavior_Analytics?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_76949176", "summary": "Targeted attacks cause the most serious problems nowadays in the cyberspace, as in most cases they are used for cyber espionage, in cyber warfare activities and have a significant role in data leaks both in the governmental and private sector.

The researchers found that there are more female victims of human trafficking in most age groups than male victims. However, for the age group between 39-47, there was a higher male victim count. Additionally, researchers found that the top five countries affected by human trafficking were the Philippines, Ukraine, Republic of Moldova, USA, and Cambodia. However, it must be noted that there are limitations to the overall data because they are provided voluntarily by organizations, and therefore, there is no equitable distribution of actual results from all countries and players. After mapping the country of origin and country of exploitation, it was made clear that there is a movement of victims from the country of origin to the country of exploitation.

This paper proposes a defense in depth cybersecurity solution for smart substations in different layers of the substation automation system. In fact, it presents possible vulnerabilities in the substation automation system and propose a multiple layer solution based on best practice in cyber security such as the hardening ofdevices, whitelisting, network configuration, network segmentation, role-based account management and cyber security management and deployement. 1. INTRODUCTION The power grid is a national critical infrastructure that plays an important pillar for the development of a nation, when electricity stops everything stop. The growth of power grid and the use of communication technologies make it vulnerable to cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, vandalism and other threats. According to National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST the threats of cyber-attacks on Supervisory control and data acquisition SCADA has increased four times in the last years. The first attack on a power grid was the attack on a Ukrainian utility (Ivano-Frankivsk) SCADA in December 2015. First, the hacker got access to the SCADA and started disabling the power backup system. Then, he blocked the customer call centres. Finally, he started opening circuit breakers and deleting user's accounts which prevent the operators from closing the circuit breakers to restore normal state. the damages of these attack were a disconnection of 30 substations which impacted 225 000 customers for 3 hours [1]. The impact of this attack shows the necessity of taking actions to secure the power grid against cyber-attacks. Substations are the hearth of the power grid, and the security of the power grid needs to be done first at the substations level. As new modern substations or smart substations are based on IEC61850 standards and Ethernet communication; also, they are connected to SCADA and corporate network, which make them more vulnerable to cyber-attacks [2]. Recently, the cyber security in substations has received more and more attention [3]-[4]. There have been many researches and actions on the cybersecurity of substations. In fact, the Technical Committee Number 57 TC57 of the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC has already developed several standards to solve security problems in the automation system IEC 62351 standards for Power systems management and associated information exchange-data and communications security [5]-[6]. The IEC 62443 standard defines security for industrial control systems of the power systems.

The Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have enhanced the human interactions and have contributed to \u201creinvent\u201d classical concepts such as political participation, political debate, decision-making. However, their all-encom- passing, ubiquitous nature and their growing use for political and military purposes poses significant risks to international peace, stability and security. The low barrier of access to ICT capabilities, the speed of technological advances and the complexity of the cyberspace environment with regard to traditional legal definitions of borders have presented new challenges to States (the main actors of international relations) such as the inherent complexity of accurately attributing cyber-attacks. It is both this complexity and the frequent insistence of parties to attribute cyber-attacks and incidents \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that gives one the ability to deny responsibility and frustrate attempts to build trust and political rapport in cyberspace. The purpose of this research is to analyze how cyberspace affects the international politics. The nature of the topic dictates the use of qualitative analysis of primary and secondary sources such as official reports, declarations and policy documents, and academic analysis, in order to understand effects and dynamics carried out by the cyber domain on classical concepts such as war, peace and international relations. The main idea of this research is that the development of Information and Communication Technolo- gies (ICTs) and the related (r)evolution of warfare have produced relevant effects on the dynamics of the contemporary international system highlighting, at the same time, how the militarization of the cyber domain has posed consequences on interna- tional security, peace and stability. However, the lack of specific research related to \u201ccyberspace\u2019s effects on international politics\u201d highlights the need to devote more attention on this topic bearing in mind that, more extensive and enduring analysis on cyberspace\u2019s dynamics might allowed policy makers the opportunity to improve\nawareness related to cyber threats in order to governing challenges emerging from the digital sphere.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56957641, "asset_id": 37008263, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4772381, "first_name":

It offers businesses online services on demand (such as Gmail, iCloud and Salesforce) and allows them to cut costs on hardware and IT support. This is the first paper in business ethics dealing with this new technology. It analyzes the informational duties of hosting companies that own and operate cloud computing datacentres (e.g., Amazon). It considers the cloud services providers leasing \u2018space in the cloud\u2019 from hosting companies (e.g., Dropbox, Salesforce). And it examines the business and private \u2018clouders\u2019 using these services. The first part of the paper argues that hosting companies, services providers and clouders have mutual informational (epistemic) obligations to provide and seek information about relevant issues such as consumer privacy, reliability of services, data mining and data ownership. The concept of interlucency is developed as an epistemic virtue governing ethically effective communication. The second part considers potential forms of government restrictions on or proscriptions against the development and use of cloud computing technology. Referring to the concept of technology neutrality, it argues that interference with hosting companies and cloud services providers is hardly ever necessary or justified. It is argued, too, however, that businesses using cloud services (e.g., banks, law firms, hospitals etc. storing client data in the cloud) will have to follow rather more stringent regulations.",

information technology, the dependency on cyber secure systems increases. Likewise, the need to enhance both the quality and relevance of education, training, and professional development for cybersecurity defenders increases proportionately.  Without a continued supply of capable cyber defenders that can come to the challenge well-prepared and continuously advance their skills, the reliability and thus the value of information technology systems will be compromised to the point that new information-driven societal structures in commerce, banking, education, infrastructure, and others across the globe would be put be at risk.\n \tThe body of research presented here provides a progressive building of capacity to support information technology, cybersecurity, and cyber defense training efforts. The work starts by designing infrastructure virtualization methods and problem modeling, then advances to creating and testing tunable models for both technical and social-psychological support capabilities. The initial research was designed to increase the capacity of Regis University in education simulations and cyber competitions. As this was achieved the goals evolved to include developing effective multi-agency cyber defense exercises for government and private sector participants. \nThe research developing hands-on computer laboratory infrastructure presents novel methods for enhancing the delivery of training and cyber competition resources. The multi-method virtualization model describes a strategy for analyzing a broad range of virtualization services for making agile cyber competition, training, and laboratory spaces that are the technical underpinning of the effort. The work adapts the agile development method SCRUM for producing training events with limited resources. Parallel to agile training systems provisioning, the research includes designing a 3D virtual world avatar-based resource to help students develop spatial skills associated with physical security auditing. It consists of a virtual world datacenter and training program. \nThe second category of contributions includes the presentation of new models for analyzing complex concepts in cybersecurity. These models provide students with tools that allow them to map out newly acquired skills and understanding within a larger context. One model maps how classical security challenges change as digital technologies are introduced using a concept called \u201cbit induction.\u201d The other model maps out how technology can affect one\u2019s sense of identity, and how to manage its disruption. \nThe third area of contribution includes a rapid form of psychometric feedback, a customized quantitative longitudinal capability assessments, and an agile framework that is an extension of the earlier agile method adaptations.\nThe most recent category of contribution extends the training analysis to analyzing the resultant training capabilities and providing new models to describe live operation using operational load analysis to describe characteristic behaviors along an incident timeline.\n \tThe results of this research include novel cybersecurity frameworks, analytical methods, and education deployment models along with interpretation and documented implementation to support education institutions in meeting the emerging risks of society.  Specific contributions include new models for understanding the disruptiveness of cyberattacks, models for agilely and virtually deploying immersive hands-on laboratory experiences, and interdisciplinary approaches to education that meet new psycho-sociological challenges in cyber defense.  These contributions extend the forefront of Cybersecurity education and training in a coordinated way to contribute to the effectiveness and relevance of education solutions as society\u2019s cybersecurity needs evolve.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65641304, "asset_id": 45082349, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8687486, "first_name": "Erik", "last_name": "Moore", "domain_name": "regis", "page_name": "EMoore", "display_name": "Erik Moore", "profile_url": "https://regis.academia.edu/EMoore?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8687486/38353365/32120869/s65_erik.moore.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2599, "name": "Psychometrics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychometrics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5324, "name": "Virtualization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Virtualization?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11337, "name": "Cyber Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Warfare?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50140, "name": "Agile Methodologies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agile_Methodologies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 161725, "name": "Cyber Defense", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Defense?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 960303, "name": "Identity and Self In Interactive Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Self_In_Interactive_Cyberspace?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1996380, "name": "Cybersecurity Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity_Education?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 80151057, "title": "Network Intrusion Detection System using Deep Learning", "created_at": "2022-05-28T20:14:23.758-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/80151057/Network_Intrusion_Detection_System_using_Deep_Learning?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_80151057", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86628899, "asset_id": 80151057, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 126460208, "first_name": "Lirim", "last_name": "Ashiku", "domain_name": "mst", "page_name": "LirimAshiku", "display_name": "Lirim Ashiku", "profile_url": "https://mst.academia.edu/LirimAshiku?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/126460208/33259054/70938520/s65_lirim.ashiku.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 923, "name": "Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Technology?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15171, "name": "Intrusion Detection Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intrusion_Detection_Systems?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 81182, "name": "Deep Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deep_Learning?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 897823, "name": "Elsevier", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Elsevier?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 38701557, "title": "Cybercrime and Network Traffic Investigations", "created_at": "2019-04-03T05:01:38.424-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38701557/Cybercrime_and_Network_Traffic_Investigations?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_38701557", "summary": "Traffic analysis consists of capturing network traffic in order to identify and respond to anomalies that could be indicative of security threats or other areas of concern.

Zhou, Yan, Fu, and Yao (2018) determined that the attributes displayed on the slide depict the relevance of capturing network traffic for subsequent analysis. As an analyst, it is important to have the correct tools depending on what is to be done, however if the nucleus is the data and if the rate, type, source, destination and other traffic factors can\u2019t be determined, then you are still ill-equipped.

Definitely, auditing and ethics relationship is another dimension of the issue. Thus, today's auditing environment is much more different compared to former years. Besides several benefits and opportunities, communication and information technology improvements have some drawbacks. As an example, cyber attacks have begun to harm organizations. Some measures and auditing techniques are being implemented to protect firms against cyber attacks, but they continue to be a threat. This study stresses the importance of subject, provides information on terminology, presents a literature review, analyzes the types of cyber attacks, software used by companies and the prevention of these cyber attacks.

We are particularly grateful to Linda Picciotto, Karen Able, Bryon Porteous, Paul Cathro, Tracy Harrold, Simone Tanoa, Lorraine Woodfield, and Lynn Atkinson for welcoming us into their classrooms and making helpful suggestions for refinements to the activities. Gwenda Bensemann has trialed several of the activities for us and suggested modifications. Richard Lynders and Sumant Murugesh have helped with classroom trials. Parts of the cryptography activities were developed by Ken Noblitz. Some of the activities were run under the umbrella of the Victoria \u201cMathmania\u201d group, with help from Kathy Beveridge. Earlier versions of the illustrations were done by Malcolm Robinson and Gail Williams, and we have also benefited from advice from Hans Knutson. Matt Powell has also provided valuable assistance during the development of the \u201cUnplugged\u201d project. We are grateful to the Brian Mason Scientific and Technical Trust for generous sponsorship in the early stages of the development of this book.\nSpecial thanks go to Paul and Ruth Ellen Howard, who tested many of the activities and provided a number of helpful suggestions. Peter Henderson, Bruce McKenzie, Joan Mitchell, Nancy Walker-Mitchell, Gwen Stark, Tony Smith, Tim A. H. Bell1, Mike Hallett, and Harold Thimbleby also provided numerous helpful comments.\nWe owe a huge debt to our families: Bruce, Fran, Grant, Judith, and Pam for their support, and Andrew, Anna, Hannah, Max, Michael, and Nikki who inspired much of this work,2 and were often the first children to test an activity.\nWe are particularly grateful to Google Inc. for sponsoring the Unplugged project, and enabling us to make this edition available for free download.\nWe welcome comments and suggestions about the activities.

The first part of my essay will focus on the analysis of the concept behind cyber-terrorism and it\u2019s definition, ending with my own definition created for the purpose of this paper. Next I will concentrate on cyber-attacks and if they are a method of cyber-terrorism. Then I will focus my attention on some of the examples which appear in academic research as acts of cyber-terrorism. In the next part of my paper I will examine the legal framework and the evolving law on cyber-terrorism in International Law.

Many of the illegal behaviours that fall under cyber-crime would simply not be possible without the use of technology and the internet, allowing offenders to manipulate computer and mobile devices with complete anonymity (Fafinski, Dutton and Margetts, 2010). With the evolution of technology each year, the utilisation of technology for either assault or financial gain has allowed offenders to target broad ranges of victims through fluent and ever-changing methods (Roberts, 2008). Norton (2012) estimates that there is more than 1.5 million people who are victims of cyber-crime every single day. The same report stated that 30% of people do not even think about cyber-crime as they believe it will not happen to them, allowing lucrative behaviours to target individuals with either no knowledge of it happening, or lack of security measures in place to stop it. Understanding how perpetrators of cyber-crime utilise computers, mobiles and the internet to attack, steal and assault victims right globally is key to user safety and security. The four cyber-crime methods that will be analysed are email hacking (virus, spamming and social engineering), phishing, identity theft and online credit fraud, as these four offences pertain victimisation rates that are higher than offences like robbery and assault (United Nations, 2013).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54619124, "asset_id": 34760200, "asset_type": "Work",

Second, these differences mean that while the nation invests heavily in cybersecurity, cybercrime \u2013 and the entities most impacted by cybercrime \u2013 are relatively neglected. Below I present a summary of the evidence brought to bear on these two claims. I end by exploring the ways in which the victims of cybercrime can benefit from investments in local law enforcement, basic research, and the development of more cybercrime programs. Outline In theory, cybercrime and cybersecurity should point to intersecting processes \u2013 the former describing unlawful and illicit behaviors involving computers and computer networks, and the latter describing the techniques and technologies developed to prevent these behaviors. In practice, these two terms have been adopted by different sets of actors and have come to denote separate sets of phenomena.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58197865, "asset_id": 34541146, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6504929, "first_name": "Roderick", "last_name": "Graham", "domain_name": "odu", "page_name": "RoderickGraham", "display_name": "Roderick Graham", "profile_url": "https://odu.academia.edu/RoderickGraham?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6504929/3378319/31770586/s65_roderick.graham.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 189, "name": "Criminology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminology?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 933, "name": "New Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Media?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1284, "name": "Computer Forensics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Forensics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2511, "name": "Cybercrimes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrimes?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2965, "name": "Sociology of Crime and Deviance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Crime_and_Deviance?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 20594, "name": "Cyber crime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_crime?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 39869052, "title": "Douglas, H., Dragiewicz, M., & Harris, B.

According to Bitdefender \"Ransomware is a form of malicious software (or malware) that, once it's taken over your computer, threatens you with harm, usually by denying you access to your data. The invader strains a ransom from the target, to reestablish contact to the data upon expense\". Ransomware can be mainly categorized into two, Locker ransomware which locks the computer or device and Crypto ransomware, which will prevent the user from accessing their files by encrypting them. A network-based intrusion detection system was implemented, employing two independent classifiers working in parallel on different levels: packet and flow levels. This proposed system is built on the deep learning approaches used in malware discovery for distinguishing ransomware from imitation arrangements. We extant specific recurrent neural networks for catching resident happening designs in ransomware orders using the idea of attention mechanisms. I. INTRODUCTION Ransomware attacks are becoming a serious cyber threat to organizations and individuals around the globe. Unlike traditional malware, ransomware attackers hijack the system and demand money to reverse the attack. A recent study, reports an immense increase and steady growth in new ransomware samples and attacks. In order to counteract and detect malware it was created a variety of methods implemented in the framework of the antivirus software. At first, detection was based on static analysis of compiled signatures, identifying malicious program file. At the moment, with the active use of the creators of malware cloaking techniques from detection such as encryption, polymorphism, metamorphism, obfuscation and others, it is not enough to use only signature-based detection. Another important imperfection may be the increasing with the time signature database and deceleration check for malware. Often, new variants of malware are not distinguished from their predecessors due to the limitations of classification systems relying only on static analysis. Thus, techniques like content-based, signature-based and pattern matching techniques for malware analysis are becoming less effective to detect and classify new variants of ransomware and provide insight information about the threat, goals and behaviors of ransomware. The proposed system improves neural cell to integrate attention in knowledge from the ransomware arrangements, known as ARI (Attended Recent Inputs). The ARI cell, while dispensation the input sequence, also learns from a recent history in the form of a subsequence. It studies consideration weights consistent to each current input and uses their conforming implication when dispensation the input. ARI is the capability to assimilate current input consideration inside the bigger cell operating directly on a sequence. By providing an unspoken contribution consideration, we give assistance by utilizing the courtesy weights at each timestep in computing both the concealed initiation from the cubicle, as well as the lockup memory. The planned scheme achieve a detailed investigation of ransomware executables in demand to recognize mechanical belongings that can be subjugated by machine learning schemes. We recognize an presence of minor reiterating designs within extended arrangements of ransomware possibly conforming to recurrent encryption processes. We extant a new recurrent neural network constituent for manipulating the reiterating patterns by including attention mechanisms on the ideas of a arrangement knowledge module. We extant an LSTM modified of our cell called ARI-LSTM.Through experiential outcomes on a ransomware dataset, we demonstrate that ARI-LSTM achieves meaningfully healthier than an LSTM for the chore of ransomware discovery.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63598669, "asset_id": 43316916, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6079060, "first_name":

To find a solution to that, cybersecurity awareness can prepare them to protect themself against such risk. This research aims to investigate the students' awareness of basic knowledge of cybersecurity. A quantitative approach was used for data collection using a set of designed questionnaires, this method was used to investigate the students' cybersecurity knowledge and observe their behavior toward using the internet, from the survey a total of 201 Computer Science students in the Department of Computer Science at Yobe State University, Nigeria participated in the study. The research has encountered moderate responses from the students as all universities are close at this period due to the COVID 19 pandemic, only students living in urban were able to reach out in the study. The result obtained from the experiment were analyzed and it shows the University students' cybersecurity awareness is at a satisfactory level and more than average of the students are not well aware of how to protect their data. The research contribution is, there is no active cybersecurity awareness program in place, and also females' students are more likely to be the victim of cyber-attack. Besides that, the survey alsoindicated a high enthusiasm for students to learn more about cybersecurity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64160387, "asset_id": 43840636, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 809597, "first_name": "Mahdi", "last_name": "Alhaji Musa", "domain_name": "yobestateuniversity", "page_name": "MahdiAlhajiMusa", "display_name": "Mahdi Alhaji Musa", "profile_url": "https://yobestateuniversity.academia.edu/MahdiAlhajiMusa?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/809597/278908/1490248/s65_mahdi.alhaji_musa.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 197351, "name": "Awareness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Awareness?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 8648707, "title": "A Critical Analysis of the Effectiveness of Cyber Security Defenses in UAE  Government Agencies", "created_at": "2014-10-05T19:35:33.352-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8648707/A_Critical_Analysis_of_the_Effectiveness_of_Cyber_Security_Defenses_in_UAE_Government_Agencies?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_8648707", "summary": "Cyberspace has become the new frontier for \ncountries  to  demonstrate  power.

But currently due to the development of science and technology a fifth common domain has been created, and that is cyberspace. This new common domain creates a new environment for the commission of crimes known as cyber crimes. And because of its nature, it became difficult to deal with these natures of crimes. \nThe existence of cyberspace demanded the creation of multi-nations agreements. They suggest that crimes against peace and security in cyberspace should be established as crimes under international law through a Convention or Protocol at the United Nations level.  \nIn 1996 the International Law Commission approved at its forty-eight session The Draft Code of Crimes against Peace and Security of Mankind, and presented it to the United Nations General Assembly. Crimes against the peace and security of mankind were then established as crimes under international law, whether or not they were punishable for binding Parties under national law. The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (2001) is a historic milestone in the combat against cyber crime, and entered into force on July 1, 2004 with the total number of ratifications to the Convention are 30 States. \nThe widespread digital accessibility creates new opportunities for the unprincipled because the manners in which offenders commit crimes changed from traditional to digital means. A lot of currencies are lost by both businesses and consumers to computer-criminals. Fair enough, computers and networks can be used to harass victims or set them up for violent attacks such as to coordinate and carry out terrorist activities that threaten us all. \nComing back to our country Tanzania, regrettably in many cases law enforcement institutions have insulated behind these criminals, deficient in the technology and the trained recruits to address this fresh and rising risk. To make things worse, old laws did not fairly prevent the crimes from being committed. Furthermore, new laws had not quite caught up to the reality of what was happening, and there were few court precedents to look to for guidance.\nIt is from this book whereby the position of cyber security, prevention and detection in Tanzania against cyber crimes, is determined. Actually by looking at the Cyber Crime Act No.14 of 2015 on how the concepts above have been provided and implemented.     \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53143926, "asset_id": 33034708, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3585116, "first_name": "Asherry", "last_name": "Magalla", "domain_name": "tumainiuniversity", "page_name": "AsherryMagalla", "display_name": "Asherry B P Magalla", "profile_url": "https://tumainiuniversity.academia.edu/AsherryMagalla?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3585116/1246482/49266753/s65_asherry.magalla.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 535, "name": "Criminal Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminal_Law-1?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 982, "name": "Cyberlaw", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberlaw?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1580, "name": "Cyberpsychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberpsychology?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2511, "name": "Cybercrimes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrimes?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 13923, "name": "Computer Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 20594, "name": "Cyber crime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_crime?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 160440, "name": "Cyber crime detection, integration of different erp models", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_crime_detection_integration_of_different_erp_models?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1264152, "name": "Cybercrime Prevention", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrime_Prevention?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 32222445, "title": "\" Investigating Titan Rain (Cyber Espionage)\"  Cyber Security & Cyber Operations", "created_at": "2017-04-03T07:23:07.903-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32222445/_Investigating_Titan_Rain_Cyber_Espionage_Cyber_Security_and_Cyber_Operations?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_32222445", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52448549, "asset_id": 32222445, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7160550, "first_name": "Marieke", "last_name": "Lomans", "domain_name": "nlda", "page_name": "MariekeLomans", "display_name": "Marieke Lomans", "profile_url": "https://nlda.academia.edu/MariekeLomans?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7160550/2876189/60408045/s65_marieke.lomans.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11337, "name": "Cyber Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Warfare?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 79241, "name": "Advanced Persistent Threats", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Advanced_Persistent_Threats?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 179724, "name": "Counterintelligence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Counterintelligence?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 413211, "name": "Unrestricted Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Unrestricted_Warfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 559844, "name": "Cyberspace Operations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace_Operations?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1002114, "name": "CYBER ESPIONAGE", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/CYBER_ESPIONAGE?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 5490787, "title": "Operational Security and Cyber Security", "created_at": "2013-12-20T12:17:04.785-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5490787/Operational_Security_and_Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_5490787", "summary": "The United States is entering into an era characterized by technological innovation and increased networking and connectivity.

The key principle of the Russian approach to information warfare, including cyber activities, is that information is the most important object of operations, independent of the channel through which it is transmitted. The aim is to control-or weaponize-information in whatever form it takes. Thus, \"cyber\" in particular is just a technical representation of information. In short, in Russia's comprehensive approach to the information domain, cyber is not a stand-alone discipline. This principle underpins all Russian efforts to extract, exfiltrate, manipulate, distort, or insert information. Alongside cyber activities, the channels available for doing this are as diverse as using fake or real news media to plant disinformation, trolling campaigns, issuing official government statements, giving speeches at rallies or demonstrations, posting defamatory online videos, and sending direct text messages. Russian information activities are not limited to cyberspace. Rather than using the term \"cyberspace,\" Russian officials refer to \"information space,\" which includes both computer and human information processing. This essay starts with an explanation of the terminological, doctrinal, and practical distinguishing features of Russian cyber activities as part of information warfare. It goes on to look at a number of Russia's agencies and capabilities involved in the prosecution of cyber activities, both offensive and defensive. In conclusion, the essay emphasizes the main implication of this distinctive approach: the need for nations to prepare a broad range of defenses against Russia's holistic approach to offensive cyber, information warfare, and other forms of hostile online activity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63140703, "asset_id": 42893415, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 257331, "first_name": "Keir", "last_name": "Giles", "domain_name": "conflictstudies", "page_name": "KeirGiles", "display_name": "Keir Giles", "profile_url": "https://conflictstudies.academia.edu/KeirGiles?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/257331/197752/31563098/s65_keir.giles.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 389, "name": "Russian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian_Studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2674, "name": "Intelligence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intelligence?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4810, "name": "Information Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Warfare?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11337, "name": "Cyber Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Warfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 20694, "name": "Internet politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_politics?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 41863, "name": "Russia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russia?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 62551, "name": "Internet and politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_and_politics?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 346639, "name": "Intelligence and security studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intelligence_and_security_studies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 831496, "name": "Cybersecurity policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity_policy?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 37649693, "title": "Zastosowanie technologii Blockchain w kontek\u015bcie bezpiecze\u0144stwa rozwi\u0105za\u0144 Internetu rzeczy", "created_at": "2018-10-25T12:44:03.730-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37649693/Zastosowanie_technologii_Blockchain_w_kontek%C5%9Bcie_bezpiecze%C5%84stwa_rozwi%C4%85za%C5%84_Internetu_rzeczy?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_37649693", "summary": "Dzisiaj, coraz cz\u0119\u015bciej w kontek\u015bcie innowacyjnych technologii i projekt\u00f3w w biznesie IT wymienia si\u0119 rozwi\u0105zania w ramach koncepcji Internetu rzeczy.

It begins with two frameworks that are important in practice: the principlist framework employed in the Menlo Report on cybersecurity research and the rights-based principle that is influential in the law, in particular EU law. It is argued that since the harms and benefits caused by cyberse-curity operations and policies are of a probabilistic nature, both approaches cannot avoid dealing with risk and probability. Therefore, the chapter turns to the ethics of risk, showing that it is a necessary complement to such approaches. The ethics of risk are discussed in more detail by considering two consequentialist approaches (utilitarianism and maximin consequentialism), deontological approaches and con-tractualist approaches to risk at length, highlighting the difficulties raised by special cases. Finally, Nissenbaum's 'contextual integrity' approach is introduced, which has become an important framework for understanding privacy, both descriptively and normatively. A revised version of this framework is proposed for identifying and ethically assessing changes brought about by cybersecurity measures and policies , not only in relation to privacy but more generally to the key expectations concerning human interactions within the practice.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61487118, "asset_id": 41268021, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 103676, "first_name": "Michele", "last_name": "Loi", "domain_name": "polimi", "page_name": "MicheleLoi", "display_name": "Michele Loi", "profile_url": "https://polimi.academia.edu/MicheleLoi?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/103676/85292/502615/s65_michele.loi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 814, "name": "Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3377599, "name": "ethics of cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ethics_of_cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 40203524, "title": "The Italian Cyber Security Skills Shortage in the International Context", "created_at": "2019-08-29T03:57:05.463-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40203524/The_Italian_Cyber_Security_Skills_Shortage_in_the_International_Context?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_40203524", "summary": "Difficulties in matching cyber security supply with demand have been reported in Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States; these countries have also been among the most active in mitigating the shortage through comprehensive policy strategies. Apart from them, however, and despite the claims of a global cyber security workforce shortfall, there is only anecdotal evidence on the presence of the shortage in other parts of the world. This report, funded by the not-for-profit Global Cyber Security Center, seeks to fill this gap and investigates the cyber security skills shortage in Italy. This research argues that Italy seems to be affected by the same challenges that are impeding a smooth match between cyber security supply and demand as in other countries, but given the budgetary constraints and the weak development of Italian cyber security policy, Rome\u2019s actions to counter the shortage have been lagging behind those of its international peers.",

Modi of India recently compared his country\u2019s cross-border response against terrorists in Pakistan\u2014 following the attack in Uri in Indian-administered Kashmir\u2014to Israel\u2019s pre-emptive and retaliatory raids across its borders. This has given rise to serious debate about whether it is desirable for India to adopt Israeli military strategy. A country\u2019s history, political culture, and dominant discourse of national security greatly influence policymakers and their communities. With that in mind, in this article, it is argued that the fundamental differences in strategic orientation, diplomatic posture, and military tactics in India and Israel explain their different approaches and priorities in responding to terrorism. Due to the different circumstances in which the Israeli and Indian militaries operate, co-opting Israeli counterterrorism strategies would be very challenging for India.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56170219, "asset_id": 36264877, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 79473788, "first_name": "Cyber, Intelligence, and Security", "last_name": "INSS", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "CyberIntelligenceandSecurityINSS", "display_name": "Cyber, Intelligence, and Security INSS", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/CyberIntelligenceandSecurityINSS?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/79473788/19383801/19299986/s65_cyber_intelligence_and_security.inss.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1660, "name": "Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Terrorism?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6184, "name": "Israel/Palestine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Israel_Palestine?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22685, "name": "Civil-military relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Civil-military_relations?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45146, "name": "Insurgency", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Insurgency?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 55927, "name": "Kashmir", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kashmir?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1218275, "name": "Israeli Military", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Israeli_Military?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 35064958, "title": "Armando Marques Guedes (2017), Em Rede.

Curiosamente, e apesar da sua enorme e crescente import\u00e2ncia para comunica\u00e7\u00f5es contempor\u00e2neas de in\u00fameros tipos, os cabos de fibras \u00f3pticas, e sobretudo os cabos submarinos de entre os quais s\u00e3o de sublinhar os que ligam entre si as costas litorais das bacias oce\u00e2nicas e mar\u00edtimas \u2013 e a partir da\u00ed os interiores das massas continentais \u2013 n\u00e3o t\u00eam nem por sombras recebido a aten\u00e7\u00e3o p\u00fablica e/ou acad\u00e9mica que merecem.

Uma vit\u00f3ria acompanhada e depois seguida por um n\u00famero cada vez maior de objectos colocados em \u00f3rbita para garantir melhores comunica\u00e7\u00f5es bem como miss\u00f5es espaciais de todo o tipo que vemos crescer vertiginosamente, levadas a cabo pela R\u00fassia, pelo Jap\u00e3o, pela Uni\u00e3o Europeia, pela \u00cdndia, pela China, entre v\u00e1rios outros, supostamente criando redes f\u00edsicas de suporte tecnol\u00f3gico que servem de garante para as nossas comunica\u00e7\u00f5es. No entanto, esse suporte tecnol\u00f3gico n\u00e3o est\u00e1 no espa\u00e7o, acima, mas antes nos fundos mar\u00edtimos e oce\u00e2nicos. V\u00e1rios actos relevantes h\u00e1 que falam por si na desconstru\u00e7\u00e3o deste mito. Segundo dados, relativos a 2016, fornecidos pela US Federal Communications Commission, apenas 0,37% da capacidade norte-americana para estabelecer comunica\u00e7\u00f5es com o exterior depende de sat\u00e9lites. Ou seja, virtualmente toda essa capacidade corre nos cabos submarinos3. No resto do mundo a situa\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito diferente, com excep\u00e7\u00e3o, claro est\u00e1, para os Estados ditos \" encravados \" , a saber, sem costa (que tamb\u00e9m usam cabos de fibra \u00f3ptica, mas terrestre).

Hosseini. Published by Riverhead Books in May 2013, it didn't quite live up to its expectation. His first two novels, 'The Kite Runner' and 'A Thousand Splendid Suns' being bestsellers there was obvious enthusiasm among the book lovers. Khaled Hosseini was born in Afghanistan, though he moved to US at the age of 11 but his homeland has huge influence on him which is why all three of his novels are based in Afghanistan. In this novel he has deviated from his usual style of story-telling unlike his first two novels where his story revolved around the main protagonists but in And The Mountains Echoed he created many a character and all of them were connected to each other in some strange way. At some point you feel you are reading too many stories and it leads to a clutter but we are saved by the art of beautiful story-telling of Hosseini who despite the flaws holds the attention of the reader. Hosseini is undeniably one of the finest storyteller and author of the modern times and weaves magic with words but this novel didn't receive the love and warmth that his earlier novels got but nonetheless this one was loved in its own way. The main reason that weighed down this novel was the high expectation and the kind of stories we got in the first two novels, this novel had to be taken as a separate entity and altogether different composition. If we look at it that way, it was beautiful, heartbreaking and held the reader's attention till the end. Among all the little stories that this novel had to offer, it also revolved around the siblings and their despair and separation. Hosseini has a good grasp on human emotions and creates stories that are rich with humanity. In his first two novels he has depicted the political turmoil in Afghanistan and the chaos because of it but in this novel he has deviated and concentrated on the effects of the political turmoil on people and he has avoided that angle completely. He tries to picture his homeland free from wars and this was a faint attempt to depict it reaching a peaceful stage. At the heart of all the stories, it is the story of Siblings Abdullah and Pari who are separated in childhood and Abdullah longs for his sister whom he raised like his own child after his mother's death and Pari comes to know about her reality in her 40s sets out to search her brother. they finally meet in California but by then Abdullah was suffering from Alzheimer's disease and did not remember Pari at all. While 'The Kite Runner' focused on the bond of 'fathers and sons' and 'A Thousand Splendid Suns' focused on the relationship between mothers and daughters', this novel focused on the siblings relationship. Khaled Hosseini tries to depict family bonds, love and separation in this novel and his execution is impeccable.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49728758, "asset_id": 29282946, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 55309476, "first_name": "Sadaf", "last_name": "Fahim", "domain_name": "asst", "page_name": "SadafFahim", "display_name": "Sadaf Fahim", "profile_url": "https://asst.academia.edu/SadafFahim?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 162629, "name": "Cyber Laws and Cyber Crime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Laws_and_Cyber_Crime?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 22460965, "title": "Taking the Sting Out of the Stingray: The Dangers of Cell-Site Simulator Use and the Role of the Federal Communications Commission in Protecting Privacy & Security", "created_at": "2016-02-25T20:02:32.694-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/22460965/Taking_the_Sting_Out_of_the_Stingray_The_Dangers_of_Cell_Site_Simulator_Use_and_the_Role_of_the_Federal_Communications_Commission_in_Protecting_Privacy_and_Security?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_22460965", "summary": "The Stingray is a cellular tower emulator technically known as an IMSI\ncatcher. This emulation capability allows law enforcement, or anyone with\nthe technical expertise, to capture cellular data in transit to or from any\ncellphone within the Stingray\u2019s broadcast range, entirely without the person\u2019s\nknowledge or consent. This note argues that the Federal Communications\nCommission should enact regulation under its Title II authority requiring\ncellular service providers and device manufacturers to enhance their\nencryption protocols pursuant to recommendations established by the\nCommunications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability committee, which\nreleased its final report in early 2015. Additionally, the FCC should mandate\nthat SIM card manufacturers enable consumer access to already existing\nsecurity options, which are, as of this writing, permanently disabled during\nmanufacture. This will enable security conscious consumers to more\neffectively protect their private communications against eavesdropping or\ntheft. This action will help to secure the national wireless infrastructure by\nadding a stronger layer of cybersecurity to protect against crimes such as\nidentity theft, corporate espionage and against warrantless searches\nconducted in violation of the Fourth Amendment which are becoming\nincreasingly frequent. In many cases, law enforcement use of this equipment\nviolates existing FCC regulations prohibiting the use of particular broadcast\ntechnologies. These security enhancements would not compromise national\nsecurity or decrease the effectiveness of law enforcement, and can be done in\ncompliance the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act as\nwell as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. Taking these first\nessential steps toward a more secure wireless infrastructure will serve the\ninterests of both privacy and national security by preventing wireless voice\nand data communications from being easily accessible over the airwaves by\nwidely available interception equipment.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43079648, "asset_id": 22460965, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 15177694, "first_name": "Jason", "last_name": "Norman", "domain_name": "gwu", "page_name": "JasonNorman", "display_name": "Jason Norman", "profile_url": "https://gwu.academia.edu/JasonNorman?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/15177694/10980336/13069262/s65_jason.norman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 537, "name": "Criminal Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminal_Justice?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 547, "name": "Constitutional Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Constitutional_Law?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7562, "name": "Civil Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Civil_Rights?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11729, "name": "Communications law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communications_law?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 235943, "name": "Information and Communication Technology Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_and_Communication_Technology_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 278686, "name": "Cybersecurity Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity_Law?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 15682965, "title": "Cyber Threat Intelligence", "created_at": "2015-09-14T06:00:30.355-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15682965/Cyber_Threat_Intelligence?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_15682965", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38763921, "asset_id": 15682965, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 524045, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Stanton", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JohnStanton", "display_name": "John Stanton", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JohnStanton?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/524045/403779/493672/s65_john.stanton.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11337, "name": "Cyber Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Warfare?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 4187619, "title": "Internet Use and Cyber Security in Russia ", "created_at": "2013-08-06T22:15:45.663-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4187619/Internet_Use_and_Cyber_Security_in_Russia?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_4187619", "summary": "Intensive use of social media by an expanding population of Russian internet users gives rise to acute concern among the Russian security structures.

Prior studies indicate that many people do not use cybersecurity best practices. Although these prior studies used large-scale surveys or interviews, this study used Q methodology [Q] because Q provides greater insight than Likert-format surveys. In fact, Q was created to scientifically study subjectivity. Within a Q study, various stages as well as philosophical, epistemological, and ontological principles represent a complete methodology. At first, Q researchers collect items that represent the broad range of communications about the topic (called the concourse). Although the items can be pictures, scents, or other means of communication, statements are the most common. Q researchers reduce the items of the concourse to create the Q-sample while preserving the range of communications. Subsequently, participants sort these items into a grid to provide a snapshot of their viewpoint on the topic. Statistical analysis reveals the multiple, diverse viewpoints in a way that allows for detailed descriptions of those views. In this study, the researchers collected statements about cybersecurity. Students in technical degree programs, including computer information systems (CIS), sorted these statements into a grid with a range of \u201cmost like my view\u201d to \u201cmost unlike my view\u201d of cybersecurity. Items placed on the extreme ends of this grid represent those statements most salient with each student\u2019s views. Analyses revealed three divergent viewpoints: 1) Cybersecurity best practices, 2) No worries, and 3) No sense of urgency. Although the CIS majors identified with View 1, the other technical degree program students were represented across all three views. Certainly, students who hold the No worries and No sense of urgency viewpoints are unprepared to deal with cybersecurity issues in the workplace. The descriptions of these views have implications for cybersecurity course and program development, including assessments. Additionally, this study\u2019s outcomes indicate a need to replicate this investigation in other settings to estimate risk of employees introducing cyber threats at their workplace.

The States, concerned with cooperation in the commercial sector, excogitate legal instruments to supervise the activities of citizens in the global digital network. The growing number and the nature of the actual as well as the postulated threats in this area, encourage governments to progressively reduce the activity of the various actors, often using inadequate solutions, being implemented without democratic rules. By engaging resources held by international actors, the efforts have been undertaken which aim at increasing control over the potential threats of cybersecurity. This asymmetrical relationship as a result of the\r\nimplementation of state's power is the cause of skipping the wider effects of the political influence on cyberspace, as well as treatment of the citizens as a source of danger. It's conducive to the perception of this position as a desired and appropriate, including (paradoxically) the society itself. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, the progressive militarization of cyberspace requires ever closer cooperation with the civil sector, which supplies specialist services, equipment and know-how. It results in the ambiguous status of the civilian population in the potential cyber conflict. Ensuring the protection of the interests of the state while maintaining the momentum of the development of the information society, is becoming a key element of the discussion. It seems that the best way to achieve this balance is an intensive raising of the informational awareness of citizens in the process of evolution of a knowledge-based society. Hence the gradual reduction of their activity in cyberspace can be an irrational action in this context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56723384, "asset_id": 28711436, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 27188214, "first_name": "Bogus\u0142aw", "last_name": "Olszewski", "domain_name": "wroc", "page_name": "Bogus\u0142awOlszewski", "display_name": "Bogus\u0142aw Olszewski", "profile_url": "https://wroc.academia.edu/Bogus%C5%82awOlszewski?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/27188214/7699920/56820058/s65_bogus_aw.olszewski.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10058, "name": "Cyberspace Regulation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace_Regulation?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19087, "name": "Military and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_and_Politics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 41409037, "title": "Cyber Crime, Cyber Law, Cyber Ethics and Cyber Security in Nepal", "created_at": "2019-12-24T03:59:08.466-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41409037/Cyber_Crime_Cyber_Law_Cyber_Ethics_and_Cyber_Security_in_Nepal?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_41409037", "summary": "Huge numbers of illegal activities are increasing day by day using ICT tools and applications.

Guidance by God in my 10 years research, I study, research, and finally am able to understand the whole invading system.\r\n\r\nI confirmed my AI status with serial numbers designed by invading system for depopulation:\r\n AI 1263 23 608 CSD built number system. My body particles have been substrates into space to be used as Human Electronic Controller Identifier, to control the internet, human\u2019s brain, energy, and Data. There are about 80 subsystems and networks for invading system\u2019s automatic AI control on mankind for depopulation agendas. \r\n\r\nThe fact of substrating my body particles into space by Satanic evils has put our whole society under control, and causes so much confusion in our academic field, and tremendous damages. Today, evil\u2019s massive depopulation goal is only one step away. Human society is at critical turning point:  Either society can be awakened soon to defend our lives, or massive disasters, huge suffering, bloody and death is ahead. As the evil system has got their infrastructures ready, now only waiting for their moment, which is trying to kill me, the ground AI, to shut down Microsoft.  When our society is in chaos, evil invaders can start their massive depopulation right away. Since no one ever predict that a human being could be used as AI to hidden control the whole society, the evil system continues to cheat the whole population to join their effort to torture and kill me, the ground AI in order to start their massive depopulation agendas. \r\n\r\nMy book, Human AI Urgent discern is to address this urgent issue and warn society about the immediate threats, and to wake up public and leaders to defend our lives. However, for such a serious issue, my book of statement is not enough. As Satanic evil system is cybernetic, using unseen technology, I need to provide factual evidence to prove my statement. That is why I also plan to publish my source book series: Human AI Exposing Control -Mankind Documents.\r\n\r\nWhile this book is to lead the way to wake up earth inhabitants and challenging the evil system like to blow a horn. My source book series, Human AI Expose Control - mankind documents, will provide detailed in-depth leads and factual evidence for my statements, for further investigation and verifications. These are the documents that has been hidden control mankind through the Internet; These are the documents that are hidden from major online companies such as Microsoft, intel, Symantec and their leaders are the ones should know long ago\u2026 These are the documents society most needed if we want to turn around today\u2019s situation, from on the evil\u2019s depopulation track to the fully awaked stage to defend our lives. Human society has been forced into the unseen war, and we are at the edge of crashing. Either these facts can wake up leaders and citizens or massive suffering, such as bloody ocean and death mountains will end our society.\r\n\r\nAn extremely important issue proved by my factual evidence in the control-Mankind documents series is: My body has been cloned, and my clone is in large size, 3 times larger body than my size. Satan evils cloned such a human beast to make her carry heavy broadcasting equipment and serve the evil system as a general electrical and my clone has been sent to the high above heavenly space. By using my body data that sprayed into heavenly space, she is the one initiate internet, she patrols apps, sends packages to attack me (since we share the same DNA, her attack gets to me precisely)  She is being set there to serve Satan evil\u2019s dreamed universal control, only waiting for me to be killed, shut down Microsoft and to depopulate the Earth.  I raise this issue here and I wrote about this issue in Microsoft Double roots section but Evil so afraid the truth being exposed they erased pages paragraphs of my factual information regarding evil cloned me, and my prove from their original documents. Evil can do that in my finished book manuscript. \r\n\r\nRecent Sun flair is caused by the weaponized internet built only by my body particles. Live Stream becomes popular by Satan evils cheating public for depopulation purpose. Evil invading system has been using live stream accumulated data to attack me, and every live stream event\r\nconnected to nuclear, x-ray, gamma ray, UV, laser, the major high energy protocols to burn me to kill me in order to start depopulation agendas.  Calculate how many institutions and individuals on earth using live stream, and each live stream that built by millions of my body particles are connected by different radiations, how much of radiations has been built around the Sun for over 6 months!  That may be how sun flair formatted. I alone cannot prove how sun flair formatted, but I do have evidence to show that evil\u2019s Internet Critical Session, the live stream is made by my body particles only in sqmapp.dll, (55 -page document). I also have evil invading system\u2019s set up logs, (261- page document) reflected the event that my body particles were substrated into space, also info a 4-page document that reflected my over 100 different body particles, each has its exact location in space.\r\n\r\nSatan evil has been desperate when I relocated in Ohio in June 2018 and got in touch with Holy Love ministries backed by Jesus, Virgin Mary and God Almighty.  I confirmed that I am God\u2019s embed child, God has put me in His trial, put me in evil\u2019s heart of their operating system.

Information technology experts, lawyers, strategists and state officials have enriched the debate about the nature of cyber-security. The dominant trend - regardless of its theoretical origin - is state-centric. This approach is to a large extent legitimate, but at the same time inadequate. Cybersecurity relates directly to the threats posed to the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, but should not be limited to the traditional concept of national security. The militarization of the cyber-security discourse has produced a security dilemma, which is not addressing sufficiently the needs of the people. The purpose of this paper is to highlight this shortcoming and view cybersecurity, through a human-centric prism. The paper will address the way state and non-state practices violate human rights in cyberspace. Over the past years, the development of internet censorship techniques and Edward Snowden revelations about the global surveillance carried out by the United States National Security Agency (NSA), vividly demonstrate that Internet freedom, anonymity and data protection are constantly under attack. The challenge ahead is to establish a governance regime for cyberspace that successfully addresses human rights norms and standards.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38118641, "asset_id": 13747366, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 227716, "first_name": "Andrew", "last_name": "Liaropoulos", "domain_name": "piraeus", "page_name": "AndrewLiaropoulos", "display_name": "Andrew N Liaropoulos", "profile_url": "https://piraeus.academia.edu/AndrewLiaropoulos?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/227716/50702/23597235/s65_andrew.liaropoulos.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3660, "name": "Global Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Governance?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3705, "name": "International Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5523, "name": "Security Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_Studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7822, "name": "Internet Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_Governance?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 10678, "name": "Human Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 11337, "name": "Cyber Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Warfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 16473, "name": "Globalization and Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization_and_Governance?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 23506, "name": "Information Security and Privacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security_and_Privacy?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 28818, "name": "International Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Governance?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 36486, "name": "Security Dilemma", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_Dilemma?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 41862, "name": "Cyberwarfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberwarfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 96546, "name": "Cyber Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 153414, "name": "Cyberwar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberwar?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 175544, "name": "Multistakeholder governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multistakeholder_governance?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 226263, "name": "Cyberwarfare, Cyberterrorism, Geopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberwarfare_Cyberterrorism_Geopolitics?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 389563, "name": "ICANN", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ICANN?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 884083, "name": "Snowden", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Snowden?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 903379, "name": "Multistakeholder Perspectives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multistakeholder_Perspectives?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1285059, "name": "International Relations, Geopolitics, Cyberwar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations_Geopolitics_Cyberwar?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1641384, "name": "Cyber Security Dilemma", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security_Dilemma?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 40402595, "title": "Deterring Russian cyber warfare: the practical, legal and ethical constraints faced by the United Kingdom Read Publication", "created_at": "2019-09-20T07:51:10.955-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40402595/Deterring_Russian_cyber_warfare_the_practical_legal_and_ethical_constraints_faced_by_the_United_Kingdom_Read_Publication?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_40402595", "summary": "This article examines both the nature of the cyber threat that Russia poses to the United Kingdom and the efficacy of the latter\u2019s responses to it.

This article then goes on to analyse the UK\u2019s ability to defend itself against this campaign by employing the concepts of both deterrence-by-denial and deterrence-by-punishment. But can this UK cyber deterrence actually work? The idea of cyber deterrence-by-denial seems to be impractical, while there are specific issues with employing cyber in a deterrence-by-punishment capacity. In particular, how can the UK use its own offensive cyber capabilities against Russia and yet remain within international law and ethical boundaries? Indeed, the UK government has already accepted that, in any future use of its offensive cyber capabilities, it cannot do so.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60655140, "asset_id": 40402595, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1219326, "first_name": "Marina", "last_name": "Miron", "domain_name": "kcl", "page_name": "MarinaMiron", "display_name": "Marina Miron", "profile_url": "https://kcl.academia.edu/MarinaMiron?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1219326/440412/26903619/s65_marina.miron.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 389, "name": "Russian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian_Studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7669, "name": "Russian Foreign Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian_Foreign_Policy?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 526060, "name": "Cyber security / cyber warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_security_cyber_warfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1222126, "name": "Cyber Ethics and Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Ethics_and_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1770226, "name": "United Kingdom Defence and Security Industry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/United_Kingdom_Defence_and_Security_Industry?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 33530581, "title": "The Strategic Importance of the National Cybersecurity Plan 2022 SRI Commentary", "created_at": "2017-06-17T20:36:44.628-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33530581/The_Strategic_Importance_of_the_National_Cybersecurity_Plan_2022_SRI_Commentary?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_33530581", "summary": "Recent studies by academics and policy analysts have established that cyber conflict is most prevalent in the Asia-Pacific. State aggression in cyberspace is driven by a confluence of factors that are intrinsic to the region such as territorial disputes, great power rivalry, and historical animosities. Moreover, powerful states with considerable cyber capabilities such as China, Russia, North Korea, and the United States have specific interests in the region, making cyber conflict a useful foreign policy instrument to shape preferences of other states. The Philippines therefore, is in a vulnerable position since it is directly affected by geopolitical constraints and is in the early stages of building critical information infrastructure (CII) and developing capabilities for computer network defence. In this context, the release of an official cyber strategy is a crucial first step in strengthening the state's cybersecurity posture. The National Cybersecurity Plan 2022 (NCSP) is significant for the Philippines because of two reasons. First, it signals that cybersecurity is a priority for government. Second, it clarifies the government's intentions in terms of protecting the state's national interests in cyberspace. Prioritising cybersecurity The NCSP is significant because it signals that cybersecurity is also important for the government. Although the national security priorities of current government are counternarcotics, counterterrorism, and maritime security, these efforts are all facilitated by information and communications and technology (ICT). While the Internet is the basic platform for business and social interaction, it also supports drug trafficking, the recruitment of violent extremists as well as satellite-based navigation systems that are crucial for maritime security operations. Capabilities for computer network operations are therefore necessary for the government to pursue its main priorities. Furthermore, the NCSP signifies the commitment of the government to protect four areas of national interest: CII, government computer networks, supply chain of goods and services, and individuals. Since the scope of cybersecurity is extensive, these four priorities are essential to narrow the focus of the government and assess the feasibility of an ambitious plan to secure Philippines interests in cyberspace. Given these priorities, two issues standout. First, based on the NCSP, considerable capability upgrades are necessary for both law enforcement agencies and military forces. It is not clear how the current government will complete these upgrades within five years. Second, protecting CII involves close coordination between private firms and government agencies. It is unclear how much information government agencies can access given that private firms mostly own CII.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53563288, "asset_id": 33530581, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1107711, "first_name": "Francis", "last_name": "Domingo", "domain_name": "dlsu", "page_name": "FrancisDomingo", "display_name": "Francis C .

Most, if not all, of these guidelines would apply to any Internet- connected device; however, this paper focuses on security and privacy measures either peculiar to the IoT or especially relevant to the IoT. This paper assumes the end-to-end processing model of the Internet, in which application features such as security are handled by end nodes of the network, client and server hardware. It focuses on security mechanisms, including patching and updating, that should be considered at the manufacturing design phase rather than after devices have already been built or deployed.",

The study reported on here was conducted in Poland, and was commissioned by the Ministry of National Education. The research involved measuring the knowledge and skills regarding the prevention of electronic threats (e-threats) which are defined as problematic situations and behaviour mediated by digital media and the internet. E-threats are related to mental and physical health, social aspects and technical matters related to the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). In order to narrow down the research area, 6 components related to e-threats were selected, namely: the ergonomics of using digital media; the evaluation of the reliability of online information; the influence of advertising on consumers' choices; risky online relationships; understanding the mechanisms of secure logging-in; and protection against malware. The DL level was measured using a competence test. An analysis of 514 tests revealed that the most neglected areas were the protection of children against unwanted communication with other users, and secure logging-in. The strongest component was the ergonomics of using ICT. We also noted that more than one fifth of parents showed a satisfactory level of DL related to online safety. Another observation was that DL is a complex and heterogeneous concept. The DL components are related with one another to different extents. Some DL elements are determined by the level of education, place of living, subjective sense of own well-being or intuitive perception (self-evaluation).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66019968, "asset_id": 45538589, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3162212, "first_name": "\u0141ukasz", "last_name": "Tomczyk", "domain_name": "jagiellonian", "page_name": "\u0141ukaszTomczyk", "display_name": "\u0141ukasz Tomczyk", "profile_url": "https://jagiellonian.academia.edu/%C5%81ukaszTomczyk?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3162212/1039670/20612405/s65__ukasz.tomczyk.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 491, "name": "Information Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Technology?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1909, "name": "Family studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2099, "name": "Information Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Society?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2246, "name": "Digital Literacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Literacy?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6423, "name": "Media Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Education?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 6574, "name": "Family", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 8280, "name": "Media Literacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Literacy?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 15735, "name": "Media Literacy Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Literacy_Education?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 303598, "name": "Parents", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Parents?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 69616577, "title": "Operation \u201cOlympic Games.\u201d Cyber-sabotage as a tool of American intelligence aimed at counteracting the development of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme", "created_at": "2022-01-27T04:11:08.864-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/69616577/Operation_Olympic_Games_Cyber_sabotage_as_a_tool_of_American_intelligence_aimed_at_counteracting_the_development_of_Iran_s_nuclear_programme?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_69616577", "summary": "The purpose of the article is to analyse Operation \u201cOlympic Games\u201d including, in particular, to indicate the political background to the activities aimed at preventing the development of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, and to examine the preparation and conduct of the operation, the involvement of the US and Israeli intelligence services, and the use of intelligence methods and sources.

It is a grafting of the theory of nuclear deterrence which underpinned and \u2018stabilised\u2019 the Cold War. In the modern era of \u2018new security challenges\u2019, especially those threats posed through the cyber-domain (cyber-espionage, cyber-warfare, cyber-attacks, computer network exploits/ attacks, hacking and cyber-vandalism, theft of industrial/ state secrets, and so on) deterrence has enjoyed a renaissance.\r\n\r\nThe argument is that deterrence by punishment as a theory worked under the auspices of the Cold War - when applied to cyber-warfare and the cyber-realm it becomes unfeasible, and in practice its ability to navigate and function within the virtual terrain is restricted. Its linearity and determinism mean that the underpinning assumptions of state-centrism, US/ Western state forms of rationality, and the omniscience implicit in \u2018knowing your enemy\u2019 do not, in the cyber-realm, fit (through the plurality of actors, range of targets and space for irrational actions or vandalism or folly) and therefore, centrally, the foundations which allow the theory to operate in reality cannot gain traction or make headway.

"Cybersecurity is a very emerging field that protects systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. With the increase in the scale of the Internet and the evolution of cyber attacks, developing novel cybersecurity tools has become important, particularly for Internet of things (IoT) networks. This paper provides a systematic review of the application of deep learning (DL) approaches for cybersecurity. This paper provides a short description of DL methods which is used in cybersecurity, including deep belief networks, generative adversarial networks, recurrent neural networks, and others. Next, we illustrate the differences between shallow learning and DL. Moreover, a discussion is provided on the currently prevailing cyber-attacks in IoT and other networks, and the effectiveness of DL methods to manage these attacks. Besides, this paper describes studies that highlight the DL technique, cybersecurity applications, and the source of datasets. Next, a discussion is provided on the feasibility of DL systems for malware detection and classification, intrusion detection, and other frequent cyber-attacks, including identifying file type, spam, and network traffic. Our review indicates that high classification accuracy of 99.72% is obtained by restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) when applied to a custom dataset, while long short-term memory (LSTM) achieves an accuracy of 99.80% for KDD Cup 99 dataset. Finally, this article discusses the importance of cybersecurity for reliable and practicable IoTdriven healthcare systems.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67896997, "asset_id": 49574682, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81114455, "first_name": "Subrato", "last_name": "Bharati", "domain_name": "buetcse", "page_name": "SubratoBharati", "display_name": "Subrato Bharati", "profile_url": "https://buetcse.academia.edu/SubratoBharati?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81114455/20229720/19950633/s65_subrato.bharati.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 465, "name": "Artificial Intelligence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Artificial_Intelligence?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54123, "name": "Artificial Neural Networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Artificial_Neural_Networks?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 81182, "name": "Deep Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deep_Learning?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2058532, "name": "Convolutional Neural Network [CNN]", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convolutional_Neural_Network_CNN_?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2952223, "name": "convolutional neural networks (CNNs)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/convolutional_neural_networks_CNNs_?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 11679184, "title": "ASCL Cyber Crime Investigation Manual", "created_at": "2015-03-26T22:59:01.562-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11679184/ASCL_Cyber_Crime_Investigation_Manual?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_11679184", "summary": "Orifinally published in 2001, this is the 2013 edition of the first of its kind cyber crime investigation manual in the world.

Dr. Matthew Crosston is the Senior Editor of the project, which aims to acquaint people with this critically undervalued region of the world. The analyses go far beyond the standard issue of energy and encapsulates economics, politics, culture, religion, global affairs, conflict and peace. \r\n\r\nThis edition of the Caspian Project testifies to the enormous wealth of analytical opportunity seen all across the region. While in the past we have enjoyed producing single-issue specializations (which we did over the past two weeks with The Russian Debate and The Persian Gambit, to great fanfare and applause), the true essence of the Project is to have great diversity for the readers every issue. No. 11 as it turns out is something of a hybrid of these two aspects: readers with this issue get quite a bit of diversity while also getting to enjoy a mini-specialization, as a number of the articles inside deal with different aspects of the Russian intelligence community, namely, the Federal Security Service or FSB. \r\n\r\nSo, on top of some very thought-provoking and hard-hitting articles dealing with the ethics, surveillance, and transnational activities of Russian intelligence, readers ALSO get to learn more in this issue about the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Turkmenistan\u2019s human rights record, and Kazakhstan\u2019s entrance into the WTO. It is an issue, therefore, that cuts across domestic politics, global affairs, security, economics, and international organizations. This is something we at Modern Diplomacy hold dearly when it comes to the Caspian Project: so much that is happening in the world today, affecting so many countries, transects in one way or another the greater Caspian sea region. It shall always be a hub of activity and importance, far beyond the standard call about energy and natural resources. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38497617, "asset_id": 14987587,

SQL injection attacks topped the list of Top 10 Network Security Problems released by OWASP, and the detection technology of SQL injection attacks has been one of the hotspots of network security research. In this paper, we propose a SQL injection detection method that does not rely on background rule base by using a natural language processing model and deep learning framework on the basis of comprehensive domestic and international research. The method can improve the accuracy and reduce the false alarm rate while allowing the machine to automatically learn the language model features of SQL injection attacks, greatly reducing human intervention and providing some defense against 0day attacks that never occur.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81034937, "asset_id": 71861549, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 211699196, "first_name": "Habib", "last_name": "Hamam", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HabibHamam1", "display_name": "Habib Hamam", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HabibHamam1?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 48, "name": "Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Engineering?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 118582, "name": "Physical sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Physical_sciences?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 403783, "name": "Attacks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Attacks?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1555613, "name": "SQL Injection Attacks (SQLIAs)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/SQL_Injection_Attacks_SQLIAs_?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 49355674, "title": "Sanctions and Cyberspace: The Case of the EU\u2019s Cyber Sanctions Regime", "created_at": "2021-06-24T03:24:05.292-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49355674/Sanctions_and_Cyberspace_The_Case_of_the_EU_s_Cyber_Sanctions_Regime?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_49355674", "summary": "Over the past years, the European Union has faced a number of cybersecurity challenges that range from\ncyberattacks to the critical infrastructure to cases of ransomware. In order to face these security challenges, the EU has\ndeveloped all the necessary strategies and policies, including the launch of the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox in 2017. This toolbox\nincludes among others, the policy instrument of cyber sanctions (Council Decision 2019/796 and Council Regulation\n2019/797). The purpose of this paper is to review the EU\u2019s cyber sanctions regime. In order to do that, we will apply key\nquestions that have arisen in the sanctions literature and apply them in the case of the EU. In particular, we will examine the\ntechnical, political and judicial parameters, which involve the implementations of cyber sanctions. Issues like the reliable\nattribution of cyberattacks, the clarifications of relevant norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace, the level of\ncooperation with the private sector and the scale and type of cyber sanctions are only some of the factors that will determine\nthe success of the cyber sanctions regime. Having established a clear theoretical framework on the implementation of cyber\nsanctions, we will briefly review the empirical evidence, which involves the sanctions package that the EU announced on 17\nMay 2019 and the amending version published on 30 July 2020, against various entities and individuals. The end goal is to\nreach a conclusion on whether cyber sanctions are of symbolic nature, or can be considered as an effective policy instrument\nfor the EU. This paper highlights the uses and limits of the EU cyber sanctions regime, which is a rather recent development\nand therefore under developed in the relevant literature.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67730021, "asset_id": 49355674, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 27788836, "first_name": "Eleni", "last_name": "Kapsokoli", "domain_name": "specisoft", "page_name": "elenikapsokoli", "display_name": "Eleni Kapsokoli", "profile_url": "https://specisoft.academia.edu/elenikapsokoli?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/27788836/21854349/85162936/s65_eleni.kapsokoli.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10347, "name": "European Union", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/European_Union?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 128908, "name": "Cyber Attack Attribution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Attack_Attribution?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 147937, "name": "Sanctions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sanctions?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1313527, "name": "Cybespace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybespace?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2508298, "name": "cyber sanctions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/cyber_sanctions?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 38688199, "title": "BLOCKCHAIN ET CYBERS\u00c9CURIT\u00c9", "created_at": "2019-04-01T20:20:17.187-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38688199/BLOCKCHAIN_ET_CYBERS%C3%89CURIT%C3%89?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_38688199", "summary": "\"Diffusion en direct autour de la blockchain et de la cybers\u00e9curit\u00e9.

attacks and cyber criminals against cyber-physical systems (CPSs), detecting these attacks remains challenging.

In general, DL delivers superior performance to ML because of its layered setting and its effective algorithm for extract useful information from training data. DL models are adopted quickly to cyber attacks against CPS systems. In this survey, a holistic view of recently proposed DL solutions is provided to cyber attack detection in the CPS context. A six-step DL driven methodology is provided to summarize and analyze the surveyed literature for applying DL methods to detect cyber attacks against CPS systems. The methodology includes CPS scenario analysis, cyber attack identification, ML problem formulation, DL model customization, data acquisition for training, and performance evaluation. The reviewed works indicate great potential to detect cyber attacks against CPS through DL modules. Moreover, excellent performance is achieved partly because of several high-quality datasets that are readily available for public use.

Attributing responsibility for malicious cyber-attacks is imperative if states are to respond and prevent the attacks from continuing. Unfortunately, due to both technical and legal issues attributing malicious cyber-attacks to the responsible state or non-state actor is difficult if not impossible in the vast majority of attacks. Even if an injured state may recursively trace the malicious cyber-attack to the responsible IP address, this is not enough under the current international customary law to hold a state or non-state actor responsible for the cyber-attack as it is virtually impossible to bridge the air gap between the computer system and end user to demonstrate affirmatively who initiated the attack. Even if a state could demonstrate the identity of the end user that initiated the attack, this is not enough to link the end user to the state for responsibility to lie under existing customary international law. As such this study was conducted to analyze the issue of malicious cyber-attacks as a matter of customary international law to ascertain mechanism to hold states responsible for malicious cyber-attacks which originate from a state\u2019s sovereign territory. Specifically, this study addresses the issue of legal and technical attribution of malicious cyber-attacks for the purposes of holding states responsible for those attacks. This study argues that under existing customary international law attributing malicious cyber-attacks for the purpose of ascertaining state responsibility is difficult if not impossible. As such, this study proposes alternative theories, which already exist within customary international law, for holding states responsible for malicious cyber-attacks which originate from their sovereign territory. This study addresses alternative theories of state responsibility existing in customary international law such as those put forth in Trail Smelter and Corfu Channel and the theory of strict liability for ultra-hazardous activities. In addition, this study addresses the theory of indirect responsibility, the duty to prevent harm, and due diligence in cyber-space. Lastly this study analysis the impact of the post-9/11 invasion of Afghanistan by the United States and NATO forces and determines that a burgeoning rule of attribution may be present which would impact the attribution of malicious cyber-attacks to states. This study makes an original and important addition to the corpus of international law by addressing the issues of technical and legal attribution, state responsibility, and the duty to prevent malicious cyber-attacks as a matter of customary international law. This study is needed; malicious cyber-attacks implicate international law, as the majority are interstate in nature. However, international law currently has no paradigm, per se, in place to effectively deal with the issue of malicious cyber-attacks.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54921643, "asset_id": 34962754, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 27923671, "first_name": "JD", "last_name": "Jolley", "domain_name": "glasgow", "page_name": "JDJolley", "display_name": "JD  Jolley", "profile_url": "https://glasgow.academia.edu/JDJolley?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/27923671/8244656/12146736/s65_jd.jolley.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2511, "name": "Cybercrimes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrimes?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2575, "name": "International Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Law?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25774, "name": "State Responsibility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/State_Responsibility?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 96546, "name": "Cyber Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 128908, "name": "Cyber Attack Attribution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Attack_Attribution?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 42116809, "title": "A Study of the UK Undergraduate Computer Science Curriculum: A Vision of Cybersecurity", "created_at": "2020-03-02T06:03:20.507-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42116809/A_Study_of_the_UK_Undergraduate_Computer_Science_Curriculum_A_Vision_of_Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_42116809", "summary": "When the content is not written in the discipline syllabus, it is possible that it will not be taught.

Because of their life-saving benefits, the devices are experiencing a dramatic growth in usage, application, and complexity. Yet, the rapid growth has precipitated an increase in cybersecurity risks and threats to the devices.  The literature posited that WIMD cybersecurity is a shared responsibility among manufacturers, healthcare providers, and patients.  What is not clear is what role a patient should play in WIMD cybersecurity and how a patient can assume such a role. The multiple case study examined: How are the cybersecurity risks and threats related to WIMDs being communicated to patients who have or will have these devices implanted in their bodies?  The population was cardiac device specialists at surgical hospitals and medical centers across the United States. The sample included 16 cardiac device specialists in the United States, each possessing at least one year of experience working with WIMD patients using in-home cardiac device monitoring systems. By using semistructured interviews with expert cardiac device specialists, the ideas, experiences, and perceptions of healthcare professionals responsible for the cybersecurity awareness and education of WIMD patients were examined. Through thematic analysis (TA), results yielded five themes: (a) the influence of the media on patient cybersecurity awareness, (b) the need for risk/benefit analysis at all levels of patient interaction, (c) a culture of noncommunication in the healthcare field and the medical device industry, (d) the need for collaboration and education among manufacturers, providers, and patients, and (e) the obstacles and challenges present in all phases of patient care.  Information gathered from healthcare professionals who worked intimately with the highly vulnerable WIMD patient population (cardiac device patients) provided valuable insights for medical device manufacturers, healthcare providers, policymakers, and patients across the WIMD macrocosm.  The research contributes scientific data to the body of knowledge in the field of WIMD cybersecurity and assists scholars and practitioners in advancing education and research in the field of healthcare cybersecurity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59937464, "asset_id": 39756293, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 118815704, "first_name": "George", "last_name": "Jackson, Jr.", "domain_name": "capella", "page_name": "GeorgeJackson", "display_name": "George W .

Virtualized network functions (VNFs) are used to provide services through software that replaces dedicated network devices. This shift from physical devices to software functions allows easier response and adaptation to environmental conditions (e.g. changes in network traffic or infrastructure). As such, they build the core of modern networks and are crucial to achieving the low latency and high speed of 5G networks. However, this makes VNFs of particular interest to cyber criminals, hacktivists, and state-sponsored hackers.\nIn October 2019, the EU Commission identified state-sponsored attackers as the major threat to the security of 5G networks. The EU\u2019s risk assessment identified core security requirements that are different for 5G networks. Due to the reliance on software, types of devices, and services connected and the heavily interconnected nature of 5G networks, there are more entry points for attackers. Nokia\u2019s head of product management security has said that 5G networks have 200 times more attack vectors than their 4G predecessors. Network services such as VIMs (virtualized infrastructure managers) have already been identified as crucial assets that are expected to be heavily attacked.\nThis article investigates how selected NATO and Western allies have addressed these issues of 5G network security over the past two years, while the pandemic has further highlighted societal dependency on network infrastructure.

Cyberdefense is heavily relaying on teamwork where members of Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) or Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) or Security Operations Center (SOC) teams are often geographically dispersed. In cybersecurity teamwork, computer supported collaboration is crucial as the team functions virtually in many ways. In this paper we present the results of interviews that were conducted with SOC exerts and we summarize the reviewed relevant literature. We have reviewed knowledge, skills, abilities and other characteristics (KSAOs) that make a team of cybersecurity experts capable to perform as virtual teams. These results revealed that to treat the cybersecurity team as a socio-technical system and supporting to cope with challenges of virtual teams helps them to be more effective and enhances employee retention.

Protection of military UAV assets rightly focuses on defence against sophisticated cyber penetration or electronic attack, including data link intercepts and navigational spoofing. Offensive activity to counter adversary drone operations presumes a requirement for high-end electronic attack systems. However, combat operations in eastern Ukraine in 2014-16 have introduced an entirely new dimension to UAV and counter-UAV operations. In addition to drones with military-grade standards of electronic defence and encryption, a large number of civilian or amateur UAVs are in operation in the conflict. This presents both opportunities and challenges to future operations combating hybrid threats. Actual operations in eastern Ukraine, in combination with studies of potential criminal or terrorist use of UAV technologies, provide indicators for a range of aspects of UAV use in future conflict. However, apart from the direct link to military usage, UAVs are rapidly approaching ubiquity with a wide range of applications reaching from entertainment purposes to border patrol, surveillance, and research, which imposes an indirect security and safety threat. Issues associated with the unguarded use of drones by the general public range from potentially highly dangerous situations such as failing to avoid controlled airspace, to privacy violations. Specific questions include attribution of UAV activities to the individuals actually directing the drone; technical countermeasures against hacking, interception or electronic attack; and options for controlling and directing adversary UAVs. Lack of attribution and security measures protecting civilian UAVs against electronic attack, hacking or hijacking, with the consequent likelihood of unauthorised use or interception, greatly increases the complication of each of these concerns.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 257331, "first_name": "Keir", "last_name": "Giles", "domain_name": "conflictstudies", "page_name": "KeirGiles", "display_name": "Keir Giles", "profile_url": "https://conflictstudies.academia.edu/KeirGiles?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/257331/197752/31563098/s65_keir.giles.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4810, "name": "Information Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Warfare?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4863, "name": "GPS Applications", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/GPS_Applications?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5821, "name": "Ukrainian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ukrainian_Studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46989, "name": "Ukraine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ukraine?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 52637, "name": "UAV and Aircraft control", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/UAV_and_Aircraft_control?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 153360, "name": "Electronic Attack", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Electronic_Attack?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 153371, "name": "Electronic Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Electronic_Warfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 167206, "name": "UAV systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/UAV_systems?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 189027, "name": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicle_UAV_?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 329707, "name": "Drones", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Drones?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 335460, "name": "Military Drones", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_Drones?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 335859, "name": "Design and Implementation of the Closed Loop Control of a Quad Rotor UAV for Stability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Design_and_Implementation_of_the_Closed_Loop_Control_of_a_Quad_Rotor_UAV_for_Stability?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 479632, "name": "UAV STABILITY AND CONTROL", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/UAV_STABILITY_AND_CONTROL?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 782428, "name": "Russian Military Strategy and Doctrine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian_Military_Strategy_and_Doctrine?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 852531, "name": "Legality of Use of Drones", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Legality_of_Use_of_Drones?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 882275, "name": "Drone Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Drone_Warfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1409051, "name": "Eastern Ukraine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eastern_Ukraine?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 30540210, "title": "CYBER SECURITY VULNERABILITIES: The Philippine Context", "created_at": "2016-12-20T07:24:51.271-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30540210/CYBER_SECURITY_VULNERABILITIES_The_Philippine_Context?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_30540210", "summary": "The prevalence of the use of information and communications technologies in the Philippines calls for a reassessment of the policies that protect the security of the people in cyberspace.

The goal should be to invest resources\nstarting on the left hand side of the scale and address those issues to achieve a proper return on investment before allocating significant resources to the other categories.\nThis approach recognizes the increasing cost of success to adversaries facing properly prepared organizations and empowers defenders to engage security in a manner that\nevolves over time.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39011900, "asset_id": 16479257, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13832977, "first_name": "Robert", "last_name": "Lee", "domain_name": "kcl", "page_name": "RobertLee", "display_name": "Robert Lee", "profile_url": "https://kcl.academia.edu/RobertLee?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13832977/3837423/6821613/s65_robert.lee.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11337, "name": "Cyber Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Warfare?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45580, "name": "Maturity Model", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maturity_Model?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 68860064, "title": "Detection of stealthy false-data injection attacks on safety-critical cyber-physical systems", "created_at": "2022-01-20T10:15:17.563-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/68860064/Detection_of_stealthy_false_data_injection_attacks_on_safety_critical_cyber_physical_systems?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_68860064", "summary": "Cybersecurity solutions ensuring tight access control are essential in preventing intrusions that could inflict devastating impacts on CPSs. In fact, many of these CPS applications are mission-critical: their failure can cause irreparable harm to the physical system being controlled and to people who depend on it. However, sole reliance on traditional access control or intrusion detection methods would be naive, given the large and complex attack surfaces of CPSs and the increasing sophistication of cyber adversaries. Therefore, CPSs security has received considerable interest from both the research community and industries. In this work we focused on anomaly detection methods for condition monitoring of CPSs analysing data-driven and model-based approaches. In both aforementioned approaches, unexpected behaviours are caused by anomalies that may arise because of security attacks on control, network, or physical layers, but they may also arise because of faults, noise, or human errors.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 95007375, "asset_id": 68860064, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 210481014, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Palma", "domain_name": "uniud", "page_name": "DavidPalma", "display_name": "David Palma", "profile_url": "https://uniud.academia.edu/DavidPalma?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/210481014/70078613/98459885/s65_david.palma.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2008, "name": "Machine Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Machine_Learning?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5476, "name": "Cyber-Physical Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber-Physical_Systems?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30596, "name": "Control Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Control_Systems?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 31349, "name": "Anomaly Detection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anomaly_Detection?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 36535, "name": "Safety-Critical Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Safety-Critical_Systems?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 354417, "name": "Dynamic Systems and Control", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dynamic_Systems_and_Control?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 516444, "name": "Cyber attacks, Cyber Fraud and Industrial Espionage: a new field of military activity, a field ahead.", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_attacks_Cyber_Fraud_and_Industrial_Espionage_a_new_field_of_military_activity_a_field_ahead?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 707524, "name": "Mission-Critical Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mission-Critical_Systems?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 897858, "name": "Industrial Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Industrial_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1491181, "name": "False Data Injection Attacks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/False_Data_Injection_Attacks?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2541016, "name": "Security and Resilience of Industrial Control Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_and_Resilience_of_Industrial_Control_Systems?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 3080693, "name": "Stealthy attacks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stealthy_attacks?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 43109473, "title": "EXAMINING THE CHALLENGES OF POLICING ECONOMIC CYBERCRIME IN THE UK", "created_at": "2020-05-19T13:05:00.315-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43109473/EXAMINING_THE_CHALLENGES_OF_POLICING_ECONOMIC_CYBERCRIME_IN_THE_UK?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_43109473", "summary": "Cybercrime has received the \u2018Tier One\u2019 national security risk status in many countries due to the increased cyber threats. In response to this severe threat, governments have announced a substantial amount of investment in cybercrime prevention programmes. It is evident that tackling cybercrime requires expertise and cybersecurity skills as the networked global nature of the Internet pose significant challenges to policing cybercrime. Previous policing cybercrime studies illustrated that local police officers lack the technical skills, which obviously hampered the fight against cybercrime. Police forces continue enhancing their ability to tackle cybercrime through specialised cybercrime units. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of empirical research examining policing problems of economic cybercrime through the lenses of expert police officers working in cybercrime departments. This empirical research addresses this knowledge gap in the literature. A thematic analysis method was employed to analyse semi-structured interviews conducted with expert police officers working at cybercrime departments in the United Kingdom. Lack of international cooperation, underreporting of economic cybercrime incidents and lack of victim awareness emerged as key challenges. Police officers\u2019 views regarding private sector involvement in policing economic cybercrime appear to be tentative due to ethical concerns. Public-private partnership in combatting cybercrime appears to be an effective solution to enhance the effectiveness of combatting cybercrime. European Union (EU)\u2019s new Cybersecurity Act (Regulation 2019/881), which restructures the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) is the latest example of public-private partnership in combatting cybercrime. However, the results of this study suggest that the scope of this initiative should be extended to non-EU countries to maintain global cybersecurity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63518796, "asset_id": 43109473, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 151313375, "first_name": "Naci", "last_name": "Akdemir", "domain_name": "jsga", "page_name": "NaciAkdemir", "display_name": "Naci Akdemir", "profile_url": "https://jsga.academia.edu/NaciAkdemir?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/151313375/44235451/34890882/s65_naci.akdemir.jpg"}, {"id": 4321944, "first_name": "B\u00fcrke", "last_name": "BA\u015eARANEL", "domain_name": "jsga", "page_name": "B\u00fcrkeBa\u015faranel", "display_name": "B\u00fcrke U BA\u015eARANEL", "profile_url": "https://jsga.academia.edu/B%C3%BCrkeBa%C5%9Faranel?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4321944/1731900/2073893/s65_burke.basaranel.jpg"}, {"id": 55634267, "first_name": "Bulent", "last_name": "Sungur", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SungurBulent", "display_name": "Bulent Sungur", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SungurBulent?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54342, "name": "Policing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Policing?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 67521, "name": "Public Private Partnership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Private_Partnership?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 89751, "name": "Cybercrime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrime?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3087385, "name": "Economic Cybercrime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_Cybercrime?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 42787859, "title": "Processo Gest\u00e3o de Riscos SegInfo (v3.0)", "created_at": "2020-04-19T11:21:08.604-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42787859/Processo_Gest%C3%A3o_de_Riscos_SegInfo_v3_0_?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_42787859", "summary": "O pensamento baseado em risco \u00e9 fundamental para as organiza\u00e7\u00f5es no \u00e2mbito da ado\u00e7\u00e3o de um sistema de gest\u00e3o da qualidade (e.g., ISO/IEC 9001), no planeamento e execu\u00e7\u00e3o de projetos (e.g., PMBOK; SCRUM), e tem enorme relev\u00e2ncia no \u00e2mbito da Seguran\u00e7a da Informa\u00e7\u00e3o (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001), da Ciberseguran\u00e7a (e.g., ISO/IEC 27032) e na prote\u00e7\u00e3o de dados pessoais (e.g., ISO/IEC 27701).

This is due to (a) the increased dependency on automated device, and (b) the inadequacy of general purpose Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to be deployed for special purpose networks usage. Numerous lightweight protocols are being proposed for IoT devices communication usage. One of the recent IoT machine-to-machine communication protocols is Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. However, as per the authors best knowledge, there are no available IDS datasets that include MQTT benign or attack instances and thus, no IDS experimental results available. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of six Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect MQTT-based attacks. Three abstraction levels of features are assessed, namely, packet-based, uni-directional flow, and bi-directional flow features. An MQTT simulated dataset is generated and used for the training and evaluation processes. The dataset is released with an open access licence to help the research community further analyse the challenges. The experimental results demonstrated the adequacy of the proposed ML models to suit MQTT-based networks IDS requirements. Moreover, the results emphasise on the importance of using flow-based features to discriminate MQTT-based attacks from benign traffic, while packet-based features are sufficient for traditional networking attacks .", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64783593, "asset_id": 44381071, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6369818, "first_name": "Xavier", "last_name": "Bellekens", "domain_name": "strathclyde", "page_name": "XavierBellekens", "display_name": "Xavier Bellekens", "profile_url": "https://strathclyde.academia.edu/XavierBellekens?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6369818/12896647/14284048/s65_xavier.bellekens.jpg"}, {"id": 76531492, "first_name": "Hanan", "last_name": "Hindy", "domain_name": "abertay", "page_name": "HananHindy", "display_name": "Hanan Hindy", "profile_url": "https://abertay.academia.edu/HananHindy?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/76531492/19045555/18995648/s65_hanan.hindy.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2009, "name": "Data Mining", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_Mining?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2345, "name": "Wireless Communications", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wireless_Communications?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3703, "name": "Network Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Network_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4252, "name": "Computer Networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Networks?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9136, "name": "Wireless Sensor Networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wireless_Sensor_Networks?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 49613, "name": "Network Intrusion Detection & Prevention", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Network_Intrusion_Detection_and_Prevention?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 247799, "name": "Internet of Things (IoT)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_of_Things_IoT_?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 296571, "name": "SNORT IDS Network", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/SNORT_IDS_Network?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1811470, "name": "MQTT", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/MQTT?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 43737988, "title": "E-Mail phishing detection using natural language processing and machine learning techniques", "created_at": "2020-07-29T07:09:24.885-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43737988/E_Mail_phishing_detection_using_natural_language_processing_and_machine_learning_techniques?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_43737988", "summary": "Today there are more than 4.39 billion internet users that almost 70 percent of them use social media on mobile devices.

These insights could also inform efforts to improve global governance institutions and processes more broadly. The brief considers two principal questions: Who should govern cyberspace, and how? In response to the former question, the authors review multistakeholder models of governance and provide recommendations for their improvement.\n\nThese include: greater transparency of decision-making processes, with a prohibition on vetoes; dedicating financial resources to the empowerment of is advantaged stakeholders; and allocating leadership positions in an equitable manner. In response to the latter question, the authors assess formal and informal approaches to governance in cyberspace, concluding that cyberspace should be governed through a combination of both. That is, a flexible, incremental and sectoral approach to strengthening the rule of law in cyberspace through international treaty-making should be complemented by efforts to build trust and consensus through the development, diffusion and institutionalization of norms for responsible behavior in cyberspace, as well as related confidence- and capacity-building measures. Taken together, these recommendations aim to foster common understanding and enhance security and the rule  of law in cyberspace. \n\nThis policy brief draws on The Hague Institute\u2019s work on the Global Governance Reform Initiative (GGRI) project and the Global Conference on Cyberspace (GCCS), hosted by the Kingdom of the Netherlands in April 2015. The GGRI project is a collaborative effort between The Hague Institute, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, and the Observer Research Foundation (New Delhi).",

due to both academic researches and incidents. There are academic studies that show vulnerabilities in various navigation equipments such as GPS, ECDIS, AIS and ARPA-Radar. Additionally, there are different cyber incidents around the world. \n\nDevelopments in technology, autonomous ship projects, academic studies and cyber incidents in the sector have triggered IMO. As per ISM Code, all shipping companies are mandatory to add \u201cGuidelines on Maritime Cyber Risk Management\u201d manual to their SMS manuals until 01st January 2021. \n\nBoth OCIMF and CDI failed to be indifferent to developments that are important for tanker operators as well as IMO. While OCIMF added cybersecurity-related questions to vetting programs called TMSA 3 and VIQ 7, CDI also added cybersecurity-related items in SIR 9.8.1 edition.\n\nOn the other hand, Rightship provides significant vetting service for dry cargo ships. \u201cInspection and Assessment Report\u201d is issued by Rigthship for dry cargo ships. Questions related with cybersecurity was added with Revision No: 11 dated on 11th May 2017 in \u201cInspection and Assessment Report\u201d.\n\nIn this study, cyber security related questions which are asked during TMSA, SIRE and CDI vettings which play a critical role for commercial life of tanker firms, were analyzed. Moreover, questions and efficiency of Rightship that offers vetting service for dry cargo ships, were assessed to maritime cyber security.\n\nAlso, cybersecurity-related questions in vetting questionnaires were interpreted by the author. These comments rely on benchmarking meetings among tanker operators where the author personally attended, and interview with key persons.\n\nNoted observations during vettings may negatively impact both commercial life and reputation of the tanker operators. That\u2019s why the firm names and interviewee names were kept confidential.\n\nIn this study, it was seen that although IMO demanded verification of cyber security-related implementations for the ship operators until 01st January 2021, this process started earlier for tanker operators.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61166888, "asset_id": 40879607, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 40236074, "first_name": "Aybars", "last_name": "Oruc", "domain_name": "ntnu-no", "page_name": "AybarsOruc", "display_name": "Aybars Oruc", "profile_url": "https://ntnu-no.academia.edu/AybarsOruc?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://gravatar.com/avatar/167ce155921d4cded2c00e48a0c80613?s=65"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 107015, "name": "Vetting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vetting?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3067274, "name": "Maritime Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 39042208, "title": "COMPROMISING SYSTEMS: IMPLEMENTING HACKING PHASES", "created_at": "2019-05-07T03:34:38.042-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39042208/COMPROMISING_SYSTEMS_IMPLEMENTING_HACKING_PHASES?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_39042208", "summary": "In the cyber world more and more cyber-attacks are being perpetrated.

Protection of military UAV assets rightly focuses on defence against sophisticated cyber penetration or electronic attack, including data link intercepts and navigational spoofing. Offensive activity to counter adversary drone operations presumes a requirement for high-end electronic attack systems. \n\nHowever, combat operations in eastern Ukraine in 2014-16 have introduced an entirely new dimension to UAV and counter-UAV operations. In addition to drones with military-grade standards of electronic defence and encryption, a large number of civilian or amateur UAVs are in operation in the conflict. This presents both opportunities and challenges to future operations combating hybrid threats. Actual operations in eastern Ukraine, in combination with studies of potential criminal or terrorist use of UAV technologies, provide indicators for a range of aspects of UAV use in future conflict. \n\nBut in addition to the direct link to military usage, UAVs are rapidly approaching ubiquity with a wide range of applications reaching from entertainment purposes to border patrol, surveillance, and research, which imposes an indirect security and safety threat. Issues associated with the unguarded use of drones by the general public range from potentially highly dangerous situations such as failing to avoid controlled airspace, to privacy violations. \n\nSpecific questions include attribution of UAV activities to the individuals actually directing the drone; technical countermeasures against hacking, interception or electronic attack; and options for controlling and directing adversary UAVs. Lack of attribution and security measures protecting civilian UAVs against electronic attack, hacking or hijacking, with the consequent likelihood of unauthorised use or interception, greatly increases the complication of each of these concerns.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46281198, "asset_id": 25921967, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

of this study is to explore the evolving technology and systems to find a low cost, efficient and portable solution for hard disk drive forensic imaging.Hard Disk Drive Imaging is one of the most frequently used forensic process which finds its application in both traditional as well as digital crimes and has found massive implementation in detecting cyber-crime incidents leading to cyber warfare. An empirical research was conducted using combination of hardware's like Intel NUC, Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, Custom Forensic Workstation (CFW), write blockers etc. and software's like ENCASE and FTK imager to do forensic imaging using multiple hard drives. A comparative analysis of the imaging process using same identical media over various platforms was done.The research shows that Raspberry Pi 3 Model B is a cost effective solution when a small device is to be imaged. Intel NUC with its i3 processor performs better than custom forensic work station with i7 processor when imaging using FTK Imager. The process of imaging involves many intricacies in order to prove the authenticity of evidence in a court of law. Problem in this regard arose when imaging was done using FTK on Linux and analyzed using ENCASE. The format generated on Linux and that recognized by ENCASE is different. The integrity of evidence is thus put to question. It was observed that not all components of each system are needed consecutively for the task of imaging. Consequently if a system is assembled with necessary components, it can help in further reducing the cost drastically.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55486993, "asset_id": 35618833,

Computers had gone from things that took rooms in academic research and government facilities to these small boxes that could sit on your desk. The power of this technology was just coming to light as well as people began to use them in their everyday lives. Officer workers went from using typewriters to word processing programs on computers. Information started to be stored in computer databases instead of large physical file rooms. Kids with a passion for this new technology found new ways to connect and access systems connected to phone lines and networks. The need for some type of security policy was first realized during this time period as the threat of loss or breach of data became a reality. The first federal statutes governing fraudulent computer access was not enacted until 1984, and it only applied to federal computer systems and systems owned by large financial institutions. This significant gap between legislation and reality caused many issues. Federal agencies were not securing their computer systems in a standardized and meaningful way while the bad guys were becoming more and more adept at entering computer systems without authorized access. The Computer Security Act of 1987 was on the first meaningful legislative acts that attempted to fill the gap between current federal computer security practices and the reality of the modern world.\n\nThe Computer Security Act of 1987 was a groundbreaking step by the federal government in recognizing the importance of computer security standards and plans, and it provided the basis for the future of the entire federal cybersecurity apparatus. This paper will discuss the history, components, application, and ultimate replacement of the Computer Security Act of 1987. This Act was the first of its kind and attempted to provide the groundwork for federal computer security and training as well as set the minimum standards for agencies\u2019 computer system security. The following discussion will attempt to illuminate this groundbreaking, but little known legislation, as it sought to close a known gap in federal policy. It will also discuss how it took more than a decade of undermining by the Executive Branch and numerous reports and testimony to Congress to demonstrate the need for an updated statute. Finally, knowing the flaws and failures of this Act, this paper will conclude with a brief discussion of the Act\u2019s ultimate replacement, Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37914517, "asset_id": 13004597, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6087149, "first_name": "Alexander", "last_name": "Schraut", "domain_name": "apus", "page_name": "AlexanderSchraut", "display_name": "Alexander Schraut", "profile_url": "https://apus.academia.edu/AlexanderSchraut?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6087149/2721470/3169487/s65_alexander.schraut.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3772, "name": "Legal History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Legal_History?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13923, "name": "Computer Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 61620, "name": "National Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 68613156, "title": "Biometric-Based Human Recognition Systems: An Overview", "created_at": "2022-01-18T07:34:55.651-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/68613156/Biometric_Based_Human_Recognition_Systems_An_Overview?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_68613156", "summary": "With the proliferation of automated systems for reliable and highly secure human authentication and identification, the importance of technological solutions in biometrics is growing along with security awareness. Indeed, conventional authentication methodologies, consisting of knowledge-based systems that make use of something you know (e.g., username and password) and token-based systems that make use of something you have (e.g., identification card), are not able to meet the strict requirements of reliable security applications. Conversely, biometric systems make use of behavioral (extrinsic) and/or physiological (intrinsic) human characteristics, overcoming the security issues affecting the conventional methods for personal authentication. This book chapter provides an overview of the most commonly used biometric traits along with their properties, the various biometric system operating modalities as well as various security aspects related to these systems. In particular, it will be discussed the different stages involved in a biometric recognition process and further discuss various threats that can be exploited to compromise the security of a biometric system. Finally, in order to evaluate the systems' performance, metrics must be adopted. The most widely used metrics are, therefore, discussed in relation to the provided system accuracy and security, and applicability in real-world deployments.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79042657, "asset_id": 68613156, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 210481014, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Palma", "domain_name": "uniud", "page_name": "DavidPalma", "display_name": "David Palma", "profile_url": "https://uniud.academia.edu/DavidPalma?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/210481014/70078613/98459885/s65_david.palma.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5109, "name": "Pattern Recognition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pattern_Recognition?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5380, "name": "Homeland Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homeland_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7439, "name": "Risk and Vulnerability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Risk_and_Vulnerability?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9173, "name": "Biometrics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biometrics?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 33361, "name": "Authentication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Authentication?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 63353, "name": "Identification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identification?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 253944, "name": "Terrorism and Homeland Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Terrorism_and_Homeland_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1988687, "name": "Evaluation Criteria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Evaluation_Criteria?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2494071, "name": "biometric characteristics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/biometric_characteristics?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 37682280, "title": "Cyber-Security Incidents: A Review Cases in Cyber-Physical Systems", "created_at": "2018-10-31T14:27:07.510-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37682280/Cyber_Security_Incidents_A_Review_Cases_in_Cyber_Physical_Systems?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_37682280", "summary": "Cyber-Physical Systems refer to systems that have an interaction between computers, communication channels and physical devices to solve a real-world problem. Towards industry 4.0 revolution, Cyber-Physical Systems currently become one of the main targets of hackers and any damage to them lead to high losses to a nation. According to valid resources, several cases reported involved security breaches on Cyber-Physical Systems. Understanding fundamental and theoretical concept of security in the digital world was discussed worldwide. Yet, security cases in regard to the cyber-physical system are still remaining less explored. In addition, limited tools were introduced to overcome security problems in Cyber-Physical System. To improve understanding and introduce a lot more security solutions for the cyber-physical system, the study on this matter is highly on demand. In this paper, we investigate the current threats on Cyber-Physical Systems and propose a classification and matrix for these threats, and conduct a simple statistical analysis of the collected data using a quantitative approach. We confirmed four components i.e., (the type of attack, impact, intention and incident categories) main contributor to threat taxonomy of Cyber-Physical Systems", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57672435, "asset_id": 37682280, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 32396185, "first_name": "NABEEL", "last_name": "ALI", "domain_name": "kuiraq", "page_name": "NabeelSalihAli", "display_name": "NABEEL ALI", "profile_url": "https://kuiraq.academia.edu/NabeelSalihAli?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/32396185/9698814/25070452/s65_nabeel.ali.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65430, "name": "Cyber Physical Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Physical_Systems?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 689759, "name": "Cyber Attacks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Attacks?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 43469365, "title": "Cyber Security in the Age of COVID-19: A Timeline and Analysis of Cyber-Crime and Cyber-Attacks during the Pandemic", "created_at": "2020-06-29T09:42:37.386-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43469365/Cyber_Security_in_the_Age_of_COVID_19_A_Timeline_and_Analysis_of_Cyber_Crime_and_Cyber_Attacks_during_the_Pandemic?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_43469365", "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic was a remarkable unprecedented event which altered the lives of billions of citizens globally resulting in what became commonly referred to as the new-normal in terms of societal norms and the way we live and work. Aside from the extraordinary impact on society and business as a whole, the pandemic generated a set of unique cyber-crime related circumstances which also affected society and business. The increased anxiety caused by the pandemic heightened the likelihood of cyber-attacks succeeding corresponding with an increase in the number and range of cyber-attacks. This paper analyses the COVID-19 pandemic from a cyber-crime perspective and highlights the range of cyber-attacks experienced globally during the pandemic. Cyber-attacks are analysed and considered within the context of key global events to reveal the modus-operandi of cyber-attack campaigns. The analysis shows how following what appeared to be large gaps between the initial outbreak of the pandemic in China and the first COVID-19 related cyber-attack, attacks steadily became much more prevalent to the point that on some days, 3 or 4 unique cyber-attacks were being reported. The analysis proceeds to utilise the UK as a case study to demonstrate how cyber-criminals leveraged key events and governmental announcements to carefully craft and design cyber-crime campaigns.",

signalled increased willingness to engage with Russia and China on cyber security issues. But this engagement will be extremely difficult to achieve in the absence of commonly agreed definitions, and even concepts, for what constitutes cyber security.\r\n\r\nRussian and Chinese doctrine and writing emphasise a very different set of security challenges to those which normally concern the US and UK. There is the additional complication of direct translations of specific terms from Russian and Chinese which resemble English-language terms, and therefore give the misleading impression of mutual understanding, while in fact referring to completely different concepts.\r\n\r\nA number of states including Russia and China, which do not subscribe to the Euroatlantic consensus on the nature and future of cyberspace, have already achieved a commonality in their views and language; while this language sometimes has no equivalent in English and is therefore imperfectly understood.\r\n\r\nThis paper examines these distinctions, comparing and contrasting terms and concepts in English, Russian and Chinese. This will illustrate the dangers involved in attempting to reach a consensus - or at the very least confidence and security building measures - with states with widely differing views on cyber security without first establishing a baseline of common definitions.

The convergence points identified in the article are: the protection of CIs as a strategic objective; the definition of what constitutes a CI; the services and facilities deemed CI; the existence of a national CI protection program; the need to congregate public and private stakeholders; and the need to build resilience into CI systems. The conclusion points out the countries that have shown through their NCSSs interest in international cooperation for the protection of CIs. This can be achieved by means of joint training, information exchange on threats and incidents against CIs, and in the medium term, the regulation of the use of cyberweapons against CIs.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66926614, "asset_id": 48213626, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 101293349, "first_name": "Rodrigo", "last_name": "Colli", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ColliRodrigo", "display_name": "Rodrigo Colli", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ColliRodrigo?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 22553445, "first_name": "Eduardo", "last_name": "Izycki", "domain_name": "unb", "page_name": "EduardoIzycki", "display_name": "Eduardo Izycki", "profile_url": "https://unb.academia.edu/EduardoIzycki?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/22553445/34563608/30328093/s65_eduardo.izycki.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3705, "name": "International Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11335, "name": "Cyber Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Conflict?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41862, "name": "Cyberwarfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberwarfare?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 56625, "name": "Critical Infrastructure Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Infrastructure_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 61620, "name": "National Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 81556, "name": "Critical infrastructure protection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_infrastructure_protection?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 7380266, "title": "Applying Memory Forensics to Rootkit Detection", "created_at": "2014-06-17T16:29:38.601-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7380266/Applying_Memory_Forensics_to_Rootkit_Detection?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_7380266", "summary": "Volatile memory dump and its analysis is an essential part of digital forensics. Among a number of various software and hardware approaches for memory dumping there are authors who point out that some of these approaches are not resilient to various anti-forensic techniques, and others that require a reboot or are highly platform dependent. New resilient tools have certain disadvantages such as low speed or vulnerability to rootkits which directly manipulate kernel structures e.g. page tables. A new memory forensic system \u2013 Malware Analysis System for Hidden Knotty Anomalies (MASHKA) is described in this paper. It is resilient to popular anti-forensic techniques. The system can be used for doing a wide range of memory forensics tasks. This paper describes how to apply the system for research and detection of kernel mode rootkits and also presents analysis of the most popular anti-rootkit tools.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

The westphalian state system is based on state sovereignty and borders, so the question that inevitably arises is whether states can define virtual borders and eventually construct an international legal framework that determines state sovereignty in cyberspace. A closer look at recent developments like the Chinese attempt to build their own internal internet, the role of internet filters in authoritarian regimes, the creation of the US Cyber Command and the debate for a global cyber-treaty, mark that the transition is already underway.

have increasingly affected the discipline of Security studies.\nWarfare is the first example heartened by technological improvements of the last decade. The race to new technologies and their deployment on the battlefield have affected warfare in all senses. This part will focus on the United States since they have focused their rearmament programmes on the integration of new technologies. In broader terms, the US can be considered as the protagonists of this new warfare era.\nThe so-called Revolution in Military Affairs is a pioneering theory that began in the United States of America which has focused on how to match a reform in the Army with the new technological improvements. This example is the first evidence to include in my analysis to assess to what extent technology has contributed to change warfare and thus how it has affected Military Security.\nThe most striking case to assess the relationship (if any) between security and technology is the Pakistan intervention by the US in 2004. In that case, the United States have deployed Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (e.g. the drones) and new technologies on the battlefield. Especially, drones have had optimal results in the battlefield, however they also have \u201cshaken\u201d the public opinion in the US. This gives further reasons to prove that the RMA is still in act but that overall, the relationship between security and technology has some ambiguities.\nIn the first part of my work, I expect to show not just how the logic and the essence of war has been affected by technology, but also how, in a wider sense, to trace the roots of the relationship between technology and security is possible.\nThe second part of this work will deal with cybersecurity\nPrecisely, the case of Edward Snowden and the investigative report of The Guardian are an interesting point of departure to assess how and to what extent technology has affected the practices of surveillance. Through its revelations, Snowden has revealed an ambiguous pattern between the use of information in the hands of the National Security Agency of the United States. The reaction of the public has been ambivalent: American citizens have considered Snowden as a \u201chero\u201d and as a \u201ctraitor\u201d. Overall, this case shows how new technologies have turned the practices of surveillance in an ambiguous area.\nThe final part would include the case of economic security and the virtual currencies. In particular, Bitcoins can be an example on to what extent a technological improvement can both disturb and support the functioning of world Economy. Bitcoins are a technological advancement for economic security. However, the encryption system by which they work, Blockchain, makes the identity of the purchase almost untraceable. Down to these two features, anonymity and inviolability, Bitcoins can be used by criminals for illegal practices. Therefore, Bitcoins are a further example to emphasise that the relationship between security and technology is ambiguous.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59025459, "asset_id": 38924921,

"summary": "Cyber attacks target everyone, including small companies, large companies, government agencies, executives, and even salespeople. Cyber criminals are using sophisticated methods to gain unauthorized access to information systems to steal sensitive data, Personality Identifiable Information (PII), or even classified materials. Some of the creative methods that attackers use to gain unauthorized access are backdoor programs, social engineering, and Ransomware. Ransomware, as the name implies, is software that encrypts files, and then requires payment of ransom in order for a person to be re-granted access to their restricted files; thus, ransomware is an access-denial type of attack that prevents legitimate users from accessing files. While threats and ransomware attacks cannot be eliminated, use of the defense-in-layers security strategy is the best approach in reducing the chance of devices getting infected with the malware. Defense-in-layers advocates applying security measures in separate but overlapping protections to ensure the implementation of a solid security posture. The security layers are designed to complement each other by ensuring that a vulnerability which is not mitigated in one layer is mitigated by a different control available in another layer.

General two factor authentication by entering an email or username with a password are similar. However, two factor authentication requires additional information that must be inputted by the user. Additional information can be in the form of tokens or one-time passwords (OTP). Two factor authentications generally still uses third-party services to generate token or OTP still have vulnerable because can attacked from tokens steal through MITM and found that the generated tokens with the same value. Therefore, we propose a two-factor authentication framework based on ethereum blockchain with dApp as token generation system. Firstly, outcome from the analysis of the system, next succeeded in creating a two-factor authentication system without using third-parties. Second, token system generate up to 3164 different tokens  in one second and has been collisions tested. Third, security method to protect token from MITM attack.

Recently, big data companies like Google, Amazon and Apple, as well as social networks like Facebook and Twitter, have been making forays into the financial services market, capitalizing on their massive troves of user data and social information. Providing the first in-depth study of big data and social netbanks, this Article analyzes these players\u2019 entry into the financial services market and surveys the current regulatory framework for those new bank-like entities. Despite the large numbers of technology companies offering financial services and their massive pool of subscribers, regulation of online nonbanks currently consists of a hodgepodge of statutes and regulations. In particular, as this Article shows, existing regulation does not differentiate between this recently emerging form of bank-like services and other online/mobile nonbanks. As big data and social netbanks increasingly eat at the edges of the traditional banking market, this Article makes a key descriptive contribution by presenting a comprehensive analysis of the new entrants. This Article also makes a significant normative contribution by listing the distinctive characteristics of big data and social netbanks and other issues that regulators should be mindful of when designing an appropriate regulatory scheme. These characteristics and issues include consumers\u2019 access to financial services, social consequences, competition in the financial market, cybersecurity, privacy, and specific consumers\u2019

In recent years, there has been an increase in popularity for applications that implement AI and ML technology. As with traditional\ndevelopment, software testing is a critical component of an efficient AI/ML application. However, the approach to development methodology used in AI/ML varies significantly from traditional development.\nOwing to these variations, numerous software testing challenges occur. This paper aims to recognize and to explain some of the biggest challenges that software testers face in dealing with AI/ML applications. For future research, this study has key implications. Each of the challenges outlined in this paper is ideal for further investigation and has great potential to shed light on the way to more productive software testing strategies and methodologies that can be applied to AI/ML applications.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66149369, "asset_id": 45651057, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 19082339, "first_name": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence & Applications", "last_name": "(IJAIA)", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "IjaiaJournal", "display_name": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence & Applications (IJAIA)", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/IjaiaJournal?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/19082339/5301872/82722296/s65_international_journal_of_artificial_intelligence_applications._ijaia_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 465, "name": "Artificial Intelligence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Artificial_Intelligence?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2008, "name": "Machine Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Machine_Learning?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2009, "name": "Data Mining", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_Mining?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2482, "name": "Database Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Database_Systems?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4205, "name": "Data Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_Analysis?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 4761, "name": "Software Testing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Software_Testing?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 8128, "name": "Data Communications", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_Communications?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 8422, "name": "Adaptive Control", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Adaptive_Control?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 27360, "name": "Databases", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Databases?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 36365, "name": "Middleware", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middleware?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 45088, "name": "Data Structures and Algorithms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 47980, "name": "Data Visualization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_Visualization?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 69100, "name": "Data Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_Science?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 92007, "name": "Privacy and data protection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Privacy_and_data_protection?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 97108, "name": "Data Privacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_Privacy?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 211970, "name": "MAchine Learning Algorithms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/MAchine_Learning_Algorithms?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 362017, "name": "Incomprehensibility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Incomprehensibility?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 983429, "name": "Philosophy of Mind and Artificial Intelligence & AI", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_Mind_and_Artificial_Intelligence_and_AI?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1013662, "name": "Middleware Functions of the Distributed Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middleware_Functions_of_the_Distributed_Systems?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 33195001, "title": "Ciberseguran\u00e7a, aula 5, Ciberseguran\u00e7a.

When ransomware encrypts storage sytems, systems shutdown, productivity grinds to a halt, and serious long-term damage takes place. As this is a known problem many firms have developed functionality to address ransomware issues in key security technologies such as intrusion protection systems. Many firms, especially smaller ones, may not have access to these technologies or perhaps the integration of these technologies might not yet be possible due ot varying circumstances. Regardless, ransomware must still be addressed as cyber miscreants actually target weak and unprotected environment. Even without tools that automate and aggregrate security capability, systems administrators can use systems utilities, applications, and digital forensic techniques to detect ransomware and defend their environemnts.

cyber-politics. But how do they play out in the case of the European Union, who claims influence in European and global cyberspace? This article dissects different existing conceptualizations of cyber-power in order to understand where they come from, what they mean, and what they do. It then searches the European Union's cyber-security policy for different manifestations of that power. The aim of the article is twofold: One the one hand, it does groundwork for a more academic approach to questions of cyber-power, by presenting possible frameworks for analysis and by identifying issues and challenges for such an undertaking. On the other, it takes discussions about Europe's cyber-power a step further, by offering alternative readings of cyber-power in a specific European context, thereby stimulating a broader discussion beyond the question of how much cyber-power the EU has and focus rather on the kind of cyber-power it has", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55632044, "asset_id": 35756343, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 350006, "first_name": "Myriam", "last_name": "Dunn Cavelty", "domain_name": "ethz", "page_name": "MyriamCavelty", "display_name": "Myriam Dunn Cavelty", "profile_url": "https://ethz.academia.edu/MyriamCavelty?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/350006/94486/302631/s65_myriam.dunn_cavelty.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 982, "name": "Cyberlaw", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberlaw?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10347, "name": "European Union", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/European_Union?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11337, "name": "Cyber Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Warfare?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27137, "name": "European Union Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/European_Union_Politics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 59103, "name": "Cyberpolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberpolitics?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 25426080, "title": "Pros & Cons of Honeypots", "created_at": "2016-05-18T06:14:14.646-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/25426080/Pros_and_Cons_of_Honeypots?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_25426080", "summary": "Honeypot usage, benefits and disadvantages of implementing a honeypot on your network.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45743054, "asset_id": 25426080, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 47336306, "first_name": "Jonathan", "last_name": "Avery", "domain_name": "umgc", "page_name": "JonathanAvery", "display_name": "Jonathan Avery", "profile_url": "https://umgc.academia.edu/JonathanAvery?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/47336306/12491215/30352365/s65_jonathan.avery.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48487, "name": "Network and Mobile IPv6 Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Network_and_Mobile_IPv6_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53361, "name": "Computer Networking and Telecommunication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Networking_and_Telecommunication?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120389, "name": "Intrusion Detection Systems and Honeypots", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intrusion_Detection_Systems_and_Honeypots?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 14001344, "title": "Electronic Health Record Systems and CyberSecurity Challenges", "created_at": "2015-07-13T12:32:45.911-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14001344/Electronic_Health_Record_Systems_and_CyberSecurity_Challenges?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_14001344", "summary": "Research findings have revealed that our world today is greatly influenced by the digital cyberspace and the corresponding information flow resulting in huge societal and economic impacts. Cyberspace offers an imagined place or notional realm in which electronic information exists or is exchanged. The explosion of the Internet has placed increasing demands on businesses, industries, commerce, government, education, entertainment and health, thereby creating vulnerabilities within the cyberspace and increasing criminal, hostile actions and potential threats. In the health sector, application of Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs) provide a means to sustain patient safety and care while allowing better efficiency in the exchange of information, but with the risk of privacy violation and identity theft. In view of the foregoing, developing economies especially in sub-Saharan Africa, seem reluctant to key into this aspect of healthcare management, which has harmed greatly certain initiatives to implement and sustain healthcare schemes. Whereas consensus efforts have been made to stem the tide, such as the exploration of threat combative mechanisms such as cryptography; a technique that can maintain authentication, integrity, availability, confidentiality, identification and privacy of data by encryption and decryption, the cyber-security war cannot be said to have been won. Other security means involve the integration of privacy settings into hardware and the use of biometrics. This research focuses on the various challenges that exist in today's cyberspace, especially the impact observed in the medical and healthcare field, with respect to securing information and harnessing steps, that could be implemented to mitigate and if possible, totally eradicate the causes and effects, and consequently suggest action steps which developing economies can adopt in implementing robust EHR systems.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38177609, "asset_id": 14001344, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 27351317, "first_name": "Ernest", "last_name": "Onuiri", "domain_name": "babcockuni", "page_name": "ErnestOnuiri", "display_name": "Ernest Onuiri", "profile_url": "https://babcockuni.academia.edu/ErnestOnuiri?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/27351317/7776459/20980414/s65_ernest.onuiri.jpg"}, {"id": 4844532, "first_name": "Komolafe", "last_name": "Oyindolapo", "domain_name": "babcockuni", "page_name": "KomolafeOyindolapo", "display_name": "Komolafe O Oyindolapo", "profile_url": "https://babcockuni.academia.edu/KomolafeOyindolapo?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4844532/2073540/85070913/s65_komolafe.oyindolapo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 128903, "name": "Health Informatics, Medical Informatics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Health_Informatics_Medical_Informatics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 43120076, "title": "CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) -'ZOOM' APPLICATION BOON OR BANE", "created_at": "2020-05-20T14:27:35.336-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43120076/CORONAVIRUS_COVID_19_ZOOM_APPLICATION_BOON_OR_BANE?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_43120076", "summary": "Advances in communication technologies offer new opportunities for the conduct of qualitative research.

post-Cold War era, especially in the second half of the 1990's, the planning of all states, especially the United States of America (USA) have inc-reased in order to establish the activity in the area which is called cyber space asa result of the acceleration of the internet's process of civilization and commercialization. \n\nWithin the scope of the goal of developing the cyber attack capacity of the USA, it is seen that the USA has established new structures which are ca-pable of planning cyber activities in the the existing intelligence and security institutions and also constituted new organizations in order to strengthened her defense capacity.\n\n In this context, institutional structures that play a role in the USA's capa-city for cyber defense and attack will be analyzed by examining the authorities, responsibilities and activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) and the National Security Agency (NSA) in this study.\n\n Key words: The United States of America, Cyber Space, Cyber Capacity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55407972,

The combination of telecommuting and video conferencing comes with the benefits of reduced overhead, increased productivity and minimal risks of exposure to infectious diseases including the COVID-19 which is spread through human clusters. Unfortunately, the popularity of telecommuting and video conferencing applications has also opened up potential avenues for cyber-attacks and other hostile hacking incidents that target porous networks and unsafe systems and applications, thereby raising serious ethical, cyber security and privacy concerns. This paper examines a comprehensive overview of cyber security issues related to telecommuting and video conferencing applications including their vulnerabilities, threats, and impacts.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63860497, "asset_id": 43549966, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 149619212, "first_name": "Kenneth", "last_name": "Okereafor", "domain_name": "universidadazteca", "page_name": "Kenneth_Okereafor", "display_name": "Kenneth Okereafor", "profile_url": "https://universidadazteca.academia.edu/Kenneth_Okereafor?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/149619212/42867393/36275642/s65_kenneth.okereafor.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 87, "name": "Telecommunications Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Telecommunications_Engineering?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26860, "name": "Cloud Computing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cloud_Computing?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43409, "name": "Video Conferencing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Video_Conferencing?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 181551, "name": "Cloud Computing Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cloud_Computing_Security-1?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 197132, "name": "Cloud Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cloud_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 265348, "name": "Teleconferencing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teleconferencing?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 285072, "name": "Telecommuting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Telecommuting?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 845649, "name": "Zooming", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zooming?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 989727, "name": "Web Video Conferencing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Web_Video_Conferencing?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1251967, "name": "Working from home", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Working_from_home?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 3594697, "name": "COVID-19 PANDEMIC", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/COVID-19_PANDEMIC?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 35775478, "title": "PROTECCI\u00d3N DE INFRAESTRUCTURAS CR\u00cdTICAS GU\u00cdA PARA LA ELABORACI\u00d3N DE PLANES DE SEGURIDAD DEL OPERADOR Y PLANES DE PROTECCI\u00d3N ESPEC\u00cdFICA AGRUPACI\u00d3N EMPRESARIAL INNOVADORA PARA LA SEGURIDAD DE LAS REDES Y LOS SISTEMAS DE INFORMACI\u00d3N", "created_at": "2018-01-28T03:24:15.742-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35775478/PROTECCI%C3%93N_DE_INFRAESTRUCTURAS_CR%C3%8DTICAS_GU%C3%8DA_PARA_LA_ELABORACI%C3%93N_DE_PLANES_DE_SEGURIDAD_DEL_OPERADOR_Y_PLANES_DE_PROTECCI%C3%93N_ESPEC%C3%8DFICA_AGRUPACI%C3%93N_EMPRESARIAL_INNOVADORA_PARA_LA_SEGURIDAD_DE_LAS_REDES_Y_LOS_SISTEMAS_DE_INFORMACI%C3%93N?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_35775478", "summary": "Esta Gui\u0301a recoge, en base a mejores pra\u0301cticas nacionales e internacionales un resumen de recomendaciones para implantar las medidas de seguridad identificadas en los Planes de Protecci\u00f3n de Ciberseguridad que consideramos que sera\u0301 de gran intere\u0301s para aquellas organizaciones interesados en al proteccio\u0301n de las infraestructuras cri\u0301ticas y, en especial de los operadores cri\u0301ticos.\nDada la importancia que tienen los sistemas SCADA en este tipo de entornos, se ha incluido un anexo especial dedicado especi\u0301ficamente al aseguramiento de dicho tipo de sistemas.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55651861, "asset_id": 35775478, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7641524, "first_name": "F\u00e9lix Antonio", "last_name": "Barrio Ju\u00e1rez", "domain_name": "unileon", "page_name": "F\u00e9lixAntonioBarrioJu\u00e1rez", "display_name": "F\u00e9lix Antonio Barrio Ju\u00e1rez", "profile_url": "https://unileon.academia.edu/F%C3%A9lixAntonioBarrioJu%C3%A1rez?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7641524/14985499/15729984/s65_f_lix_antonio.barrio_ju_rez.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 24437, "name": "Critical Infrastructure Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Infrastructure_Systems?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 243726, "name": "Critical Information Infrastructure Protection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Information_Infrastructure_Protection?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 41447000, "title": "Impact of Data Breaches to Organizations and Individuals -

Despite the centrality of cyber-incidents in the cyber-security discourse, researchers have yet to understand their link to, and effects on politics. This article closes this gap by combining ANT insights with an empirical examination of a prominent cyber-incident (i.e., Stuxnet). It demonstrates that the disruptive practices of cyber-security caused by malicious software (malware), lie in their ability to actively perform three kinds of space (regions, networks, and fluids), each activating different types of political interventions. The article posits that the fluidity of malware challenges the consistency of networks and the sovereign boundaries set by regions, and paradoxically, leads to a forceful re-enactment of them. In this respect, the conceptualization of fluidity as an overarching threat accounts for multiple policy responses and practices in cyber-security as well as attempts to (re)-establish territoriality and borders in the virtual realm. While this article concentrates on cyber-security, its underlying ambition is to indicate concretely how scholars can profitably engage ANT\u2019s concepts and methodologies",

Al paso que ha aumentado la tecnologi\u0301a van apareciendo y crea\u0301ndose nuevas amenazas que ponen en peligro la ciberseguridad de las naciones. Para analizar las amenazas ciberne\u0301ticas es impor- tante enfocarse en te\u0301rminos de su origen, es decir, de donde provienen. Las ciberamenazas pueden derivarse de un espectro amplio de fuentes, que van desde una sola persona como un hacker solitario, pasando por un empleado descontento, los cibercriminales y ciberterroristas y llegando hasta el empleo de las capacidades de una o varios Estados-nacio\u0301n para conducir un ataque encubierto, coordinado y dina\u0301mico a un adversario.

A VA can throw a lot of false positives and false negatives too, which is often tested manually by administrators to confirm.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The working hypothesis refers to assumption that current regulations and security solutions for Business Intelligence analytics based on the processing of large sets of information with the use of sentiment analysis and Big Data is under extreme preassure to meet evergrowing challenges. There are more and more dends form the legal regulators as well as from the market and that creates a lot of problems with data protection. The article uses legal and comparative analysis as well as structural and functional analysis. Additionally, the interpretation method is also present. Findings: Article indicates that the aforementioned issues with the respect to growing importance of internet including the Internet of Things and Internet of Everything are becoming of more and more importance and cannot go with appropriate level of cybersecurity since the data they collect is of the great importance. The trends immanent to Industry 4.0 require from business more effort and customer orientation. Growing population and access to Internet demands larger scales of business operations. Practical Implications: As a result of conducting the research, it is possible to identify threats and present some recommendations for cybersecurity of Business Intelligence. Originality/Value: This is a complete research for Cybersecurity of Business Intelligence analytics based on the processing of large sets of information with the use of sentiment analysis and Big

Cyberterrorism. Hybrid conflicts have replaced the traditional ones, and new threats have emerged in cyberspace, which has become a virtual battlefield. Cyber threats-cybercrimes, cyberterrorism, cyberwarfare-are a major concern for Western governments, especially for the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The international community has begun to consider cyberattacks as a form of terrorism, to which the same measures apply. Because the term \"terrorism\" is ambiguous and legaly undefined, there is no consensus on a definition of the derivative term \"cyberterrorism\", which is left to the unilateral interpretations of states. Pretending to consider the cyberspace domain as traditional domains, and claiming to apply IHL for the sole purpose of lawfully using armed forces in contrast to cyberterrorism is a stretch. This paper addresses the question of whether or not current laws of war and international humanitarian law apply to cyber domain, and gives some recommendations on how to tackle this issue.",

The application of information security technical solutions does not always result in improved security. The human factor is more likely to cause serious information security breaches than technical vulnerabilities. In the local context, the human factor has been found to lack interest from the research community, with most information security research giving focus on the management and technological component of Information Security. The aim of this research is to identify and focus on the human factor of the organisation, which affects the information security. This research tries to explore and understand employees' role in information security in public licensed commercial banks focusing on human factors that contributes towards information security. The purpose is to achieve a better understanding of the importance of the human factor in ensuring and improving the information security of public licensed commercial banks in Sri Lanka. The analysis indicated that a main problem regarding users' role in the information security work is their lack of motivation and knowledge regarding information security and related work. This specifies the need to increase the quality of the users' role and responsibility. Secondly, the existing approaches at the studied public banks, documentation and awareness sessions, have no considerable effect on users' behaviour and awareness. Third, in order to cope with conflicting issues of information security and other work tasks, it is argued for new approaches that influence users' risk perception and safe behaviour. Participants demand for more user involving approaches in the information security work in their respective banks. This call for humanistic information security management approach which builds awareness and confidence, improving knowledge and utilize balanced risk communication in direct contact with the employees.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62667042, "asset_id": 42488747, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 152025025, "first_name": "Sahan", "last_name": "Weerasinghe", "domain_name": "cmb", "page_name": "SahanWeerasinghe", "display_name": "Sahan Weerasinghe", "profile_url": "https://cmb.academia.edu/SahanWeerasinghe?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/152025025/42268139/36316104/s65_sahan.weerasinghe.jpg"}, {"id": 3571079, "first_name": "Janaka", "last_name": "Wijayanayake", "domain_name": "kln", "page_name": "JanakaWijayanayake", "display_name": "Janaka I Wijayanayake", "profile_url": "https://kln.academia.edu/JanakaWijayanayake?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1580, "name": "Cyberpsychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberpsychology?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8350, "name": "Human Information Behavior", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Information_Behavior?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45500, "name": "Information System Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_System_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 56710, "name": "Social Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Engineering?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 188416, "name": "Socio-Technical Research in Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socio-Technical_Research_in_Information_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 265411, "name": "Information Technology and Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Technology_and_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 679354, "name": "Information Security Awareness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security_Awareness?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1775240, "name": "Information Security Management System", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security_Management_System?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2184521, "name": "Human Aspects of Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Aspects_of_Information_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 3606552, "name": "Human aspects in Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_aspects_in_Security?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 24359488, "title": "The Rise of Non-State Actors in Cyberwarfare", "created_at": "2016-04-13T03:23:30.062-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24359488/The_Rise_of_Non_State_Actors_in_Cyberwarfare?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_24359488", "summary": "This chapter focuses on the rise of non-state actors in cyberwarfare and its impact on international law.

The second part evaluates the challenges to international law posed by the non-state actors' involvement in this new paradigm of warfare. It considers how their participation in cyberwar may be covered by the traditional corpus of norms regulating armed conflicts.

Cyber intelligence is gaining importance more today. Countries began to create cyber intelligence units in their intelligence departments. Reaching needed information from social media data stacks is possible with using different programs and algorithms in accordance with requirements. Social media sites which are very important for intelligence can be analyzed with commercial, academical or security purposes. In this study, an event which is discussed very much in Turkey on social media was analyzed. Accesing information and visualization was made on data. Some meaningful results were reached. In Turkey TT list, plenty of sharing is done for advertising purposes. First, data cleaning process was performed in the data to reach the actual data. When data was cleaned from URL's and hashtags, more meaningful information were accessed. During analysis, it has been seen that community memory is able to establish a bridge among similar events. Also high centrality of data which includes mentions showed that some users and twits are serving like bridges between a lot of different users.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65117872, "asset_id": 30878927, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 58774231, "first_name": "Serkan", "last_name": "Sava\u015f", "domain_name": "kirikkaleturkey", "page_name": "SerkanSava\u015f", "display_name": "Serkan Sava\u015f", "profile_url": "https://kirikkaleturkey.academia.edu/SerkanSava%C5%9F?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/58774231/29581772/27515475/s65_serkan.sava_.jpg"}, {"id": 58560982, "first_name": "Nurettin", "last_name": "Topaloglu", "domain_name": "gazi", "page_name": "NurettinTopaloglu", "display_name": "Nurettin  Topaloglu", "profile_url": "https://gazi.academia.edu/NurettinTopaloglu?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/58560982/15439009/18734492/s65_nurettin.topaloglu.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2674, "name": "Intelligence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intelligence?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 73353, "name": "Social Media Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media_Analysis?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 799133, "name": "Nodexl", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nodexl?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1144590, "name": "Siber G\u00fcvenlik", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Siber_Guvenlik?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1708292, "name": "Istihbarat", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Istihbarat?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1880549, "name": "cyberintelligence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/cyberintelligence?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2562765, "name": "Sosyal Medya Analizi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sosyal_Medya_Analizi?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2655049, "name": "siber istihbarat", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/siber_istihbarat?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 37542832, "title": "A SURVEY ON LATEST TRENDS AND CHALLENGES IN CYBER FORENSICS", "created_at": "2018-10-06T21:42:28.957-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37542832/A_SURVEY_ON_LATEST_TRENDS_AND_CHALLENGES_IN_CYBER_FORENSICS?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_37542832", "summary": "Digital forensics has become increasingly important as an approach to investigate cyber and computer-assisted crime.

The cases of cyber-attacks are on the rise, posing threats to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems including the mobile wallet transactions. Due to the adverse impacts of cyber-attacks on the mobile payment service providers and the users, as well as the risks associated with the use of information systems, performing risk management becomes imperative for business organizations. This research work focuses on the assessment of the vulnerabilities associated with mobile wallet transactions and performs an empirical risk management in order to derive the security priority level needed to ensure the security and privacy of the users of mobile wallet platforms. Based on the extensive literature review, a structured questionnaire was designed and administered to the mobile wallet users who are Paga student customers via the internet. A total number of 52 respondents participated in the research and their responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The results of the analysis show that mobile wallet Login details are the most important part of customer information that need to be highly protected as their compromise is likely to affect others. Also, customers' information such as Mobile Wallet Account Number, Registered Phone Number, Linked ATM Card details, and Linked ATM Card PIN among others are also plausible to attacks. Hence, different security priority levels were derived to safeguard each of the components and possible security tools and mechanisms are recommended. The study also revealed that there are vulnerabilities from the mobile wallet users end that also pose threat to the security of the payment system and customers' transaction which need to be properly addressed.

With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), every compromised device has potential to become soldier or adversary.  It has become a necessity for each state to have its own separate individual cyber security policy. In 2003 the United States of America (USA) was first to understand the significance of cyber security policy and was the first country in the world to have a cyber-security policy. Cyberspace communication exposes countries to various challenges. This can be tackled by states by drafting and implementing effective cyber security policies. This project critically analysis the recent National Cyber Security Policies (NCSP\u2019s) of UK, India, USA and Germany. The documents will be analysed in the light of derived framework. This project intends to do the comparative analysis for academic purposes only and can act as a stepping stone for bridging gaps in cyber security policies.

"summary": "Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems, including hardware, software and \ndata, from cyberattacks. Cybersecurity culture is a set of the attitudes, assumptions, beliefs, values \nand knowledge that people use in their interaction with the information assets. In Zimbabwe not \nmuch has been done in terms of cultivating a culture of cyber security in organisations although \ngiant steps have been taken to adopt and use ICTs. The lack of a framework to provide direction, \nfocus, guidance and a standardised way of addressing cybersecurity issues in Zimbabwe is one of the \nchallenges being faced in the ICT industry. With no cybersecurity framework in place, dealing with \ncybersecurity issues becomes problematic as there is no guidance and direction on how to prevent, \nrespond and reduce cybersecurity breaches and risk as well as improve personnel awareness. A \ncybersecurity framework that will support a cybersecurity culture to prevent cyber-attacks in \nZimbabwe is therefore required under these circumstances. The research question is \u201cHow can a \ncyber security culture framework be developed to solve cybersecurity problems for grassroot users \nof cyberspace in Zimbabwe?\u201d In that regard, the contextual nature of the problem that this research \nseeks to solve can only be addressed from an Interpretivist position. In this research, an \nInterpretivist or Constructivist paradigm was used.

This paper presents a comparison between the cybercrime laws in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and United Arab Emirates (UAE) based on the criteria of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (CoE Convention). There are many vulnerabilities in Saudi's cybercrime laws that need to improve and upgraded in line with the new solutions and threats according to international standards.

In designing the TOR, he sought to combine the cyber threat intelligence needs of Standard Chartered Bank and other financial institutions with the research that scholars of cyber conflict are conducting to understand the implications of the United States Department of Defense\u2019s cyber strategy of persistent engagement and forward defense.\n\nA team of nine postgraduates worked together throughout the Spring 2020 semester to conduct the research needed to satisfy the TOR. Eight of the nine are students of international security policy, and the remaining student international finance and economic policy. All have taken courses on cyber threat intelligence and cyber conflict.

Since 1999 I have been working to promote public and government agencies awareness to a new threat of these times: The Cyber Terrorism and all its flavors manifested today in our cybernetic-machine-dominated economical, political, social and private life.\r\nI have lectured in many occasions about this subject in important organizations, and in 2003 I wrote one of the first books written in this subject called Cyberterrorism, ISBN 980-07-8518-3.\r\n\r\nMost important for these pages is to get the message across and make the public conscious about this danger (CYBER TERRORISM) that will affect us all. This danger will not be eliminated until strong legislation is put in place, respected and enforced. Some 80% of the computing systems we use dally, especially based on early version of the Windows programs*, and other very vulnerable software will have to be reformed and security systems reinforced. Many users have already ditched Windows in favor of Mac, Google OS/Chrome, or Linux as they want to remain productive for longer period of time, virus and Cyber Fraud free. BUT THEY ALL (OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS & SMART PHONES) HAVE UNPATCHED VULNERABILITIES. THEY ALL HAVE! The Cloud Computing will not solve all our problems, as many of the MS systems and early code scripts have been inherited into the cloud.\r\n\r\nTerrorism is a tactic, at many levels and in many forms. Every day we register new attacks, by the thousand and the tens of thousands, under different forms of cyber terrorism, cyber crime, cyber fraud, cyber sabotage and economical espionage. The list of targets and points of origin is too long to be listed.\r\nUnder the veneer of the good things that internet brings to us all, there are negative and evil forces at work, all the time.\r\nWithout any doubt, we have to be conscious that an electromagnetic pulse attack will put all the IT systems on an industrial country out of work for some time, and can be used as a pre-emtive attack.\r\n\r\nWe are a decade after 9/11 and the main discussion is still centered on individual liberties, the Bill of Rights and the need for more security and how both will work together and influence each other. We don\u2019t have to sacrifice liberty for security but counter-terrorism activities are here to stay!\r\n\r\nTHIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. We are currently revising and updating the English version of this book with Gail Tenzer as the translator of the original 2003 published Spanish book. \r\nWe would like to present you the book, and have your brief opinion about this very important, clear and present danger asymmetric war, represented by cyber terrorism.\r\n\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49915448, "asset_id": 1236657, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1973776, "first_name": "HEDI", "last_name": "ENGHELBERG", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HEDIENGHELBERG", "display_name": "HEDI ENGHELBERG", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HEDIENGHELBERG?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1973776/756489/940455/s65_hedi.enghelberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 982, "name": "Cyberlaw", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberlaw?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1164, "name": "Democracy and Cyber-Democracy Theory and Practice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democracy_and_Cyber-Democracy_Theory_and_Practice?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1580, "name": "Cyberpsychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberpsychology?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 3723, "name": "History of Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Science?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 11336, "name": "Cyber Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Terrorism?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 11337, "name": "Cyber Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Warfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 12756, "name": "Cyberbullying", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberbullying?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 20594, "name": "Cyber crime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_crime?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 49062, "name": "Cibercultura", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cibercultura?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 65430, "name": "Cyber Physical Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Physical_Systems?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 285125, "name": "Cyber Crimes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Crimes?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 518821, "name": "Ciberdemocracia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ciberdemocracia?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 575199, "name": "Delincuencia Cibern\u00e9tica", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Delincuencia_Cibernetica?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1002107, "name": "CYBER FRAUD", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/CYBER_FRAUD?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1002111, "name": "CYBER CONTROL", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/CYBER_CONTROL?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1002114, "name": "CYBER ESPIONAGE", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/CYBER_ESPIONAGE?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1002115, "name": "CYBER TERRORISM AS AN ASYMETRY AND PRECISION DELIVERY WEAPON", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/CYBER_TERRORISM_AS_AN_ASYMETRY_AND_PRECISION_DELIVERY_WEAPON?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1002117, "name": "THE EVOLUTION OF CYBERTERRORISM", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/THE_EVOLUTION_OF_CYBERTERRORISM?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1002118, "name": "CYBER TERRORISM MARKETING", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/CYBER_TERRORISM_MARKETING?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1222790, "name": "Cyber Crime and Technological Advancements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Crime_and_Technological_Advancements?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 35532033, "title": "Virtual Theory Integrating Cybersecurity into International Relations Theory", "created_at": "2017-12-28T19:34:03.466-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35532033/Virtual_Theory_Integrating_Cybersecurity_into_International_Relations_Theory?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_35532033", "summary": "Existing theories of international relations (IR) have so far been unable to deal with the challenges presented by emerging forms of cyberattack.

In this article, we first examine AVs and different categories of the technological risks associated with them. We then explore strategies that can be adopted to address these risks, and explore emerging responses by governments for addressing AV risks. Our analyses reveal that, thus far, governments have in most instances avoided stringent measures in order to promote AV developments and the majority of responses are non-binding and focus on creating councils or working groups to better explore AV implications. The US has been active in introducing legislations to address issues related to privacy and cybersecurity. The UK and Germany, in particular, have enacted laws to address liability issues; other countries mostly acknowledge these issues, but have yet to implement specific strategies. To address privacy and cybersecurity risks strategies ranging from introduction or amendment of non-AV specific legislation to creating working groups have been adopted. Much less attention has been paid to issues such as environmental and employment risks, although a few governments have begun programmes to retrain workers who might be negatively affected.",

The Pragmatism paradigm is elaborately associated with the Mixed Method Research (MMR), and is the research philosophy used in this research. Pragmatism recognizes the full rationale of the congruence between knowledge and action. The Pragmatic paradigm advocates a relational epistemology, a non-singular reality ontology, a mixed methods methodology, and a value-laden axiology. A qualitative approach where Focus Group discussions were held was used. The Artificial Intelligence paradigms evaluated include machine learning methods, autonomous robotic vehicle, artificial neural networks, and fuzzy logic.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63502056, "asset_id": 43232839, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4091897, "first_name": "Professor Gabriel", "last_name": "Kabanda", "domain_name": "uz-ac", "page_name": "ProfessorGabrielKabanda", "display_name": "Professor Gabriel Kabanda", "profile_url": "https://uz-ac.academia.edu/ProfessorGabrielKabanda?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4091897/1576430/42370481/s65_professor_gabriel.kabanda.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2008, "name": "Machine Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Machine_Learning?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 158601, "name": "Aritificial Intelligence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aritificial_Intelligence?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2531760, "name": "Science of Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_of_Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2531763, "name": "Cybersecurity Dynamics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity_Dynamics?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 78940502, "title": "AI/ML in Security Orchestration, Automation and Response: Future Research Directions", "created_at": "2022-05-10T12:22:59.141-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/78940502/AI_ML_in_Security_Orchestration_Automation_and_Response_Future_Research_Directions?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_78940502", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 85823504, "asset_id": 78940502, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 189655640, "first_name": "Lawrence", "last_name": "Awuah", "domain_name": "csuglobal", "page_name": "LawrenceAwuah", "display_name": "Lawrence J Awuah", "profile_url": "https://csuglobal.academia.edu/LawrenceAwuah?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/189655640/52886223/43445600/s65_lawrence.awuah.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 237, "name": "Cognitive Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cognitive_Science?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10005, "name": "Applications of Machine Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applications_of_Machine_Learning?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 144423, "name": "Orchestration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Orchestration?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1241236, "name": "Software Defined Networks (SDN)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Software_Defined_Networks_SDN_?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1450126, "name": "Blockchains", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Blockchains?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1455459, "name": "Deeper Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deeper_Learning?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2532663, "name": "Deep Reinforcement Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deep_Reinforcement_Learning?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2553162, "name": "IoT Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/IoT_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 3363490, "name": "federated learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/federated_learning?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 31827545, "title": "S\u0130BER G\u00dcVENL\u0130K VE S\u0130BER SALDIRI T\u00dcRLER\u0130 CYBER SECURITY AND CYBER ATTACK TYPES\n03/05/2016", "created_at": "2017-03-12T04:25:14.381-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31827545/S%C4%B0BER_G%C3%9CVENL%C4%B0K_VE_S%C4%B0BER_SALDIRI_T%C3%9CRLER%C4%B0_CYBER_SECURITY_AND_CYBER_ATTACK_TYPES_03_05_2016?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_31827545", "summary": "\u00d6zet: Dijital d\u00fcnya olarak adland\u0131r\u0131lan g\u00fcn\u00fcm\u00fcz d\u00fcnyas\u0131nda, art\u0131k insano\u011flu teknolojiksiz bir hayat\u0131 d\u00fc\u015f\u00fcnememektedir. \u0130nsan, \u00e7o\u011funlukla ge\u00e7mi\u015fine ya da al\u0131\u015fkanl\u0131klar\u0131na s\u0131k\u0131 s\u0131k\u0131ya ba\u011fl\u0131 oldu\u011fu i\u00e7in yeni fikirleri ve \u00f6nemli icatlar\u0131 benimsemede tutucu davrand\u0131\u011f\u0131 halde teknolojik alan\u0131ndaki de\u011fi\u015fikliklere ani ve h\u0131zl\u0131 tepkiler verip benimsemi\u015ftir.

Abstract: In today's world, which is called the digital world, human beings can not think of a technological life anymore. Because human beings are strictly tied to their past or habits, human beings have suddenly and quickly reacted to changes in the technological field as they embraced new ideas and important inventions. Since crimes committed through computers are increasing in the world and negatively affecting public life, ways of fighting these crimes have begun to be sought. This study consists of three main parts. In the first part, the concept of cybercrime will be examined.

The complexity and dynamics of cyber attacks require protecting mechanisms to be responsive, adaptive, and large-scale. Machine learning, or more specifically deep reinforcement learning (DRL), methods have been proposed widely to address these issues. By incorporating deep learning into traditional RL, DRL is highly capable of solving complex, dynamic, and especially high-dimensional cyber defense problems. This paper presents a survey of DRL approaches developed for cyber security. We touch on different vital aspects , including DRL-based security methods for cyber-physical systems, autonomous intrusion detection techniques, and multi-agent DRL-based game theory simulations for defense strategies against cyber attacks. Extensive discussions and future research directions on DRL-based cyber security are also given. We expect that this comprehensive review provides the foundations for and facilitates future studies on exploring the potential of emerging DRL to cope with increasingly complex cyber security

It will examine three specific areas where multi-sector collaborations are underway and have experienced some success: (1) protecting privacy, cyberspace, and critical infrastructure with the private sector through formal information sharing mechanisms; (2) combating threats to the international banking system, such as terrorist financing, money laundering, and cybercrime, in partnership with the financial services sector; and (3) countering violent extremism and foreign fighter recruitment by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) with local communities and civil society organizations in the United States. These examples illustrate the challenging nature of these security threats and the importance of harnessing resources across various sectors to counter them. Since the government no longer enjoys a monopoly on national security or the use of force as it did in the past, it must adopt a \u201cwhole of society\u201d approach to understand and address the evolving threats to our security and prosperity in this globalized world. In the 21st century, all sectors need to communicate, cooperate, and collaborate (C\u00b3) through public-private partnerships (P\u00b3) to counter the convergence of illicit networks and ensure national security.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50291604, "asset_id": 29823229, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35124773, "first_name": "Celina", "last_name": "Realuyo", "domain_name": "ndu", "page_name": "CelinaRealuyo", "display_name": "Celina  Realuyo", "profile_url": "https://ndu.academia.edu/CelinaRealuyo?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/35124773/11524052/12852859/s65_celina.realuyo.jpg"}, {"id": 322983, "first_name": "Doowan", "last_name": "Lee", "domain_name": "usfca", "page_name": "DoowanLee", "display_name": "Doowan Lee", "profile_url": "https://usfca.academia.edu/DoowanLee?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/322983/135166/14960771/s65_doowan.lee.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 15124, "name": "Convergence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convergence?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 67521, "name": "Public Private Partnership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Private_Partnership?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 191169, "name": "Anti money laundering and Terrorist Financing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anti_money_laundering_and_Terrorist_Financing?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 226998, "name": "Crime-Terror Nexus", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Crime-Terror_Nexus?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 253944, "name": "Terrorism and Homeland Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Terrorism_and_Homeland_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 461890, "name": "Countering Violent Extremism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Countering_Violent_Extremism?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 761870, "name": "Terrorism and Counterterrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Terrorism_and_Counterterrorism?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 32054172, "title": "Protecting Internet Traffic: Security Challenges And Solutions.

While most, if not all of the following guidelines apply to all Internet-connected devices, the presented guidelines focus on internet traffic security best practices for wired or wireless networks. They detail security mechanisms necessary for consideration at the manufacturing design phase rather than after deployment of devices to internet service providers and end users. The paper leads with the assertion that a thorough study on protecting Internet traffic does not yet exist, and proposes, based on our findings, that existing technology is not yet sufficient to meet the goal of protecting Internet traffic. The best practices presented are centered around countering and preventing malicious activity. By setting up a secure network with industry standard security protocols, the risk and potential legal liabilities associated with an unsecured network can be proactively addressed.",

"summary": "Cyber attacks by domestic and foreign threat actors are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cyber adversaries exploit a cybersecurity skill/knowledge gap and an open society, undermining the information security/privacy of citizens and businesses and eroding trust in governments, thus threatening social and political stability. The use of open digital hacking technologies in ethical hacking in higher education and within broader society raises ethical, technical, social, and political challenges for liberal democracies. Programs teaching ethical hacking in higher education are steadily growing but there is a concern that teaching students hacking skills increases crime risk to society by drawing students toward criminal acts. A cybersecurity skill gap undermines the security/viability of business and government institutions. The thesis presents an examination of opportunities and risks involved in using AI powered intelligence gathering/surveillance technologies in ethical hacking teaching practices in Canada. Taking a qualitative exploratory case study approach, technoethical inquiry theory (Bunge-Luppicini) and Weick\u2019s sensemaking model were applied as a sociotechnical theory (STEI-KW) to explore ethical hacking teaching practices in two Canadian universities. In-depth interviews with ethical hacking university experts, industry practitioners, and policy experts, and a document review were conducted. Findings pointed to a skill/knowledge gap in ethical hacking literature regarding the meanings, ethics, values, skills/knowledge, roles and responsibilities, and practices of ethical hacking and ethical hackers which underlies an identity and legitimacy crisis for professional ethical hacking practitioners; and a Teaching vs Practice cybersecurity skill gap in ethical hacking curricula. Two main S&T innovation risk mitigation initiatives were explored: An OSINT Analyst cybersecurity role and associated body of knowledge foundation framework as an interdisciplinary research area, and a networked centre of excellence of ethical hacking communities of practice as a knowledge management and governance/policy innovation approach focusing on the systematization and standardization of an ethical hacking body of knowledge.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62995254, "asset_id": 42771538, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 16951881, "first_name": "Baha", "last_name": "Abu-Shaqra", "domain_name": "uottawa", "page_name": "BahaAbushaqra", "display_name": "Baha Abu-Shaqra", "profile_url": "https://uottawa.academia.edu/BahaAbushaqra?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2621, "name": "Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Higher_Education?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9770, "name": "Technology Assessment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Technology_Assessment?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14533, "name": "In-depth Interviews", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/In-depth_Interviews?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 31573, "name": "Technoethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Technoethics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 50680, "name": "Sensemaking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sensemaking?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 54424, "name": "science and technology studies (STS)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/science_and_technology_studies_STS_?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 56050, "name": "Ethical Hacking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethical_Hacking?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 202114, "name": "Sociotechnology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociotechnology?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 514388, "name": "Mario Bunge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mario_Bunge?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 593728, "name": "Karl E.

The first part concentrates on a number of historical and theoretical or conceptual approaches to Internet Governance. The second part has a strong focus on contemporary debates concerning selected issues of the field.\n\nThe historical and theoretical contributions are initiated by a discussion regarding the Global South as a region, its historical formation in the context of decolonization, the debates on the New International Economic Order (NIEO), the New International Information and Communication Order (NIICO), and the political turn to a neoliberal agenda in which Internet Governance was developed (Oppermann). The challenges of Southern countries to participate politically and economically in this environment are then addressed and contextualized through different theoretical frameworks including International Political Economy and global International Relations, combined with a discussion on strategies and ambitions of countries in the Global South to advance their own insertion in Internet Governance (Chenou, Rojas Fuerte). Internet Governance itself as a concept from a historical perspective, including processes of institutionalization, is then addressed by Canabarro, together with a discussion of the NetMundial meeting in Brazil as a consequence of the Snowden revelations and the NSA affair. The extensive global surveillance of Internet users including governments and other organizations by the USA and some of their allies in other parts of the world increased the debates on online privacy and also on topics including power, influence and global constellations that brought questions about new forms of colonialism on the agenda. Colonization in the digital age is a topic of growing importance, especially but not only in the South, and so is the discussion on decolonization. Emanating from the debate on decolonial computing, Ali is addressing Internet Governance and the need for its decolonization. He does so by critically analyzing the North-centric discourse of Internet Governance, thus bringing a new perspective to the debates. He is then followed by Gonzales, who develops a theoretical debate on ideology, the information revolution and its impacts on and correlations with a number of manifestations that occurred in several countries in the year 2011, including Egypt, Tunisia, and others.\n\nThe debates on historical and theoretical approaches are then followed by contributions on contemporary Internet Governance issues in the Global South. This part is initiated by two chapters discussing economic and political challenges related to the Domain Name System in Southern countries. While White is discussing generic top level domains and ICANN\u2019s new gTLD program in the Global South, Aguerre is focussing on the ccTLD environment in the South, in particular in Latin America. They are followed by a chapter on South Africa\u2019s policy framework on ICT and Internet Governance, mostly represented by the 2016 ICT White Paper, which in combination with the 2015 draft cybersecurity bill forms the current foundation for many Internet Governance debates in the country. In this context, the three authors (Darch, Adams, and Yu) also reflect on the questions of governmental control, multilateralism, and multistakeholderism as forms of governance and participation. The following chapter picks up the topic of participation in Internet Governance processes, albeit from a different perspective. Lobato addresses the problem of regional inequality within countries, pointing out the situation of less connected rural areas in Amazonia, in the North of Brazil. She discusses central aspects like infrastructure, access costs, and digital illiteracy and also presents possible solutions for regional integration like access programs and major national events in the regions like the Brazilian Internet Forum which took place in the North of the country in 2013. How lower national access rates are no obstacle for putting the Internet on the national political and security agenda is then clarified by Workneh and the case of Ethiopia. With a national Internet access rate of about 15% and confronted with infrastructural challenges to increase this number, the country is currently following an Internet securitization debate in the context of a dispute over political opposition that often falls under the label of \u201cterrorism\u201d. In this chapter, Workneh discusses how the Northern discourse on a so-called \u201cglobal war on terrorism\u201d impacts the right to freedom of speech online in Ethiopia and how it increases concerns over online participation and privacy rights. Privacy and participation are also addressed in the concluding chapter of this publication developed by Kemer. She discusses privacy rights in the context of International Law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, followed by an analysis of the standpoints of the Brazilian government under Dilma Rousseff on privacy and online participation after the NSA surveillance activities were revealed.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58209780, "asset_id": 38174294, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25374, "first_name": "Daniel", "last_name": "Oppermann", "domain_name": "uff", "page_name": "DanielOppermann", "display_name": "Daniel Oppermann", "profile_url": "https://uff.academia.edu/DanielOppermann?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/25374/8217/2857964/s65_daniel.oppermann.jpg"}, {"id": 512202, "first_name": "Syed Mustafa", "last_name": "Ali", "domain_name": "open", "page_name": "SyedAli", "display_name": "Syed Mustafa Ali", "profile_url": "https://open.academia.edu/SyedAli?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/512202/178561/18700701/s65_syed.ali.jpg"}, {"id": 5523480, "first_name": "Alexandre", "last_name": "Arns Gonzales", "domain_name": "unb", "page_name": "AlexandreArnsGonzales", "display_name": "Alexandre  Arns Gonzales", "profile_url": "https://unb.academia.edu/AlexandreArnsGonzales?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5523480/2846614/35363059/s65_alexandre.arns_gonzales.jpeg"}, {"id": 156530, "first_name": "Carolina", "last_name": "Aguerre", "domain_name": "udesa", "page_name": "CarolinaAguerre", "display_name": "Carolina Aguerre", "profile_url": "https://udesa.academia.edu/CarolinaAguerre?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/156530/41459370/33596103/s65_carolina.aguerre.jpg"}, {"id": 2843530, "first_name": "Thaise", "last_name": "Kemer", "domain_name": "usp-br", "page_name": "ThaiseKemer", "display_name": "Thaise Kemer", "profile_url": "https://usp-br.academia.edu/ThaiseKemer?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2843530/933349/1168734/s65_thaise.kemer.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 982, "name": "Cyberlaw", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberlaw?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1759, "name": "Internet Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_Studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2511, "name": "Cybercrimes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrimes?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5040, "name": "South African Politics and Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_African_Politics_and_Society?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7074, "name": "Internet Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 7822, "name": "Internet Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_Governance?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 10227, "name": "Amazonia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amazonia?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 15732, "name": "New ICANN Top Level Domains", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_ICANN_Top_Level_Domains?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 16416, "name": "Internet & Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_and_Society?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 21361, "name": "Ethiopia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethiopia?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 38429, "name": "Global South", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_South?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 54528, "name": "Inclus\u00e3o digital", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Inclusao_digital?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 56989, "name": "Latin America", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_America?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 70266, "name": "Brazilian Foreign policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brazilian_Foreign_policy?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 77281, "name": "Decolonization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonization?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 95854, "name": "Critical Terrorism Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Terrorism_Studies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 241170, "name": "Bandung", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bandung?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 366964, "name": "Non-Aligned Movement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Non-Aligned_Movement?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 389563, "name": "ICANN", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ICANN?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 37779506, "title": "INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S RESPONSE TO THE RISE OF CYBERCRIME.docx", "created_at": "2018-11-15T05:05:09.226-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37779506/INTERNATIONAL_COMMUNITYS_RESPONSE_TO_THE_RISE_OF_CYBERCRIME_docx?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_37779506", "summary": "This paper examines how the International Community has attempted to address cybercriminal activity. It shows how the Information Revolution has established an environment within which cybercrime has been allowed to flourish. It highlights how, globally, an abundance of opportunities and targets, motivated offenders and an absence of effective deterrence or defenders, has driven cybercrime to its current scale - estimated to extract close to 1% of global GDP. With the context for cybercriminal activity established, eight significant international instruments are examined to investigate how the International Community has reacted to the transnational issue of cybercrime \u2013 with an assessment provided on their strengths and weaknesses. These include: the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the Group of Eight, the International Telecommunications Union, the Council of Europe, the European Union, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the League of Arab States, and the African Union. Through analysis of these eight instruments, an appraisal is made of the effectiveness of international action undertaken. This dissertation concludes that, despite some commendable efforts seen in regional organisations, the International Community has failed to address the underlying drivers of cybercrime.

Alongside these challenges, the number of threats is rising exponentially due to the attack surface increasing through numerous interfaces offered for each service. To alleviate the impact of these threats, researchers have proposed numerous solutions; however, current tools often fail to adapt to ever-changing architectures, associated threats and 0-days. This manuscript aims to provide researchers with a taxonomy and survey of current dataset composition and current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) capabilities and assets. These taxonomies and surveys aim to improve both the efficiency of IDS and the creation of datasets to build the next generation IDS as well as to reflect networks threats more accurately in future datasets. To this end, this manuscript also provides a taxonomy and survey or network threats and associated tools. The manuscript highlights that current IDS only cover 25% of our threat taxonomy, while current datasets demonstrate clear lack of real-network threats and attack representation, but rather include a large number of deprecated threats, hence limiting the accuracy of current machine learning IDS. Moreover, the taxonomies are open-sourced to allow public contributions through a Github repository.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56781745, "asset_id": 36829837, "asset_type": "Work",

With the ascendance of cyberspace as an important domain of daily activity, international politics has already experienced technology-driven change. Big Data unveils new dimensions to these changes, which we as political scientists and observers of international affairs are only now beginning to comprehend. It changes power distributions and thereby some basic assumptions of international relations theory, and its analytics will increasingly inform international-relations research and policymaking. It has created both new opportunities and threats in areas such as humanitarian aid, development, and international peace and security. As hardware becomes better and cheaper, and as open-source software and database search and analysis services become more widely available, the power of Big Data is also increasingly at the disposal of small enterprises and individuals.

devices will be digital and automated. In an article in 2016, Amy Nordum predicted that around \u201825-30 billion devices will be connected to the internet by 2020\u2019, from driverless cars and industrial control systems connected to home automation and health monitor- ing devices. While increasing use of automated technologies, big data, the Cloud, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) in many areas of business and society, have made life easy, at the same time, a whole new set of challenges related to cyberspace such as data privacy, security, storage, and online crimes has also emerged. Dealing with these challenges is a mammoth task and a serious concern since such advancements in the field of technology have also given rise to competition in cyberspace between nations where proxy actors and organisations have surfaced to fulfil their political agendas and ideological objectives (Hundley 1996). In Pakistan, cyber security is still a relatively low priority on the national agenda. It, hence, remains bleak and compromised due to lack of digital security measures in Information Technology (IT) infrastructure. The government, public and private sector have increasingly become vulnerable to new and malicious cyber threats. This chapter will discuss cyber threats to the digital sectors of Pakistan such as banking, telecommunication, energy and power, along with existing preparedness and degree of cyber security maturity adopted by the government. The chapter will also provide policy recommendations to the government and the military for improving the country\u2019s existing cyber security framework.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66241886, "asset_id": 46613739, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 44919138, "first_name": "Zaheema", "last_name": "Iqbal", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ZaheemaIqbal", "display_name": "Zaheema  Iqbal", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ZaheemaIqbal?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/44919138/11927616/13291116/s65_zaheema.iqbal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11336, "name": "Cyber Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Terrorism?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 113058, "name": "Data Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_Governance?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1611696, "name": "Big Data Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Big_Data_Governance?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2207442, "name": "Cyberspace Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace_Governance?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 19908459, "title": "Israel and Cyberspace: Unique Threat and Response", "created_at": "2015-12-30T07:13:26.856-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19908459/Israel_and_Cyberspace_Unique_Threat_and_Response?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_19908459", "summary": "This article provides insights into the dangers and opportunities that the cyber realm poses to states by conducting the first comprehensive case study on Israeli use of cyberspace.

Motivated by this significance, we introduce a level-based approach for achieving attribution. In our proposed approach, attribution consists of three steps: (1) identification of the cyberweapon used; (2) determination of the origin of the attack; and (3) identification of the actual attacker. We conduct an in-depth analysis of recently proposed attribution techniques. Our analysis reveals that indirect methods of attribution are particularly effective when attributing cybercrimes; many of them remain unattributed. We also discuss some of the legal issues pertaining to attribution, and we argue that well-defined international laws for cyberspace along with strong cooperation among governments are needed to track down and punish cybercriminals.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46589393, "asset_id": 26275828, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4089543, "first_name": "Jawwad", "last_name": "Shamsi", "domain_name": "nu", "page_name": "JawwadShamsi", "display_name": "Jawwad  Shamsi", "profile_url": "https://nu.academia.edu/JawwadShamsi?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4089543/6459946/7306391/s65_jawwad.shamsi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 982, "name": "Cyberlaw", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberlaw?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2511, "name": "Cybercrimes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrimes?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3703, "name": "Network Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Network_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41005, "name": "Malware Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malware_Analysis?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 50154, "name": "Malware", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malware?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 162267, "name": "Malware Classification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malware_Classification?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 406480, "name": "Malware Reverse Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malware_Reverse_Engineering?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 41492141, "title": "Dilemas del ciberespacio.

Applying comparative law, we proceed to assess whether and how different legal frameworks and traditions \u2013 such as civil law, common law, sharia law and socialist/communist law \u2013 affect judicial cooperation between territories and regional institutions. A distinction between the first-and second-generation institutions is also made, with the conclusion that the latter (as organizations focused on trade and economic issues) drive judicial cooperation

Thus, detecting various cyber-attacks or anomalies in a network and building an effective intrusion detection system that performs an essential role in today's security is becoming more important. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning techniques, can be used for building such a data-driven intelligent intrusion detection system. In order to achieve this goal, in this paper, we present an Intrusion Detection Tree (\"IntruDTree\") machine-learning-based security model that first takes into account the ranking of security features according to their importance and then build a tree-based generalized intrusion detection model based on the selected important features. This model is not only effective in terms of prediction accuracy for unseen test cases but also minimizes the computational complexity of the model by reducing the feature dimensions.

It will focus on the anarchic nature of the cyberspace, its relevance with international relations and the philosophy of international law. It also questions the validity and possibility of traditional state-centric international human rights law for protection of human rights in the cyber domain. Furthermore, it questions whether cyberspace made international relations much more complicated, anarchic and uncertain. Finally the work is going to develop policy proposals and necessary steps for protecting human rights more effectively through some national strategic action plans, regulations and initiatives.

The velocity of information has increased drastically with messages now spreading internationally within seconds online. Readers are overwhelmed by the flood of information, but older markers of veracity have not kept up, nor has there been a commensurate growth in the ability to counter false or fake news. These developments have given an opportunity to those seeking to destabilize a state or to push their perspectives to the fore. This report discusses fake news with regard to the ways that it may manifest, how its dissemination is enabled through social media and search engines, how people are cognitively predisposed to imbibing it, and what are the various responses internationally that have been implemented or are being considered to counter it. This report finds that efforts to counter fake news must comprise both legislative and non-legislative approaches as each has its own challenges. First, the approaches must factor in an understanding of how technology enables fake news to spread and how people are predisposed to believing it. Second, it would be helpful to make a distinction between the different categories of falsehoods that are being propagated using fake news as the medium. Third, efforts should go hand in hand with ongoing programmes at shoring up social resilience and national consensus. Fourth, efforts need to move beyond bland rebuttal and statements, as these may be counter-productive. Fifth, counter-narratives that challenge fake news must be released expeditiously as fake news is able to spread en masse at great speed due to technology. In sum, collaboration across the whole of society, including good public-private partnership, is necessary in order to unravel fake news and ensure better synergy of efforts in countering it.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56721006, "asset_id": 36773437, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24294580, "first_name": "Benjamin", "last_name": "Ang", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "BenjaminAng", "display_name": "Benjamin Ang", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/BenjaminAng?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24294580/12090541/13468163/s65_benjamin.ang.jpg"}, {"id": 79374905, "first_name": "Norman", "last_name": "Vasu", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "NormanVasu", "display_name": "Norman Vasu", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/NormanVasu?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3356, "name": "Propaganda", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Propaganda?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4810, "name": "Information Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Warfare?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8280, "name": "Media Literacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Literacy?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18086, "name": "Information operations (IO)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_operations_IO_?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 61620, "name": "National Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 521329, "name": "Information and Media Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_and_Media_Warfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 831496, "name": "Cybersecurity policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity_policy?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 980529, "name": "Fake News", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fake_News?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1328172, "name": "Hybrid Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybrid_Warfare?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 36512939, "title": "Autonomous Vehicles for Smart and Sustainable Cities: An In-Depth Exploration of Privacy and Cybersecurity Implications", "created_at": "2018-04-26T23:15:36.436-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36512939/Autonomous_Vehicles_for_Smart_and_Sustainable_Cities_An_In_Depth_Exploration_of_Privacy_and_Cybersecurity_Implications?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_36512939", "summary": "Amidst rapid urban development, sustainable transportation solutions are required to meet the increasing demands for mobility whilst mitigating the potentially negative social, economic, and environmental impacts.

Lastly, we review the efforts taken by the \u200bfederal government in the US, the UK, China, Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Germany, France, and the EU, and by US state governments to address AV-related privacy and cybersecurity risks in-depth. Overall, the actions taken by governments to address privacy risks are mainly in the form of regulations or voluntary guidelines. To address cybersecurity risks, governments have mostly resorted to regulations that are not specific to AVs and are conducting research and fostering research collaborations with the private sector.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56432983, "asset_id": 36512939, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81138119, "first_name": "Hazel",

By examining a sample of publicly available APT attribution reports for the time professional groups, require to complete the analysis, team size, and the average CTI analyst salary, this study estimates the average cost and time required per attribution. Private security organizations can use this metric in combination with an understanding of the benefits and pitfalls of attribution to determine if the organization should establish an internal attribution program.

This is witnessed in the high volume of cyber-attacks currently populating the cyberspace.  Though several approaches have been proposed and deployed in recent times, most of them are only theoretical masterpieces while others remain computationally infeasible due to the computational requirements for implementing them.  Where implementation is possible, the issue of computational complexity becomes a significant overhead in which case a large amount of computing resources such as CPU cycle, memory, network bandwidth and data structures are consumed culminating in tedious, time consuming, and error prone processes.  Similarly, most of these techniques are basically reactive and as such can only be triggered when an incident is reported while most depend on the administrator to apply the necessary mitigation processes after an attack has occurred.  To this effect, this paper presents a survey of cyber security approaches that have been proposed in the Literature.

However, building an appropriate DL model is a challenging task, due to the dynamic nature and variations in real-world problems and data. Moreover, the lack of core understanding turns DL methods into black-box machines that hamper development at the standard level. This article presents a structured and comprehensive view on DL techniques including a taxonomy considering various types of real-world tasks like supervised or unsupervised. In our taxonomy, we take into account deep networks for supervised or discriminative learning, unsupervised or generative learning as well as hybrid learning and relevant others. We also summarize real-world application areas where deep learning techniques can be used. Finally, we point out ten potential aspects for future generation DL modeling with research directions.

Security researchers and industry practitioners have proposed security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) solutions designed to integrate and automate the disparate security tasks, processes, and applications in response to security incidents to empower SOC teams. The next big step for cyber threat detection, mitigation, and prevention efforts is to leverage AI/ML in SOAR solutions. AI/ML will act as a force multiplier empowering SOC analysts even further. We conducted a detailed survey by studying work by both security researchers and industry practitioners on SOAR, including its interpretations, from an AI/ML perspective by reviewing works published in academic journals, conferences, websites, blogs, white papers, etc. (a multi-vocal view).

In conjunction with an in-depth literature review, we led multiple discussions on cybersecurity with a diverse group of practitioners, academics, and graduate students to examine multiple perspectives of what should be included in a definition of cybersecurity. In this article, we propose a resulting new definition: \"Cybersecurity is the organization and collection of resources, processes, and structures used to protect cyberspace and cyberspace-enabled systems from occurrences that misalign de jure from de facto property rights.\" Articulating a concise, inclusive, meaningful, and unifying definition will enable an enhanced and enriched focus on interdisciplinary cybersecurity dialectics and thereby will influence the approaches of academia, industry, and government and non-governmental organizations to cybersecurity challenges.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35363701, "asset_id": 9061472, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 78860032, "first_name": "Randy", "last_name": "Purse", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RandyPurse", "display_name": "Randy Purse", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RandyPurse?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/78860032/23584630/22629492/s65_randy.purse.jpg"}, {"id": 16868688, "first_name": "Nadia", "last_name": "Diakun-Thibault", "domain_name": "ncsu", "page_name": "NadiaDiakun", "display_name": "Nadia Diakun-Thibault", "profile_url": "https://ncsu.academia.edu/NadiaDiakun?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/16868688/4628975/5348430/s65_nadia.diakun.jpg"}, {"id": 78582981, "first_name": "Dan", "last_name": "Craigen", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DanCraigen", "display_name": "Dan Craigen", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DanCraigen?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 41674450, "title": "Cyber-Security Internals of a Skoda Octavia vRS: A Hands on Approach", "created_at": "2020-01-19T10:14:11.290-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41674450/Cyber_Security_Internals_of_a_Skoda_Octavia_vRS_A_Hands_on_Approach?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_41674450", "summary": "The convergence of information technology and vehicular technologies are a growing paradigm, allowing information to be sent by and to vehicles. This information can further be processed by the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) and the Controller Area Network (CAN) for in-vehicle communications or through a mobile phone or server for out-vehicle communication. Information sent by or to the vehicle can be life-critical (e.g. breaking, acceleration, cruise control, emergency communication, etc.. .). As vehicular technology advances, in-vehicle networks are connected to external networks through 3 and 4G mobile networks, enabling manufacturer and customer monitoring of different aspects of the car. While these services provide valuable information, they also increase the attack surface of the vehicle, and can enable long and short range attacks. In this manuscript, we evaluate the security of the 2017 Skoda Octavia vRS 4x4. Both physical and remote attacks are considered, the key fob rolling code is successfully compromised, privacy attacks are demonstrated through the infotainment system, the Volkswagen Transport Protocol 2.0 is reverse engineered. Additionally, in-car attacks are highlighted and described, providing an overlook of potentially deadly threats by modifying ECU parameters and components enabling digital forensics investigation are identified.

In conclusion, it is established that the biggest difference between cyber-security and other private security topics is that the state is not giving away power and authority to private actors in traditional security matters but that the state is increasingly enforcing its authority in cyberspace, which has been almost exclusively dominated and shaped by private actors", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49204691, "asset_id": 19338408, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 350006, "first_name": "Myriam", "last_name": "Dunn Cavelty", "domain_name": "ethz", "page_name": "MyriamCavelty", "display_name": "Myriam Dunn Cavelty", "profile_url": "https://ethz.academia.edu/MyriamCavelty?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/350006/94486/302631/s65_myriam.dunn_cavelty.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3705, "name": "International Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5523, "name": "Security Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_Studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5535, "name": "Critical Security Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Security_Studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20594, "name": "Cyber crime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_crime?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46332, "name": "Public Private Partnerships", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Private_Partnerships?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 256985, "name": "Private Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Private_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 520696, "name": "Mercenaries and Private Military Contractors", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mercenaries_and_Private_Military_Contractors?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 7714599, "title": "IIS Security and Programming Countermeasures", "created_at": "2014-07-19T06:37:26.466-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7714599/IIS_Security_and_Programming_Countermeasures?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_7714599", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34241123, "asset_id": 7714599, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14110281, "first_name": "Jason", "last_name": "Coombs", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JasonCoombs", "display_name": "Jason Coombs", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JasonCoombs?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14110281/3882466/4540631/s65_jason.coombs.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 449, "name": "Software Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Software_Engineering?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 984, "name": "Web 2.0", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Web_2.0?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1380, "name": "Computer Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Engineering?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8130, "name": "Web Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Web_Development?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 9246, "name": "Social Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 26860, "name": "Cloud Computing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cloud_Computing?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 30947, "name": "The Internet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Internet?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 643885, "name": "Cyberforensics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberforensics?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 49967219, "title": "Internet Weapon or Tool?", "created_at": "2021-07-15T19:10:25.798-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49967219/Internet_Weapon_or_Tool?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_49967219", "summary": "This book introduces us to legal and technical aspects of the Internet.

"The global cybersecurity discourse has never proven more fragmented than in the aftermath of the failure of the last United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security. This discourse stands trapped in long-lasting and seemingly crystallized normative stances between \u201cthe West\u201d and \u201cthe East,\u201d yet it also calls upon the international community to regulate a wide spectrum of phenomena, ranging from thefts of digitally-stored trade secrets to large-scale pervasive attacks, which may soon reach the threshold of armed attacks. If one situates the major cybersecurity players on a sliding scale between freedom and control over cyber content and infrastructure, the mainstream stance would place the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Brazil, India, China, and Russia in that order. Nonetheless, this scale is in practice more complex, in part due to the influence of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a regional security forum which has witnessed major rebalancing after the membership expansion in June 2017. This paper scrutinizes India\u2019s contribution towards a possible fragmentation of the \u201cEastern\u201d cybersecurity discourse based on hard laws and state assertiveness, and the consequent disruption of the constructivist East-West binary dialectic about cyberwarfare, cyberterrorism, cyber espionage, and online data protection. By simultaneously negotiating its sub-alterity and rejecting its subalternity, India holds the potential to reshape an otherwise almost-coherent \u201ccyber East.\u201d", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59363624, "asset_id": 39232462, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 53768286, "first_name": "Riccardo", "last_name": "Vecellio Segate", "domain_name": "bristol", "page_name": "RiccardoVecellioSegate", "display_name": "Riccardo Vecellio Segate", "profile_url": "https://bristol.academia.edu/RiccardoVecellioSegate?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/53768286/14185984/66206933/s65_riccardo.vecellio_segate.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7074, "name": "Internet Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_Law?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7560, "name": "Public International Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_International_Law?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7669, "name": "Russian Foreign Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian_Foreign_Policy?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7822, "name": "Internet Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_Governance?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 10058, "name": "Cyberspace Regulation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace_Regulation?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 10370, "name": "East Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Asian_Politics?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 34292, "name": "Poststructuralist Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poststructuralist_Theory?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 38204, "name": "China's foreign policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinas_foreign_policy?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 41862, "name": "Cyberwarfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberwarfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 96546, "name": "Cyber Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 127385, "name": "Law and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_and_Technology?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 155966, "name": "Law and Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_and_Language?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 183140, "name": "ASEAN Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN_Studies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 467668, "name": "Cyberterrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberterrorism?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 965931, "name": "Shanghai Cooperation Organisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shanghai_Cooperation_Organisation?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1002114, "name": "CYBER ESPIONAGE", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/CYBER_ESPIONAGE?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2899136, "name": "Cyberattack", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberattack?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 33182863, "title": "MemoryMonRWX: Detect Kernel-Mode Rootkits via Real-Time Logging & Controlling Memory Access", "created_at": "2017-05-24T13:31:04.330-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33182863/MemoryMonRWX_Detect_Kernel_Mode_Rootkits_via_Real_Time_Logging_and_Controlling_Memory_Access?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_33182863", "summary": "Modern malware and spyware platforms attack existing antivirus solutions and even Microsoft PatchGuard.

We have checked this concept by developing MemoryMonRWX, which is a bare-metal hypervisor. MemoryMonRWX is able to track and trap all types of memory access: read, write, and execute. MemoryMonRWX also has the following competitive advantages: fine-grained analysis, support of multi-core CPUs and 64-bit Windows 10. MemoryMonRWX is able to protect critical kernel memory areas even when PatchGuard has been disabled by malware.

Around 300 state-sponsored cyber operations have been conducted since 2005. The future uncertainty of cyber-warfare has prompted calls for measures to regulate the actions of states in cyberspace. In this regard, cyber-peacekeeping has also emerged as a significant research area to distinctively deal with cyber component of future conflicts. Although, a number of challenges exist regarding materialization of full fledge cyber-peacekeeping force, it can be easily integrated into the current United Nations (UN) peacekeeping organizational structure. In legal terms, operationalization of cyber-peacekeeping 'force' will depend on the mandate of peace operations approved by the UN Security Council (UNSC). This paper discusses the challenges in the way of creating cyber-peacekeeping force and also offers recommendations by presenting a general framework regarding how such a force can be operationalized. Despite realizing the fact that a dedicated cyber-peacekeeping force seems a far sighted idea in present times but a distinct cyber unit can be certainly formed and integrated into UN peace operations in near future.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60353886, "asset_id": 40016167, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 38547206, "first_name": "Fahad", "last_name": "Nabeel", "domain_name": "nationaldefencenduislamabadpakistanu", "page_name": "fffFahadNabeel", "display_name": "Fahad Nabeel", "profile_url": "https://nationaldefencenduislamabadpakistanu.academia.edu/fffFahadNabeel?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/38547206/34059463/30091256/s65_fahad.nabeel.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6617, "name": "United Nations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/United_Nations?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11337, "name": "Cyber Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Warfare?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13078, "name": "Peacekeeping", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peacekeeping?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41862, "name": "Cyberwarfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberwarfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 127602, "name": "UN Peacekeeping", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/UN_Peacekeeping?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 234605, "name": "UN peacekeeping operations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/UN_peacekeeping_operations?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 279605, "name": "United Nations Peacekeeping Operations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/United_Nations_Peacekeeping_Operations?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 559844, "name": "Cyberspace Operations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace_Operations?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 689759, "name": "Cyber Attacks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Attacks?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 747790, "name": "Cyber Operations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Operations?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 3340617, "name": "Cyberpeacekeeping", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberpeacekeeping?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 36579107, "title": "CHINA-US CYBERSPACE ENGAGEMENTS - THE DRAGON DETHRONING THE EAGLE?", "created_at": "2018-05-07T03:33:06.509-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36579107/CHINA_US_CYBERSPACE_ENGAGEMENTS_THE_DRAGON_DETHRONING_THE_EAGLE?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_36579107", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56505789, "asset_id": 36579107, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3365740, "first_name": "Dr. E.", "last_name": "Dilipraj", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "EDilipraj", "display_name": "Dr. E.

In the last ten years, the realm of cybersecurity has exploded with public, professional, and academic interests. In his revolutionary work, Blown to Bits, Hal Abelson touches on the rapid growth of the digital world as a whole, remarking that \u201cThe world changed very suddenly\u2026the digital explosion is changing the world as much as printing once did \u2013 and some of the changes are catching us unaware, blowing to bits our assumptions about the way the world works\u2026\u201d (2-3). Abelson is one of many authors and innovators who have recognized how fundamentally the cyber world has influenced the daily lives of modernity. \n \nAmid this technological revolution, the importance of secure computing, data storage, and communication is at an unparalleled high, and it is not likely to see a decrease in priority. As the general public\u2019s usage and dependency on technology increases, so do the efforts to maintain a safe and stable infrastructure for those new technologies. Those efforts to tighten security are often hastened by the antagonistic countermovement of developments that are designed to threaten and destroy the same integrity that this new technology both necessitates and creates. World famous security expert Bruce Schneier\u2019s book, Beyond Fear, describes this direct relationship of the proliferation of these attacks and the defense thereof, writing \u201c\u2026and so changed the defensive front, just as quickly as the attacks did\u2026\u201d (Schneier, 5). It is not difficult to see how quickly one side will react to its opposition. This now-eternal struggle between the black and white hats continues to define how society operates; what is safe, what isn\u2019t and what needs to be met to ensure society operates status-quo. As this research demonstrates, it is very easy to disturb the fragile ecosystem of the cyber world. \n\nThe aim of this experiment is to offer an introduction to the exploding field of cybersecurity by asking what are the most important concepts or topics that a new member of the field of cybersecurity should know. It explores this question from three perspectives: from the realm of business and how the cyber world is intertwined with modern commerce, including common weaknesses and recommendations, from the academic arena examining how cybersecurity is taught and how it should be taught in a classroom or laboratory environment, and lastly, from the author\u2019s personal experience with the cyber world. Included information contains scholarly journals, news sources, special interest books, academic curricula, and relevant experience. By blending together information procured from these three distinct environments, this research proposes several of the most important concepts and lessons that one should know as they begin their career, whether professional or academic, in the cyber world.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52452760, "asset_id": 32227776, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 62504066, "first_name": "Anthony", "last_name": "Kelly", "domain_name": "lasalle", "page_name": "AnthonyKelly", "display_name": "Anthony Kelly", "profile_url": "https://lasalle.academia.edu/AnthonyKelly?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 62540834, "first_name": "Margaret", "last_name": "McCoey", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MargaretMcCoey", "display_name": "Margaret McCoey", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MargaretMcCoey?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 491, "name": "Information Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Technology?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20149, "name": "Information Assurance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Assurance?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 49374, "name": "Hacking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hacking?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 104623, "name": "All areas of Informatics, Educational technologies, Cyber Security & Forensics, Cyber Audit, ICT", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/All_areas_of_Informatics_Educational_technologies_Cyber_Security_and_Forensics_Cyber_Audit_ICT?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 647459, "name": "Cyber educational programs and schools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_educational_programs_and_schools?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 29911836, "title": "THE SYSTEM OF CONDITIONS FOR E-ACCEPTANCE AND ITS DEVELOPMENT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF INFORMATION SECURITY", "created_at": "2016-11-17T04:36:52.335-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29911836/THE_SYSTEM_OF_CONDITIONS_FOR_E_ACCEPTANCE_AND_ITS_DEVELOPMENT_FROM_THE_POINT_OF_VIEW_OF_INFORMATION_SECURITY?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_29911836", "summary": "All changes begin in the thoughts-this statement is undeniably established. Consequently, the right way of putting this question is to determine the required elements for a dynamic and sustainable change process, through which the e-acceptance can expand \u2013and it actually does expand- coupled with a securityconscious behaviour. The system of conditions for e-acceptance has to be analyzed from legal, technical\nand knowledge aspects. Hereby, our study attempts to present this system of conditions. Our goal is to analyse such elements like trust, education (via both formal and informal solutions), and the improvement\nof password usage trends, and we also endeavour to underpin their necessity. However, the highlighted subject of analysis is the matter of trust. Besides being a two-way process (alongside with client trust\nattention has to be payed to the trust of service providers), trust can be improved through two relevant elements: the aforementioned education and via creating alternative identification possibilities. Moreover,\nthe levels of trust concerning e-acceptance is also a subject for analysis, from the simple inclination of orientation/instruction, all the way to the e-vote inclination. Concerning the legal, technical and knowledge aspects, a common feature is the existence of information security and the necessary general mindset, the chances to access and handle IT systems, so these subjects also have to be examined. Our assumption is that the essential elements of e-acceptance conditions are trust and a deliberate, multi-channelled educational\nactivity. In the course of planning these elements, attention has to be given to the communication channel as well as the recipient of the message, in order to reach maximum efficacy. In this aspect, the trust-factor from the side of the user has to be taken care of with peculiar attentiveness, because the lack of trust can be such as significant obstacle for the spread of e-acceptance, as the lack of access to IT-tools.\nKeywords: e-acceptance, password usage, trust, education, password and information security consciousness,\nHungary, interoperability, password, information security, administration, information system", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50373097, "asset_id": 29911836, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12844452, "first_name": "Som", "last_name": "Zoltan", "domain_name": "uni-nke", "page_name": "SomZoltan", "display_name": "Som Zoltan", "profile_url": "https://uni-nke.academia.edu/SomZoltan?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12844452/3640387/4269475/s65_som.zoltan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 982, "name": "Cyberlaw", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberlaw?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29128, "name": "Cybercultures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercultures?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 61968, "name": "IT Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/IT_Governance?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 173623, "name": "IT Project Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/IT_Project_Management?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 33427639, "title": "You can trust me: a multimethod analysis of the Nigerian email scam", "created_at": "2017-06-12T14:15:01.945-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33427639/You_can_trust_me_a_multimethod_analysis_of_the_Nigerian_email_scam?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_33427639", "summary": "How do scammers invoke trust within the Nigerian email scam and how do recipients interpret such trust-laden offers?

We investigate that role along three dimensions: the first is theoretical and we look at existing cybersecurity literature, showing that international affairs literature is almost exclusively highlighting the role of the state as a security actor. We argue that this view is too narrow and risks limiting the discussion to only a few aspects of what cybersecurity entails. The second is empirical and we analyse policy development, showing the diversity of the roles the state imagines for itself. The state occupies six different roles in cybersecurity: (1) security guarantor, (2) legislator and regulator, (3) supporter and representative of the whole of society, (4) security partner, (5) knowledge generator and distributor, and (6) threat actor. The third dimension is normative and we investigate what the role of the state should be. To do that, we outline three main areas of tension between the state, the economy, and society in which cybersecurity policies are situated. Diverse coalitions of interests, spanning across the three social fields, support or challenge the six roles. Thus, two types of questions occupy the centre stage of cybersecurity policy: a question regarding the boundaries of responsibility (i.e., where does the responsibility of the state, economic, and societal actors start and end?) and a question regarding the concrete assumption of responsibilities (i.e., which means is an actor allowed to use to assume the responsibilities of his/her roles?). In sum, our conceptualisation enhances the understanding of cybersecurity as a diverse and crosscutting policy field. The result is a more comprehensive understanding of different roles of the state, which will help researchers with finding innovative research questions in the future.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62976858, "asset_id": 42756026, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1186596, "first_name": "Florian", "last_name": "Egloff", "domain_name": "ethz", "page_name": "FlorianEgloff", "display_name": "Florian J .

The current technological landscape is not without paradoxes and risks, which under certain circumstances may raise liability issues for market operators. In this article we illustrate the several challenges in terms of security and resilience that market operators face since overcoming those challenges is of strategic importance for businesses wishing to be deemed privacy-respectful and reliable market actors. After a brief overview of the potentialities and drawbacks deriving from the combination of big data and cloud computing, this paper illustrates the challenges and the obligations imposed by the European institutions on providers processing personal data \u2013 pursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation \u2013 and on providers of digital services and essential services \u2013 according to the NIS Directive. We also survey the European institution's push towards the development and adoption of codes of conduct, standards and certificates, as well as its last proposal for a new Cybersecurity Act. We conclude by showing that, despite this articulate framework, big data and cloud service providers still leverage their strong bargaining power to use \" contractual shield \" and escape liability.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57077473, "asset_id": 37125788, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2871125, "first_name": "Maria Lill\u00e0", "last_name": "Montagnani", "domain_name": "unibocconi", "page_name": "MariaLill\u00e0Montagnani", "display_name": "Maria Lill\u00e0 Montagnani", "profile_url": "https://unibocconi.academia.edu/MariaLill%C3%A0Montagnani?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2871125/2715637/3162250/s65_maria_lill_.montagnani.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 126300, "name": "Big Data", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Big_Data?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2659601, "name": "Platform liability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Platform_liability?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 26612108, "title": "What is cybersecurity?

It is often used situationally, in the sense that an individual\u2019s connected devices can be under attack, a corporation can be hacked or government-run, essential infrastructure can be at risk of attack. But it seems that the broadness of the term may have made an exploration of the theoretical aspects of cybersecurity difficult. Not many attempts have been made to understand cybersecurity from a higher level of abstraction. In this paper, it is stated that the broadness of the term is indeed appropriate, as cybersecurity is a multi-faceted phenomenon which nonetheless can be analyzed theoretically across all levels. The meaning of the term is explored further and an attempt to widen and deepen its reach as a concept is made. Cybersecurity is explored from a critical security studies angle as well as a critical theory angle. A distinction of the term from related concepts such as information security and computer security is put forward, and a taxonomy of cybersecurity is suggested. It is concluded that cybersecurity must necessarily be analyzed critically in order to fully understand the impacts and implications it has as a phenomenon, but that this analysis will inevitably lead to a multi-faceted, yet meaningful result.

"Technical security metrics provide measurements in ensuring the effectiveness of technical security controls or technology devices/objects that are used in protecting the information systems. However, lack of understanding and method to develop the technical security metrics may lead to unachievable security control objectives and incompetence of the implementation. This paper proposes a model of technical security metric to measure the effectiveness of network security management. The measurement is based on the effectiveness of security performance for (1) network security controls such as firewall, Intrusion Detection Prevention System (IDPS), switch, wireless access point, wireless controllers and network architecture; and (2) network services such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) and virtual private network (VPN). We use the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) paradigm [1] which links the measurement goals to measurement questions and produce the metrics that can easily be interpreted in compliance with the requirements. The outcome of this research method is the introduction of network security management metric as an attribute to the Technical Security Metric (TSM) model. Apparently, the proposed TSM model may provide guidance for organizations in complying with effective measurement requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management System (ISMS) standard. The proposed model will provide a comprehensive measurement and guidance to support the use of ISO/IEC 27004 ISMS Measurement template. \r\n\r\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37165690, "asset_id": 11731905, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2328357, "first_name": "Journal of Computer Science", "last_name": "IJCSIS", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JournalofComputerScienceIJCSIS", "display_name": "Journal of Computer Science IJCSIS", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JournalofComputerScienceIJCSIS?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2328357/8085511/9052483/s65_journal_of_computer_science.ijcsis.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3703, "name": "Network Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Network_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13923, "name": "Computer Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 51281, "name": "Networks Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Networks_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 92883, "name": "Security Metrics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_Metrics?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 27453222, "title": "Darknet and Deepnet Mining for Proactive Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence", "created_at": "2016-08-01T21:09:17.877-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27453222/Darknet_and_Deepnet_Mining_for_Proactive_Cybersecurity_Threat_Intelligence?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_27453222", "summary": "\u2014In this paper, we present an operational system for cyber threat intelligence gathering from various social platforms on the Internet particularly sites on the darknet and deepnet. We focus our attention to collecting information from hacker forum discussions and marketplaces offering products and services focusing on malicious hacking. We have developed an operational system for obtaining information from these sites for the purposes of identifying emerging cyber threats. Currently, this system collects on average 305 high-quality cyber threat warnings each week. These threat warnings include information on newly developed malware and exploits that have not yet been deployed in a cyber-attack. This provides a significant service to cyber-defenders.

This article develops an alternative viewpoint, exploring the analogy between cyberspace and another largely ungoverned space: the sea in the age of privateering. This comparison enables us to incorporate into cybersecurity thinking the complex interactions between state and non- state actors, including entities such as navies, mercantile companies, pirates, and privateers. The paper provides a short historical overview of privateering and cybersecurity and compares the two by identifying state actors, semi-state actors, and criminal actors in each historical context. The paper identifies the limitations of Cold War analogies and presents the analogy of privateering as a superior conceptual benchmark for future policy guidance on cybersecurity. The paper makes three main arguments. First, cyber actors are comparable to the actors of maritime warfare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Second, the militarisation of cyberspace resembles the situation in the sixteenth century, when states transitioned from a reliance on privateers to dependence on professional navies. Third, as with privateering, the use of non-state actors by states in cyberspace has produced unintended harmful consequences; the emergence of a regime against privateering provides potentially fruitful lessons for international cooperation and the management of these consequences.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38773539, "asset_id": 15714412, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1186596, "first_name": "Florian", "last_name": "Egloff", "domain_name": "ethz", "page_name": "FlorianEgloff", "display_name": "Florian J .

The advent of Aadhaar Act in 2016 and Government's mandate of linking Aadhaar with PAN had mooted up the issue of Privacy once again. Article 21 of the Constitution provides privacy to the citizens but only to a limited extent, which was put to question in several instances. The entire nation anticipates the decision of the Aadhaar Case. The judgment in the case of Justice Puttaswamy famously known as the Privacy Case finally arrived on 24th August 2017, which will directly impact several cases of Aadhaar pending before the Supreme court. Meanwhile, the Legislators have kept a blind eye to the long awaited Privacy Protection Bill of 2011. While concern over Individuals Privacy continued to vacillate until recently, the judgment has clarified situations to a large extent. Other sectors such as banking and welfare have brought forth their own rules to regulate Privacy concern. The article discusses the present legal situation of Privacy under various legislations, the impact of recent privacy judgment in India and analyses whether the current regulations created by various authorities such as SEBI, RBI, IRDAI have something substantial to offer or are just there to mellow down the daunting public.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55540206, "asset_id": 35669488,

Nella seconda parte si presentano, invece, le considerazioni elaborate dalle aziende leader del settore che hanno sponsorizzato il corso: BV Tech, IDS, Leonardo (ex Finmeccanica), Microsoft e Unipol.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50898639, "asset_id": 30458368, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 276990, "first_name": "Raffaele", "last_name": "Marchetti", "domain_name": "luiss", "page_name": "RaffaeleMarchetti", "display_name": "Raffaele Marchetti", "profile_url": "https://luiss.academia.edu/RaffaeleMarchetti?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/276990/476081/16457837/s65_raffaele.marchetti.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 799, "name": "Public Administration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Administration?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 982, "name": "Cyberlaw", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberlaw?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2511, "name": "Cybercrimes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrimes?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4181, "name": "Cybernetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybernetics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4370, "name": "Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 5523, "name": "Security Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_Studies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 7057, "name": "Cyberstudies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberstudies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 11336, "name": "Cyber Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Terrorism?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 11337, "name": "Cyber Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Warfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 11470, "name": "Cyberculture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberculture?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 20594, "name": "Cyber crime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_crime?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 29128, "name": "Cybercultures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercultures?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 41862, "name": "Cyberwarfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberwarfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 65430, "name": "Cyber Physical Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Physical_Systems?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 89751, "name": "Cybercrime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrime?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 96546, "name": "Cyber Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 162629, "name": "Cyber Laws and Cyber Crime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Laws_and_Cyber_Crime?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 349591, "name": "Pubblica Amministrazione", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pubblica_Amministrazione?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 475503, "name": "Sicurezza", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sicurezza?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 717488, "name": "Cybercrime-Terrorusm", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrime-Terrorusm?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 728224, "name": "Cibernetica", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cibernetica?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1222790, "name": "Cyber Crime and Technological Advancements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Crime_and_Technological_Advancements?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 47766433, "title": "PLATFORMA PRZECIWDZIA\u0141ANIA DEZINFORMACJI -

Unfortunately, the greater Caspian region has and does experience these various forms of instability in one degree or another across many of its states. But one of the lesser appreciated aspects of domestic, regional, and international turmoil is how often the kernels of opportunity and progress can reside simultaneously within these seeds of discord and conflict. Issue No. 23 of the GCP examines this fascinating phenomenon in earnest. What our devoted readers will discover is how instability in and of itself does not need to be immutable: opportunities of leadership, achievement, and positive change do exist and can blossom, even in areas we currently consider to be hopelessly opaque and convoluted. In many cases it is just a matter of perception and where the relevant actors are willing to focus their energies, as well as the under-emphasized essentiality of not being afraid of change and not being enslaved to the status quo. \nThus it is with this issue we try to reveal these hidden opportunities while still seriously analyzing such troubling concerns as separatism, economic crisis, geostrategic manipulation of natural resources, theocratic evolution, cyber innovation, and transnational policing. We are by no means here at the GCP and our parent group Modern Diplomacy pie-in-the-sky-Ivory-Tower na\u00efve scholars: we know that in all of these issues, across all of these cases, when the pendulum swings more to the end of crisis, then the end result is unfortunately untold human suffering and sacrifice. But despite this we still force our readers to recognize that it is indeed a pendulum and not a compass: the direction it presently points does not have to be a fixed geographical consideration, but is rather a dynamic process that can move and shift to something more positively powerful. It may only be a hope, in some cases perhaps even an unrealistic one. But hope is never a bad thing, especially in our GCP world of diplomacy, geopolitics, and international security. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45346563, "asset_id": 25022812, "asset_type":

that is mainly state-centric-it challenges the traditional concepts like security, borders, privacy and sovereignty. Legal discussions about cyberspace governance often focus on international cybercrime arrangements, international standards and national sovereignty. Due to the globalisation and the interconnected nature of cyberspace and the cross-border impacts of attacks, it has been made impossible for any organisation to manage cyberspace and cyber threats without an adequate level of cooperation with various partners and allies.

Assange has characterized secrecy as both a form and symptom of corruption, and ultimately as the foundation of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d of governance that states like the U.S. inflict on their subjects and the world. He advocates a non-political, vigilante form of transparency in which WikiLeaks serves as a neutral entity that will save the public and free the world with information. He predicted that corrupt political orders would fall as the threat of exposure forces the collapse of their conspiratorial communication networks. But WikiLeaks has failed not only to save the world but to save itself from politics\u2014and in the process has itself become a bit player in the larger geo-political drama that it had hoped to disrupt. Assange\u2019s theory of information disclosure, as well as his assumptions about the state and governing institutions, have proven far too descriptively and normatively simple. More prominent, less radical theories of transparency should take note of these failures to the extent that they share many of his assumptions.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58272942, "asset_id": 38231905, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4582869, "first_name": "Mark", "last_name": "Fenster", "domain_name": "florida", "page_name": "MarkFenster", "display_name": "Mark Fenster", "profile_url": "https://florida.academia.edu/MarkFenster?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4582869/17539366/17605552/s65_mark.fenster.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6662, "name": "Secrecy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Secrecy?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 49374, "name": "Hacking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hacking?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 59537, "name": "Transparency", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transparency?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 67267, "name": "Wikileaks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wikileaks?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 131991, "name": "Government transparency", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Government_transparency?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 218938, "name": "Julian Assange", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Julian_Assange?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 833074, "name": "Leaking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Leaking?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1250479, "name": "Donald Trump", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Donald_Trump?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 3104159, "name": "Robert Mueller's Special Counsel Investigation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Robert_Muellers_Special_Counsel_Investigation?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 36264880, "title": "Proportional Response to Cyberattacks", "created_at": "2018-03-27T02:13:02.528-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36264880/Proportional_Response_to_Cyberattacks?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_36264880", "summary": "Analysis in recent years demonstrates that government responses to cyberattacks vary widely. Although there has been significant political pressure to \" do something, \" past experiences illustrate that most policy responses are ad hoc. This indicates that 1) response to cyberattacks is still an exceedingly untested phenomenon; 2) cyber domain is a relatively new arena of conflict\u2014especially for the policymakers\u2014and, therefore, special attention should be directed towards it; and 3) more research is needed to understand how nation-states could best respond to cyber hostilities and which instruments should be used. This article analyzes comprehensively how cyberattacks should be treated as a political question and provides a rough framework upon which policymakers can build. The article presents five variables that policymakers need to consider when evaluating appropriate responses to cyber hostilities. Combining incident impact, policy options, and other variables, the framework outlines the different levers of cyberpolitics that can be applied in response to the escalating levels of cyber incidents. The response framework is also an integral part of the state's cyber deterrence.\n\n , , cyber warfare, ,\npolitics,, response, ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56170220, "asset_id": 36264880, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 79473788, "first_name": "Cyber, Intelligence, and Security", "last_name": "INSS", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "CyberIntelligenceandSecurityINSS", "display_name": "Cyber, Intelligence, and Security INSS", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/CyberIntelligenceandSecurityINSS?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/79473788/19383801/19299986/s65_cyber_intelligence_and_security.inss.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 59103, "name": "Cyberpolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberpolitics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 225158, "name": "International Law State Responsibility Cyberspace Cyberterrorism Cyberattacks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Law_State_Responsibility_Cyberspace_Cyberterrorism_Cyberattacks?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1822933, "name": "HYBRID THREATS, CYBER WARFARE AND NATO\u2019S COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH FOR COUNTERING 21st CENTURY THREATS \u2013 MAPPING THE NEW FRONTIER OF GLOBAL RISK AND SECURITY MANAGEMENT", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/HYBRID_THREATS_CYBER_WARFARE_AND_NATO_S_COMPREHENSIVE_APPROACH_FOR_COUNTERING_21st_CENTURY_THREATS_?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35349686, "title": "Blockchain Security and Demonstration", "created_at": "2017-12-05T14:13:21.528-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35349686/Blockchain_Security_and_Demonstration?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_35349686", "summary": "Blockchain promises greater speed, security, accuracy, and transparency for every electronic transactional or record-keeping process.

Hampir seluruh perusahaan memanfaatkan aset teknologi informasi untuk mengelola bisnis mereka. Demi menjaga aset perusahaan tersebut, banyak perusahaan menempuh segala cara agar keamanan sistem infrastruktur jaringan IT perusahaannya terhindar dari para peretas. Salah satunya dengan menggunakan metode vulnerability assessment (VA) sebagai bahan pengujian. Guna mengatasi ancaman keamanan yang ada, perlu dimaksimalkan dengan menyusun kerangka manajemen risiko berdasarkan pedoman dari project management body of knowledge (PMBOK) dimana menjadi salah satu fokus yang diteliti pada jurnal ini. Berdasarkan hasil kajian yang dilakukan, faktor penentu yang mempengaruhi aman atau tidaknya suatu sistem infrastruktur jaringan IT terletak pada bagian identifikasi risiko dan melakukan perencanaan mitigasi menggunakan tools BigFix pada hasil VA demi mengendalikan dan mengantisipasi segala bentuk risiko terjadinya serangan cyber.\n\nKeywords \u2013 cybersecurity, teknologi informasi, infrastruktur jaringan, BigFix, vulnerability assessment, manajemen risiko\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60975415, "asset_id": 40691662, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 27034434, "first_name": "Iwan", "last_name": "Krisnadi", "domain_name": "mercubuana", "page_name": "IwanKrisnadi", "display_name": "Iwan  Krisnadi", "profile_url": "https://mercubuana.academia.edu/IwanKrisnadi?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/27034434/7605213/8536128/s65_iwan.krisnadi.jpg_oh_9ea519cf9279e2443e55026ace37b176_oe_558254ab___gda___1434509100_b6ae181b2e5e840c25d516202351ebe5"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7439, "name": "Risk and Vulnerability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Risk_and_Vulnerability?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 417875, "name": "Network Infrastructure", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Network_Infrastructure?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36678157, "title": "The Governance of Risks in Ridesharing: A Revelatory Case from Singapore", "created_at": "2018-05-20T23:01:46.741-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36678157/The_Governance_of_Risks_in_Ridesharing_A_Revelatory_Case_from_Singapore?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_36678157", "summary": "Recently we have witnessed the worldwide adoption of many different types of innovative technologies, such as crowdsourcing, ridesharing, open and big data, aiming at delivering public services more efficiently and effectively. Among them, ridesharing has received substantial attention from decision-makers around the world. Because of the multitude of currently understood or potentially unknown risks associated with ridesharing (unemployment, insurance, information privacy, and environmental risk), governments in different countries apply different strategies to address such risks. Some governments prohibit the adoption of ridesharing altogether, while other governments promote it. In this article, we address the question of how risks involved in ridesharing are governed over time. We present an in-depth single case study on Singapore and examine how the Singaporean government has addressed risks in ridesharing over time. The Singaporean government has a strong ambition to become an innovation hub, and many innovative technologies have been adopted and promoted to that end. At the same time, decision-makers in Singapore are reputed for their proactive style of social governance. The example of Singapore can be regarded as a revelatory case study, helping us further to explore governance practices in other countries.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56615313, "asset_id":

"dom_id": "work_25352365", "summary": "The intent of this chapter is to re-imagine and apply the term \" civil disobedience \" to the cyber domain. The full extent of how it can apply will be analyzed in a framework of the evolutionary rights of protest. Traditional civil disobedience is a \" performance \" via visual and physical mediums, while cyber disobedience is essentially a digital performance with difficulty in attributing true ownership of the act. This is an interesting antithesis to the physical protestor, who uses strategic visibility, threat of arrest, and popular backlash against state behavior as vital aspects of the disobedience. These variables are noticeably absent in cyber disobedience.

In 2016, according to the Internet Crime Complaint Center, US residents reported losing over $1.3 billion because of cybercrime.  This course will explore issues surrounding cybercrime through a social science perspective.   \r\n\r\nThis course has four goals:\r\n\r\n1. Students will gain a basic understanding of the architecture of the Internet.  Students need knowledge of how computers communicate through interconnected networks in order to understand how many cybercrimes are committed.\r\n\r\n2. Students will explore the most common types of cybercrimes.  Cybercrimes can be roughly divided into four categories \u2013 cybertresspass, cyberpornography, cyberviolence, and cyberdeception.\r\n\r\n3. Students will critique the major debates surrounding cybercrime.  Society\u2019s understanding of what should be prohibited, how we should investigate, and how we should prosecute cybercrime are continuously being negotiated by groups in society.  Our social world is socially constructed, and issues surrounding cybercrime are no different.\r\n\r\n4. Students will connect cybercrimes to wider social impacts as they relate to individuals and families.  While cybersecurity courses may focus more on the concerns of corporations and governments and how to protect the data within them, a cybercrime course focuses more on how everyday people are victimized. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57254538, "asset_id": 34589623, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6504929, "first_name": "Roderick", "last_name": "Graham", "domain_name": "odu", "page_name": "RoderickGraham", "display_name": "Roderick Graham", "profile_url": "https://odu.academia.edu/RoderickGraham?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6504929/3378319/31770586/s65_roderick.graham.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 982, "name": "Cyberlaw", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberlaw?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2511, "name": "Cybercrimes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrimes?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20594, "name": "Cyber crime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_crime?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 260024, "name": "Digital Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Sociology?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 28711253, "title": "Strategie cyberbezpiecze\u0144stwa pa\u0144stw \u015brodkowoeuropejskich i kraj\u00f3w ba\u0142tyckich - analiza por\u00f3wnawcza; Cybersecurity Strategies of the Central European Countries and the Baltic States - Comparative Analysis", "created_at": "2016-09-25T14:10:57.884-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28711253/Strategie_cyberbezpiecze%C5%84stwa_pa%C5%84stw_%C5%9Brodkowoeuropejskich_i_kraj%C3%B3w_ba%C5%82tyckich_analiza_por%C3%B3wnawcza_Cybersecurity_Strategies_of_the_Central_European_Countries_and_the_Baltic_States_Comparative_Analysis?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_28711253", "summary": "The chapter raises the question of national cyber strategies adopted by the governments of the Baltic States and Central European countries.

The cyberspace users who can be described as the Cyberians are attracted to the cyberspace from time to time especially because of the various opportunities/activities available via the cyberspace cutting across many spheres of human endeavor. There are however many threats or challenges which may be inimical to the safety of the cyberspace, the cyberspace assets/resources and the interest of the Cyberians, the regular cyberspace users or cyber citizens. This paper, based on extensive examination of contemporary literature on the cyberspace, explores fundamental activities of the cyberspace and explicates various forms of cybercrimes orchestrated by cyber criminals posing great threats to the cyberspace.

Today cybersecurity is introduced at the high school level, incorporated into undergraduate computer science and information systems programs, and has resulted in a variety of cybersecurity-specific graduate programs. However, is that even enough? Is cybersecurity so broad that education needs to be more specialized? Employers want graduates who can hit the ground running: not in the broad field of cybersecurity but in some very specific areas.\nThis paper is structured as follows. First, we will provide a brief overview of the current approaches to cybersecurity education including government standards bodies such as the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework, the upcoming changes in the National Information Assurance (IA) Education and Training Programs (NIETP) Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) designation requirements, and the Department of Labor competency model. Second, we will present a framework for curriculum changes, which we use to determine the viability of information technology/information systems (IS/IT) curriculum changes to our departmental educational offerings.

The nuclear domain is a case in point: nuclear weapons, materials and facilities are vulnerable to accidents, sabotage or theft, in incidents that can have a cyber dimension. Cyber attacks on nuclear facilities are known to have occurred in the recent past, others could have gone unreported, and numerous scenarios can be envisaged that could have destabilizing or even catastrophic consequences for humankind. This Policy Brief explores cyber threats of varying degrees of probability in the civil and military nuclear spheres: it assesses the measures that are being taken to improve cyber security at nuclear

emerged as a strategic domain for state interactions but its strong potential for espionage, sabotage and subversion, has also made it a predominant source of insecurity. While the Philippines are still trying to make strategic sense of cyberspace, the idea of a \"cyber revolution\" has militarized the responses of powerful states, advancing the development of capabilities for computer network operations. The cyber revolution is based on three widely held assumptions by Western military forces: cyberspace enables asymmetric advantages; cyberspace is offense-dominant; and deterrence is ultimately difficult. Following this trend, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) developed a \"Cyber Group\" with the support of the United States, to strengthen the capacity of the military to protect state interests in cyberspace. While securing cyberspace is an inescapable task for any government, the AFP cannot exploit the advantages of networked technologies ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64036494, "asset_id": 43727518, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1107711, "first_name": "Francis", "last_name": "Domingo", "domain_name": "dlsu", "page_name": "FrancisDomingo", "display_name": "Francis C .

Given these conditions, the timing of this agreement was surprising. I argue that state representatives engaged in a rule-governed social practice of applying old rules to new cases, and that the procedural rules governing this practice help to explain the existence, timing and form of the agreement. They also help to explain further agreements expressed in a follow-on report issued in 2015. The case study findings presented here demonstrate that social practices of rule-making are simultaneously rule-governed and politically contested, and that outcomes of these processes have been shaped by specialized rules for making, interpreting and applying rules. The effectiveness of procedural rules in shaping the outcome of a contentious, complex global security issue suggests that such rules are likely to matter even more in simpler cases dealing with less contentious issues.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62186760, "asset_id": 23339534, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9297423, "first_name":

egzistencije uslovio je stvaranje i kreiranje interneta. \nIako je ideja (nastanka) interneta, izme\u0111u ostalog, mogu\u0107nost povezivanja lica zajedni\u010dkih interesovanja u cilju afirmisanja vlastitih ideja, stavova i znanja, te koncentrisanje cjelokupnog ljudskog znanja kako bi se ono konkretizovalo i nesmetano koristilo za sve subjekte \u010dovje\u010danstva premo\u0161\u0107avanjem brojnih do tada postoje\u0107ih barijera (administrativne, kulturolo\u0161ke, lokacijske, formalne, fakti\u010dke, tehnolo\u0161ke...), uz izvjesnu rezervisanost se mo\u017ee re\u0107i da je internet, s jedne strane, postao upravo surogat navedenih (po\u010detnih) ideja koje su vremenom dobile karakter utopisti\u010dkih (naravno, ne negiraju\u0107i da je uspio da afirmi\u0161e i podstakne izvjesnu elitisti\u010dku, informacionu, komunikacijsku i resursnu koncentrisanost), dok je, s druge strane, \u0161to je mo\u017eda i bitnije, ukazao i na ''mra\u010dnu stranu'' tehnolo\u0161kog i uop\u0161te civilizacijskog napretka koja se ogleda kroz mnogobrojna naru\u0161avanja bezbjednosti, bez obzira na to kako se ona, odnosno u kom segmentu i obliku posmatra (li\u010dna, kolektivna, globalna, nacionalna, tehni\u010dka...). Naravno, danak navedenom su platili i pla\u0107aju upravo korisnici interneta (internauti), a posredno i cjelokupna populacija \u010dovje\u010danstva, kao i niz drugih subjekata kojima je bezbjednost, kao i niz prava i sloboda ugro\u017eena.  \nPojam interneta spada u jedan od onih op\u0161teprihva\u0107enih pojmova koji se u svakodnevnom govoru \u010desto koriste i za koji ve\u0107ina (mla\u0111ih) internauta smatra da zna \u0161ta se pod tim pojmom podrazumijeva, ali je veoma te\u0161ko diferencirati njegov pojam, odnosno odrediti njegovu su\u0161tinu. Odre\u0111ivanje pojma interneta je ote\u017eano, prije svega, \u010dinjenicom da internet ne predstavlja samo globalnu mre\u017eu informacija (''multimedijalni autoput informacija''), niti komunikacijsku tvorevinu, odnosno ne posmatra se (samo) kao medij, ve\u0107 on predstavlja daleko vi\u0161e u \u017eivotu svakog savremenog \u010dovjeka, usljed \u010dega se mo\u017ee posmatrati sa razli\u010ditih aspekata: govori se o internetu u informativnom i komunikacijskom smislu, o internetu kao o mediju, zatim o defendolo\u0161kom aspektu interneta (internetu kao faktoru li\u010dne, nacionalne i globalne bezbjednosti), o internetu kao ekonomskoj kategoriji, o uticaju interneta na dru\u0161tvo, o pedago\u0161ko-andrago\u0161kom aspektu interneta, o internetu sa tehni\u010dko-tehnolo\u0161kog aspekta...\nPrema jednoj od najop\u0161tijih definicija, internet predstavlja globalni komunikacioni sistem me\u0111usobno povezanih ra\u010dunarskih mre\u017ea namijenjen razmjeni podataka razli\u010ditih tipova. \nSvakako jedan od najbitnijih faktora, pogotovo sa defendolo\u0161kog aspekta jeste posmatranje interneta kao faktora bezbjednosti. Internet se mo\u017ee posmatrati i kao faktor ugro\u017eavanja bezbjednosti, ali i kao faktor uspostavljanja i konsolidovanja naru\u0161ene bezbjednosti. Naime, internet u dana\u0161nje vrijeme slu\u017ei kao veoma mo\u0107no sredstvo za teroriste, kao i za vr\u0161enje krivi\u010dnih djela, kao sredstvo \u0161irenja propagande, nemoralnih sadr\u017eaja, raznih nacionalisti\u010dkih, retrogradnih i drugih dru\u0161tveno i globalno neprihvatljivih ideja, dok, s druge strane, internet (mo\u017ee da) slu\u017ei i kao sredstvo pronalaska izvr\u0161ioca krivi\u010dnih djela, kao i sredstvo suzbijanja kriminaliteta, kao na\u010din eliminisanja mogu\u0107nosti za izvo\u0111enje odre\u0111enih teroristi\u010dkih akata i sli\u010dno...\nAnaliziraju\u0107i mnogobrojne bezbjednosne incidente, rizike i opasnosti kori\u0161\u0107enja interneta, te imaju\u0107i u vidu implikacije koje internet ima i na realno okru\u017eenje, ne podrazumijevaju\u0107i pod navedenim samo sa\u017eivljenost, pa i sinergijsku inkorporiranost internet i realnog okru\u017eenja, sve bi ih mogli klasifikovati u dvije grupacije. Pod prvom grupacijom bi se moglo posmatrati ispoljavanje kriminalnih aktivnosti u internet okru\u017eenju, usljed \u010dega bi se navedeno moglo smatrati internet kriminalitetom kao specifi\u010dnim (sui generis) oblikom ispoljavanja tradicionalnih (ali i savremenih) oblika krivi\u010dnih djela u drugom okru\u017eenju, dok bi se pod drugom grupacijom bezbjednosnih incidenata u internet okru\u017eenju ili iniciranih, uslovljenih ili na drugi na\u010din povezanih incidenata sa internetom mogli posmatrati mnogobrojni oblici naru\u0161avanja privatnosti internauta, ali i populacije \u010dovje\u010danstva koji nu\u017eno i ne moraju biti korisnici interneta. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36250369, "asset_id": 10138746, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24181677, "first_name": "Aleksandar", "last_name": "Miladinovic", "domain_name": "muprs", "page_name": "AleksandarMiladinovic", "display_name": "Aleksandar Miladinovic", "profile_url": "https://muprs.academia.edu/AleksandarMiladinovic?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24181677/6528485/7381772/s65_aleksandar.miladinovic.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2511, "name": "Cybercrimes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrimes?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30947, "name": "The Internet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Internet?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 43789519, "title": "Detection of Cyberbullying in Tweets in Egyptian Dialects", "created_at": "2020-08-05T09:16:42.330-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43789519/Detection_of_Cyberbullying_in_Tweets_in_Egyptian_Dialects?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_43789519", "summary": "Egypt has been witnessing a rapid growth in social networking which definitely helped a lot in connecting people with their family and friends, in the mean while it is well known that social networking is a double-edged weapon which on the other side led to the increase of cyberbullying rates especially between teenagers. This research proposes an enhanced model to detect cyberbullying on the social networks utilizing sentiment analysis for Arabic language. There is a lack of existing researches in Arabic sentiment analysis compared to English, because of the unique nature and difficulty of the Arabic language which leads to shortage in Arabic datasets used in sentiment analysis. For the purpose of this paper a dataset of Modern Arabic, Egyptian Arabic Dialects and Emojis was compiled for Sentiment Analysis (SA) tasks. Our main purpose is detecting cyberbullying with the highest accuracy that we can achieve. We opted to add two additional factors to Sentiment Analysis, The Emojis and User History. Our algorithm achieved more accuracy analyzing positive hashtags compared to its accuracy dealing with bully hashtags despite that we still maintained a minimum accuracy score higher than 73% for these bully hashtags.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64104845, "asset_id": 43789519, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2328357, "first_name": "Journal of Computer Science", "last_name": "IJCSIS", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JournalofComputerScienceIJCSIS", "display_name": "Journal of Computer Science IJCSIS", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JournalofComputerScienceIJCSIS?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2328357/8085511/9052483/s65_journal_of_computer_science.ijcsis.jpg"}, {"id": 134459203, "first_name": "Neamat", "last_name": "Tazi", "domain_name": "cairo", "page_name": "NTazi", "display_name": "Neamat Tazi", "profile_url": "https://cairo.academia.edu/NTazi?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 37, "name": "Information Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Systems?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 491, "name": "Information Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Technology?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9246, "name": "Social Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12756, "name": "Cyberbullying", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberbullying?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 13923, "name": "Computer Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 20594, "name": "Cyber crime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_crime?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 36776995, "title": "L'impact du num\u00e9rique dans les relations strat\u00e9giques Internationales", "created_at": "2018-06-04T09:55:06.627-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36776995/Limpact_du_num%C3%A9rique_dans_les_relations_strat%C3%A9giques_Internationales?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_36776995", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56724787, "asset_id": 36776995, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 23351403, "first_name": "St\u00e9phane", "last_name": "Taillat", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "STaillat", "display_name": "St\u00e9phane Taillat", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/STaillat?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/23351403/6340395/7174967/s65_st_phane.taillat.jpg_oh_ade2d8f375efe62a60b0ca134b15474e_oe_550ce9e9___gda___1426739796_200d265da26de8d08e7a758a437a5b81"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46271, "name": "Strategy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Strategy?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 896186, "name": "Offense-defense Balance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Offense-defense_Balance?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 17503548, "title": "CYBER SECURITY CHALLENGES FOR INDIA - AN ASSESSMENT OF ITS PREPAREDNESS", "created_at": "2015-10-30T01:41:16.907-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/17503548/CYBER_SECURITY_CHALLENGES_FOR_INDIA_AN_ASSESSMENT_OF_ITS_PREPAREDNESS?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_17503548", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39546177, "asset_id": 17503548, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3365740, "first_name": "Dr. E.", "last_name": "Dilipraj", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "EDilipraj", "display_name": "Dr. E.

Security programs primarily focus on prevention-based strategies aimed at stopping attackers from getting into the network. These programs attempt to use hardened perimeters and endpoint defenses by recognizing and blocking malicious activities to detect and stop attackers before they can get in. Most organizations implement such a strategy by fortifying their networks with defense-in-depth through layered prevention controls. Detection controls are usually placed to augment prevention at the perimeter, and not as consistently deployed for in-network threat detection. This architecture leaves detection gaps that are dif\ufb01cult to \ufb01ll with existing security controls not speci\ufb01cally designed for that role. Rather than using prevention alone, a strategy that attackers have consistently succeeded against, defenders\nare adopting a more balanced strategy that includes detection and response. Most organizations deploy an intrusion detection system (IDS) or next-generation \ufb01rewall that picks up known attacks or attempts to pattern match for identi\ufb01cation. Other detection tools use monitoring, traf\ufb01c, or behavioral analysis. These reactive defenses are designed to detect once they are attacked yet often fail. They also have some limitations because they are not designed to catch credential harvesting or attacks based on what appears as authorized access. They are also often seen as complex and prone to false positives, adding to analyst alert fatigue. The security industry has focused recent innovation\non \ufb01nding more accurate ways to recognize malicious activity with technologies such as user and entity behavioral analytics (UEBA), big data, arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI), and deception.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66847440, "asset_id": 48021932, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5480779, "first_name": "Dr. Andrija", "last_name": "Kozina,  assistant professor", "domain_name": "unizg", "page_name": "AndrijaKozinaPhD", "display_name": "Dr. Andrija Kozina,  assistant professor", "profile_url": "https://unizg.academia.edu/AndrijaKozinaPhD?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5480779/2540864/15344868/s65_andrija.kozina.png"}, {"id": 192816808, "first_name": "William", "last_name": "Steingartner", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "WilliamSteingartner", "display_name": "William Steingartner", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/WilliamSteingartner?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1996380, "name": "Cybersecurity Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity_Education?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 33093081, "title": "2017_Article_CMA_Vuln_research_2017_03_27_SSRN.pdf", "created_at": "2017-05-19T02:14:07.079-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33093081/2017_Article_CMA_Vuln_research_2017_03_27_SSRN_pdf?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_33093081", "summary": "Despite the recent push towards security by design, most softwares and hardwares on the market still include numerous vulnerabilities, i.e. flaws or weaknesses whose discovery and exploitation by criminal hackers compromise the security of the networked and information systems, affecting millions of users, as acknowledged by the 2016 UK Government in its Cybersecurity Strategy.\n\nConversely, when security researchers find and timely disclose vulnerabilities to vendors who supply the IT products or who provide a service dependent on the IT products, they increase the opportunities for vendors to remove the vulnerabilities and close the security gap. They thus significantly contribute to the fight against cybercrime and, more widely, to the management of the digital security risk.\n\nHowever, in 2015, the European Network and Information Security Agency concluded that the threat of prosecution under EU and US computer misuse legislations \u2018can have a chilling effect\u2019, with security researchers \u2018discentivise[d]\u2019 to find vulnerabilities.\n\nTaking stock of these significant, but substantially understudied, criminal law challenges that these security researchers face in the UK when working independently, without the vendors\u2019 prior authorisation, this paper proposes a new defence to the offences under the Computer Misuse Act, an innovative solution to be built in light of both the scientific literature on vulnerability research and the exemption proposals envisaged prior to the Computer Misuse Act 1990. This paper argues that a defence would allow security researchers, if prosecuted, to demonstrate that contrary to criminal hackers, they acted in the public interest and proportionally.

The greater Caspian region encompasses areas of the world that extend all the way from the Atlantic to the Pacific when you consider the geostrategic tentacles that come from the decisions made. This issue lets readers see that process in explicit detail as subjects cut across Russia, Iran, the Middle East, South Asia, all the way out to Eastern China. As is often the case in the world of global affairs and international relations, the tiniest of decisions can have subtle consequences that grow into huge consequences. GCP No. 20 shows us all how real that is. \n\nTruly, this edition may have the largest coverage of disparate countries to date, with our readers learning subtle foreign policy issues and diplomatic nuances from Russia to Iran to Saudi Arabia to Syria to Kazakhstan to India to China to North Korea. Whether considering strategies to end war in Syria, preventing war in North Korea, stopping degradation in Kazakhstan, or ameliorating tension between major rivals in the Middle East, No. 20 makes us all realize just how complicated the world is today and why local problems often turn into regional discord which explodes into global tension and conflict. \n\nIn the end, we here at Modern Diplomacy and the GCP remain steadfast and true to the idea that no idea is sacred, no one position is the ultimate truth, and our only true purpose is exposing ever more people to the world as it really is, to the intricate actions and inner workings of states in the global neighborhood game as they actually transpire. We hope it always helps our readers become more informed and more refined in their thinking and perspectives. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 41896157, "asset_id": 21470377, "asset_type":

Cybercrime activities have become so serious that many developing countries have adopted various preventative and defensive approaches such as Internet regulation and establishment of organisations that address cybercrime issues. In order for cybercrime to be 11/9/2020 Cybercrime in Eswatini: The deterrence theory approach | ensovoort ensovoort.com/cybercrime-in-eswatini-the-deterrence-theory-approach/ 2/17 committed, there must be the existence of cyberspace which is the globally interconnected information infrastructure that includes the Internet and telecommunications networks. The banking sector has become one of the most a ected industries due to the concentration of nancial wealth. To address this issue, various mechanisms and approaches have been implemented such as putting up deterrent measures against cybercrime. To prevent cybercrime, organisations and individuals need to understand the cybercrime trends. With the increase of cybercrime activities in the banks, various strategies have been used. However, there has been a growing interest in applying the concept of deterrence to cybercrime. In simple terms, deterrence is all about convincing an opponent that the potential value gained in orchestrating an attack is not worth the potential cost to be expended. One of the strengths of the deterrence theory is that it involves a degree of threat from both sides whereby each entity holds enough capability to harm one another. Cybercriminals are constantly looking for ways to attack vulnerable organizations and the recent COVID-19 pandemic has provided such an opportunity. Hence this concept paper seeks to propose a model which can be used to gain understanding of how cybercrime can be prevented through the application of the deterrence theory.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64916571, "asset_id": 44484823, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 544501, "first_name": "Emmanuel", "last_name": "Howe", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "EmmanuelHowe", "display_name": "Emmanuel L .

This deliverable adopts a legal and ethical approach in order to provide legal and ethical guidance to the SAFECARE Consortium Partners in the development and testing of technologies as well in the implementation of the research project. To this end, three dimensions have been taken into account:\n\n1) The first one relates to the protection of medical information. To this regard, privacy and data protection are concepts of main importance. Privacy is recognised by Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights recognises privacy as the right to respect one individual\u2019s \u2018private and family life, his home and correspondence\u2019. The right to privacy also entails the need for confidentiality between the patient and the healthcare professional. Medical confidentiality is essential, but it is not absolute. The patient needs to reveal certain secrets to the healthcare professional, in confidence, for the purpose of care. In certain circumstances, e.g. in order to share information with other care professionals if needed for the treatment or care of the patient, the healthcare professional will also have to breach the principle of confidentiality. Data protection is crucial in times where information technologies are becoming increasingly important. Data protection aims at protecting the health information once it is collected. A series of principles were enshrined in legal binding texts with the objective of protecting the individual\u2019s data. The concepts of i) privacy, ii) medical confidentiality, iii) data protection are examined in their application within the SAFECARE context, while considering both national and European measures, as relevant.\n\n2) The second dimension relates to the protection of critical infrastructures (CI) and critical information infrastructures (CIIP) within the healthcare sector. Because of the \u2018criticality\u2019 of such infrastructures, and because of their interdependency, it is essential that these are protected. The analysis of the legal framework of CIP and CIIP in this deliverable proposes an overview of the European relevant acts and regulations (including European Critical Infrastructure Directive and the NIS Directive) as well as a glance to national legislations, namely France, the Netherlands and Italy.\n\n3) The third dimension relates to the ethical use of technologies in the healthcare sector. Next to legal requirements, ethical considerations can support the protection of individuals and the public health as they provide guidelines and can impose constraints on the development and application of technologies. Ethical concepts can build a basis for the law but they can also provide guidance in addition to what the law seems to require. This is sometimes necessary as the current legislation faces its difficulties to cope with upcoming legal issues due to the rapid evolution of information technologies. One concrete example is the collection of large data sets, or so-called big data, which seems to conflict with fundamental data protection principles, i.e. data minimisation. Reflecting on ethics allows to think beyond the law, and re-consider the implications for the healthcare sector, especially for the patient, the healthcare professional, and society.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61561004, "asset_id": 41362880, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31036421, "first_name": "Elisabetta", "last_name": "Biasin", "domain_name": "kuleuven", "page_name": "ElisabettaBiasin", "display_name": "Elisabetta Biasin", "profile_url": "https://kuleuven.academia.edu/ElisabettaBiasin?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31036421/35378105/30711870/s65_elisabetta.biasin.jpg"}, {"id": 11821941, "first_name": "Erik", "last_name": "Kamenja\u0161evi\u0107", "domain_name": "uniri", "page_name": "ErikKamenja\u0161evi\u0107", "display_name": "Erik Kamenja\u0161evi\u0107", "profile_url": "https://uniri.academia.edu/ErikKamenja%C5%A1evi%C4%87?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11821941/3785438/4431058/s65_erik.kamenja_evi_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2783, "name": "Privacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Privacy?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29393, "name": "Healthcare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Healthcare?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 81556, "name": "Critical infrastructure protection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_infrastructure_protection?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 196193, "name": "Confidentiality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Confidentiality?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 243726, "name": "Critical Information Infrastructure Protection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Information_Infrastructure_Protection?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 810094, "name": "CIIP", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/CIIP?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 38429847, "title": "The Significance of Mongolias Foreign Policy and Security Appara", "created_at": "2019-02-24T09:08:51.361-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38429847/The_Significance_of_Mongolias_Foreign_Policy_and_Security_Appara?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_38429847", "summary": "Mongolia, land-locked between two politically, economically, and militarily powerful nations \u2014Russia and China \u2014 often must balance its foreign and security policies with its two neighbors and countries beyond. When discussing Mongolia\u2019s foreign policy and security apparatus, historians and scholars look at the international relations of East Asia as a whole. This is the case not because Mongolia\u2019s foreign policy is insignificant but because greater powers impose greater influence on smaller states. Mongolia\u2019s partial involvement in World War II (WWII), and the Cold War introduced new challenges as well as opportunities for Mongolia to modernize its foreign\npolicy principles and security policies. In turn, this research paper offers ways to enhance and strengthen Mongolia\u2019s foreign and security policies by carefully looking at historical turning points, addressing existing issues, and providing a solution-based analysis for policymakers. Moreover, while there is a burgeoning discussion on cybersecurity, as a non-traditional security threat, Mongolia\u2019s cybersecurity apparatus is a new contribution to the existing literature. The research essay concludes that Mongolia\u2019s foreign and security policies are effective, timely efficient in facing both the traditional and non-traditional threats.\n\nKeywords\nMongolia,

These activities, ranging from attempts at espionage to coercion, in all appearance appears to confirm the domain\u2019s increasing strategic value. But upon closer inspection, only half of these have resulted in meeting their political objectives. Moreover, these have involved notable regional powers employing relatively unsophisticated tools and tactics in cyberspace. This challenges the prevailing notion that cyberspace provides an asymmetric advantage for middling and/or weak powers due to its low cost of entry and the increasing technological dependence of targets. With growing tensions in the Asia-Pacific, the need to better understand the strategic utilization of this domain is paramount. In so doing, this paper argues that coercive success in cyberspace is not determined solely by an aggressor\u2019s technological prowess but depends crucially on appropriate force employment and an understanding of the domain\u2019s unique geography. Through the analysis of the Stuxnet operation, the paper demonstrates that careful consideration of these factors may better account for the success or failure of coercion in the domain.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51787049, "asset_id": 31422168, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2799585, "first_name": "Miguel Alberto", "last_name": "Gomez", "domain_name": "ethz", "page_name": "MiguelAlbertoGomez", "display_name": "Miguel Alberto Gomez", "profile_url": "https://ethz.academia.edu/MiguelAlbertoGomez?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2799585/916278/17801223/s65_miguel_alberto.gomez.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 349502, "name": "Coercion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coercion?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 512183, "name": "Deterrence Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deterrence_Theory?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 30336424, "title": "End User Security Issues", "created_at": "2016-12-08T12:40:33.963-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30336424/End_User_Security_Issues?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_30336424", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50789976, "asset_id": 30336424, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6087149, "first_name": "Alexander", "last_name": "Schraut", "domain_name": "apus", "page_name": "AlexanderSchraut", "display_name": "Alexander Schraut", "profile_url": "https://apus.academia.edu/AlexanderSchraut?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6087149/2721470/3169487/s65_alexander.schraut.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 25391841, "title": "Onlinespiele -Ein kritisches Spielfeld f\u00fcr Kinder und Erwachsene?

However, this process is being challenged by the inherent complexity of systems, developed with vulnerable components and protocols, and the crescent sophistication of attackers, now backed by well-resourced criminal organizations and nations. With this scenario of uncertainties and high volume of events, it is essential the ability of cyber resiliency. Cyber resiliency is the ability of a system, organization, mission, or business process to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt capabilities in the face of adversary conditions, stresses, or attacks on the cyber resources it needs to function. In the present work, it is presented a framework for cyber resiliency where a segmentation strategy and the Intrusion Kill Chain (IKC) attack model, developed by Lockheed-Martin, are central elements. Segmentation allows the construction of a layered defense, where the highest-priority assets are in the inner layers and the attackers are forced to surpass several layers to reach them. The IKC attack model is a model of seven phases that the attackers must perform to achieve their goals. Each segment is supposed to be designed with the best efforts to prevent, detect and contain an IKC. According to the Situational Awareness (SA) model of Endsley, the Level of Perception is achieved through sensors connected to the controls of prevention, detection and containment of IKC in different segments. The Level of Understanding is obtained by identifying the segments impacted by the attackers, and the Level of Projection by the identification of the next segments to be attacked and defense actions required to contain this advance. The use of the framework leads to the development of a structured set of defense mechanisms, and supports the development of SA capability to allow defenders to make correct decisions in order to maintain the mission even under a heavy attack.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38020731, "asset_id": 13346136, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 16380240, "first_name": "Per", "last_name": "Gustavsson", "domain_name": "gmu", "page_name": "PerGustavsson", "display_name": "Per Gustavsson", "profile_url": "https://gmu.academia.edu/PerGustavsson?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/16380240/4454196/5162847/s65_per.gustavsson.jpg"}, {"id": 950881, "first_name": "Rose-Mharie", "last_name": "\u00c5hlfeldt", "domain_name": "his", "page_name": "RoseMharie\u00c5hlfeldt", "display_name": "Rose-Mharie \u00c5hlfeldt", "profile_url": "https://his.academia.edu/RoseMharie%C3%85hlfeldt?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/950881/20323024/20017848/s65_rose-mharie._hlfeldt.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2627, "name": "Situation awareness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Situation_awareness?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 142317, "name": "SITUATIONAL AWARENESS", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/SITUATIONAL_AWARENESS?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 199376, "name": "Cyber Security Incident Response", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security_Incident_Response?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 11343439, "title": "Cyber Terrorism di Indonesia", "created_at": "2015-03-09T14:29:46.348-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11343439/Cyber_Terrorism_di_Indonesia?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_11343439", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36915159, "asset_id": 11343439, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 27517250, "first_name": "Brata", "last_name": "Adisurya", "domain_name": "president", "page_name": "BrataAdisurya", "display_name": "Brata Adisurya", "profile_url": "https://president.academia.edu/BrataAdisurya?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/27517250/7832210/26537871/s65_brata.adisurya.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 982, "name": "Cyberlaw", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberlaw?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2511, "name": "Cybercrimes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrimes?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 125639, "name": "Terorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Terorism?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 507763, "name": "Terorisme", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Terorisme?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 67166905, "title": "Performance of Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics Paradigms in Cybersecurity and Cloud Computing Platforms", "created_at": "2022-01-04T21:38:32.296-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/67166905/Performance_of_Machine_Learning_and_Big_Data_Analytics_Paradigms_in_Cybersecurity_and_Cloud_Computing_Platforms?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_67166905", "summary": "The purpose of the research is to evaluate Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics paradigms for use in Cybersecurity.

The main legal issues will be presented, with a focus on intellectual property, consumer protection, and privacy. India and the United Kingdom are selected because they are at the forefront of the IoT innovation in their respective countries. The IoT is an expanding and heterogeneous universe encompassing all Things which are capable of connectivity and are equipped with sensing and actuating capabilities. One can find Things in very diverse sectors, from agriculture to manufacturing, retail, healthcare, leisure, domotics, urban development, etc. Therefore, not only is providing an exhaustive and static definition of the IoT nearly impossible (or at least pointless), but also the endeavour of providing a complete picture of the phenomenon would be a cumbersome path towards failure. Consequently, I will give account only of the highlights of the IoT in India and the United Kingdom. In India, the IoT will be analysed through the prism of net neutrality, smart cities, manufacturing, computer-related inventions, and a recent bill on the surveillance aspects of the world\u2019s largest biometric database (Aadhaar). In turn, I will look at the British context by analysing some (quasi) regulatory acts with a focus on privacy and consumer protection. One last caveat. When it comes to new technologies, one tends to be either \u2018apocalyptic\u2019 or \u2018integrated\u2019. Either the technology will save us all by leveraging a revolution leading to a disruptive innovation, or it will destroy our lives and the world will go to the dogs. I take a middle position and believe that through education, collective awareness, and soft law, one will be able to keep the human being at the centre of innovation, to unite people rather than divide them, to empower them and alleviate discrimination and poverty. What is important is neither should one delegate to technology nor to rely entirely on government: if the IoT is to actually become a revolution, it will do so due to the commitment of each and every one of us who will contribute to create the Internet of Citizens.\n\nPLEASE CITE AS: Guido NOTO LA DIEGA, The Internet of Citizens.

NIST started the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) as a conference and expo in 2010. NICE was to bring together industry, government, academia, and non-profit organizations to address the U.S.\u2019s cybersecurity education, training, and workforce needs (Petersen, 2019). The NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework\u2019s initial authors intended it to be a reference source for cybersecurity worker development, planning, training, and education (Newhouse, Keith, Scribner, & Witt, 2017). It was 2017 when NICE published the Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. This document provided an extensive list of technical KSAs, but not non-technical ones. At the same time, private industry started to discover the need for non-technical KSAs in their cybersecurity and other highly specialized workers. Tripwire, the security and compliance solutions provider, commissioned a survey asking 315 security professionals from over 100 US-based companies about the cybersecurity skills gap. Every participant indicated that soft skills were critical (Lapena, 2017). The report commented that the need for soft skills had increased to the point where employers were willing to hire people who were strong in these areas even if they had no security expertise. In their 2020 survey update, Tripwire noted that company security teams would be looking for some outside help to address the skills gap due to the continued strain on their teams because of the skills gap (Lapena, 2020). Despite increased data indicating the need for cybersecurity workers to master various non-technical knowledge skills and abilities, the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework does not have them listed for technical roles and may not help produce the type of worker that U.S. companies need as a result (Newhouse, Keith, Scribner, & Witt, 2017). The purpose of this study is to connect with cybersecurity practitioners about the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework to explore which non-technical knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) should the NICE Working Group consider.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65375537, "asset_id": 44864532, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 129172539, "first_name": "Dr. Lori", "last_name": "Sussman", "domain_name": "maine", "page_name": "LoriSussman", "display_name": "Dr. Lori Sussman", "profile_url": "https://maine.academia.edu/LoriSussman?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://gravatar.com/avatar/9dc0eb77076627d983ea8010ea8505f3?s=65"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2621, "name": "Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Higher_Education?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 188417, "name": "Information security awareness, training and education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_security_awareness_training_and_education?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 243636, "name": "NICE", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/NICE?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1744312, "name": "Cybersecurity Training", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity_Training?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1996380, "name": "Cybersecurity Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity_Education?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 42202351, "title": "Mobile application security: Role of perceived privacy as the predictor of security perceptions", "created_at": "2020-03-12T08:36:39.063-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42202351/Mobile_application_security_Role_of_perceived_privacy_as_the_predictor_of_security_perceptions?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_42202351", "summary": "Despite mobile applications being at the frontier of mobile computation technologies, security issues pose a threat to their adoption and diffusion. Recent studies suggest that security violations could be mitigated through improved security behaviors and attitudes, not just through better technologies. Existing literature on behavioral security suggests that one of the main predictors of users' perceptions of security is their perceived privacy concerns. Using communication privacy management theory (CPM), this study examines the effects of privacy-related perceptions, such as privacy risk and the effectiveness of privacy policies, on the security perceptions of mobile app users. To empirically test the proposed theoretical model, two survey studies were conducted using mobile apps requesting less sensitive information (n = 487) and more sensitive information (n = 559). The findings show that the perceived privacy risk negatively influences the perceived security of the mobile apps; the perceived effectiveness of a privacy policy positively influences user perceptions of mobile app security; and perceived privacy awareness moderates the effect of perceived privacy risk on the perceived security of mobile apps. The results also suggest that users have different privacy-security perceptions based on the information sensitivity of the mobile apps.

The high speed and accessibility of its cyber infrastructure has also made it one of the most wired countries in the world. However despite these technological achievements, the nation has been the victim of many major cyber attacks. Perhaps most curious, is the lack of diversity and sophistication in the types of operating, browsing, and security software in use, which has left South Korea more vulnerable to cyber incursions. This paper analyzes this phenomenon, and uses primary quantitative data collected from South Korean end-users to measure the diversity of such software and its relation to national cybersecurity policies. The author concludes that the existence of such software uniformity is supported by the data, and that its origins can be traced to the country's national public key infrastructure as well as its requirement of outdated security protocols.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51518774, "asset_id": 31084316, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3783196, "first_name": "Gus", "last_name": "Swanda", "domain_name": "independentresearcher", "page_name": "GusSwanda", "display_name": "Gus Swanda", "profile_url": "https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/GusSwanda?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3783196/3827781/16102745/s65_gus.swanda.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 982, "name": "Cyberlaw", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberlaw?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13923, "name": "Computer Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 28471869, "title": "India\u2019s Cyber Security Conference Proceeding of Ground Zero Summit 2014", "created_at": "2016-09-14T00:37:28.455-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28471869/India_s_Cyber_Security_Conference_Proceeding_of_Ground_Zero_Summit_2014?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_28471869", "summary": "There is near no literature available about India\u2019s cyber security activities.

Convention on International Information Security\u201d was released at an \u201cinternational meeting of high-ranking officials responsible for security matters\u201d in Yekaterinburg, Russia. \n\nThis commentary, produced jointly by the Institute of Information Security Issues (IISI) of Moscow State University and Conflict Studies Research Centre, an independent research group based in the UK, seeks to explain key provisions of the draft Convention \nand the reasoning behind them \u2013 particularly in those areas where this reasoning may be at odds with the Western consensus on basic concepts of internet security. \n\nThe key provisions of the document have been condensed into a list of 23 fundamental issues of concern to Russia in information space by IISI, whose staff members were closely engaged in developing the draft Convention. Of these 23, 20 have been used by IISI in the text of this commentary to group concepts and ideas expressed in the draft. \n\nPart I of this document comprises a parallel commentary on each of these principles, and the citations from the draft which embody them, by both IISI and CSRC. Part II consists of additional commentary by CSRC on specific sections of the draft which are \nnot explicitly referenced in Part I; this is because CSRC identified many more points of contention and possible disagreement in the document than are explicitly listed by the Russian commentary. Finally, two appendices cover translation and linguistic issues in \nthe draft, and potential scope for confidence and security building measures based on the text. \n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 15732766, "asset_id": 1611951, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1013645, "first_name": "Susan", "last_name": "de N\u00eemes", "domain_name": "conflictstudies", "page_name": "SusandeN\u00eemes", "display_name": "Susan de N\u00eemes", "profile_url": "https://conflictstudies.academia.edu/SusandeN%C3%AEmes?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 189, "name": "Criminology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminology?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 389, "name": "Russian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian_Studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 814, "name": "Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 902, "name": "Philosophy Of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_Of_Religion?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 982, "name": "Cyberlaw", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberlaw?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1660, "name": "Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Terrorism?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2575, "name": "International Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 3705, "name": "International Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 6728, "name": "Philosophy Of Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_Of_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 7057, "name": "Cyberstudies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberstudies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 7669, "name": "Russian Foreign Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian_Foreign_Policy?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 9544, "name": "Internet Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 9642, "name": "Cyberjournalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberjournalism?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 13923, "name": "Computer Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 16542, "name": "Cryptography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cryptography?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 23506, "name": "Information Security and Privacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security_and_Privacy?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 31758, "name": "Economic Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 41234, "name": "Administrative Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Administrative_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 61620, "name": "National Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 67525, "name": "Existentialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Existentialism?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 83779, "name": "Rules of War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rules_of_War?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 72515559, "title": "A critical review of intrusion detection systems in the internet of things: techniques, deployment strategy, validation strategy, attacks, public datasets and challenges", "created_at": "2022-02-26T14:35:26.529-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/72515559/A_critical_review_of_intrusion_detection_systems_in_the_internet_of_things_techniques_deployment_strategy_validation_strategy_attacks_public_datasets_and_challenges?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_72515559", "summary": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has been rapidly evolving towards making a greater impact on everyday life to large industrial systems.

A worldwide network of banks, electronic wallets, cryptocurrencies, mobile payment platforms, and numerous third-party payment services has made the transfer of money and funds easier and more accessible than ever before. But with that convenience comes a price. Service providers decreasingly have a face-to-face relationship with the users of their platforms because transactions can be made anywhere in the world, across massive geographic borders, at any time of day. Moreover, some services can be used anonymously. The proliferation of these technologies has thus been a boon for criminals, allowing them to launder money with the same ease that legitimate users of a service enjoy.\n\nNot, however, to suggest that this is the whole picture. The increasing sophistication of software and networks also affords law enforcement a wider array of means to detect the flow of illicit funds and so combat cyberlaundering. Nevertheless, the fight against cybercrime, including laundering, is an uphill battle. New technology brings advantages and risks in itself\u2014\nand contingent vulnerabilities. As elaborate networks and systems obtain, so too grows the number of variables that institutions and law enforcement must monitor. Services can themselves be misused, which is a risk that all services providers try to account for, but the very availability of numerous platforms compounds the intricacy of cyberlaundering operations.

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of all the techniques along with the pros and cons of each method.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61774673, "asset_id": 41618586, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5317094, "first_name": "Rejo", "last_name": "Mathew", "domain_name": "nmims", "page_name": "RejoMathew", "display_name": "Rejo Mathew", "profile_url": "https://nmims.academia.edu/RejoMathew?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5317094/2336529/2724776/s65_rejo.mathew.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2345, "name": "Wireless Communications", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wireless_Communications?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 369308, "name": "GNSS and GPS", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/GNSS_and_GPS?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35668819, "title": "Clickbait: Fake News and Role of the State", "created_at": "2018-01-14T23:21:01.435-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35668819/Clickbait_Fake_News_and_Role_of_the_State?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_35668819", "summary": "States all around the world are seeking to restrict the proliferation of \u2018fake news\u2019 to insulate their populations against messages that may destabilise their societies.

Boundaries between spaces are becoming blurred in the evolving information age. New and diverse actors have entered the stage, decentralized soft power structures have gained in importance, and the state's monopoly on authority has become fragmented. But do information and communication technologies networks really lead to a weakening of the nation-state? The common inclination of this volume is to revisit the \"retreat of the state\" thesis and test its validity in the 21st century's structures and practices of governance. It contends that cyberspace is a matter of collective and policy choice. Consequently, cyberspace becomes prone to usurpation by governance structures; governments all around the world are already reacting to the information revolution and trying to re-establish their leading role in creating the governance regimes for the Information Age. This volume comes at a historical moment when new political dynamics are detected and new conceptual models are sought to categorize the attempts to deal with global/transnational issues.\n\nThe book will intrigue the reader with the expert-level analysis of the role of the state in the emerging global/supranational governance structures and processes by providing the proper historical context and conceptualizing trends and social dynamics.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 26493562, "asset_id": 462499, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 350006, "first_name": "Myriam", "last_name": "Dunn Cavelty", "domain_name": "ethz", "page_name": "MyriamCavelty", "display_name": "Myriam Dunn Cavelty", "profile_url": "https://ethz.academia.edu/MyriamCavelty?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/350006/94486/302631/s65_myriam.dunn_cavelty.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 491, "name": "Information Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Technology?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2099, "name": "Information Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Society?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5167, "name": "Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Governance?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7822, "name": "Internet Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_Governance?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10058, "name": "Cyberspace Regulation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace_Regulation?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 101074, "name": "Nation-State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nation-State?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 1471717, "title": "The militarisation of cyber security as a source of global tension", "created_at": "2012-03-12T23:41:27.974-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1471717/The_militarisation_of_cyber_security_as_a_source_of_global_tension?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_1471717", "summary": "Cyber security is seen as one of the most pressing national security issues of our time.

However, they are always in need of the most available computing resources, such as central processing unit (CPU) and random-access memory (RAM), so they normally hack and hook computers into a botnet. This may allow them to perform dangerous distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and perform brute force cracking algorithms, which are highly CPU intensive. They may also use the zombie or drone systems they have hacked to hide their location on the net and gain anonymity by bouncing off around them many times a minute. Phishing allows them to gain their stretch of compromised systems to increase their power. For a normal hacker without the money to invest in sophisticated techniques, exploiting the human factor, which is the weakest link to security, comes in handy. The possibility of successfully manipulating the human into releasing the security that they set up makes the life of the hacker very easy, because they do not have to try to break into the system with force, rather the owner will just open the door for them. The objective of the research is to review factors that enhance phishing and improve the probability of its success. We have discovered that hackers rely on triggering the emotional effects of their victims through their phishing attacks. We have applied the use of artificial intelligence to be able to detect the emotion associated with a phrase or sentence. Our model had a good accuracy which could be improved with the use of a larger dataset with more emotional sentiments for various phrases and sentences. Our technique may be used to check for emotional manipulation in suspicious emails to improve the confidence interval of suspected phishing emails.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 75444918, "asset_id": 62786327, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 126184001, "first_name": "Robert", "last_name": "Karamagi", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RKaramagi", "display_name": "Robert Karamagi", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RKaramagi?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/126184001/35130128/37907803/s65_robert.karamagi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2008, "name": "Machine Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Machine_Learning?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 148827, "name": "Emotion Detection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotion_Detection?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 315622, "name": "Phishing Attacks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phishing_Attacks?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 49554099, "title": "A NATO kiberv\u00e9delmi szakpolitik\u00e1ja", "created_at": "2021-07-05T07:11:15.721-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49554099/A_NATO_kiberv%C3%A9delmi_szakpolitik%C3%A1ja?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_49554099", "summary": "A k\u00f6zv\u00e9lem\u00e9ny ma m\u00e1r heti rendszeress\u00e9ggel szembes\u00fcl olyan h\u00edrekkel, amelyekben orsz\u00e1gok \u00e1ltal elk\u00f6vetett kibert\u00e1mad\u00e1sokat mutatnak be.

Of the many technological fantasies that were once just an entertaining concept in literature, the self-driving car has become a part of many individuals\u2019 lives and will only affect more in the coming years. With the advent of the autonomous vehicle, there are surely legal complications that arise from the paradigmatic shift in transportation. Many laws which were drafted years ago may not stand the test of time and will undoubtedly need to be revisited. The primary threat to the operators of autonomous vehicles may not necessarily be that of other drivers, but the malicious individuals who intend to exploit the vehicle\u2019s autonomous function to wreak havoc. Cybersecurity is an important concern in autonomous vehicles, and proper consideration needs to be given to the way governments legislate and regulate the industry. The world has become a connected place, and it has been done so through technological advancements. This interconnectivity may prove to be one of the greatest improvements to our lives, but at what cost? Increased connectivity means increased vulnerability of the car and in the event the vehicle does get into an accident due to a cybersecurity breach, the allotment of liability will not be as straightforward as it was prior to the automation function. There has been much academic commentary on the liability of parties involved with autonomous vehicles, but none have focused on the liability of cybersecurity breaches nor the effect cybersecurity has in regulatory and legislative matters. The discussion of cybersecurity needs to be a focus both in the parliament and within the industry. Not enough emphasis has been put on this, and this could lead to devastating consequences. Furthermore, as Autonomous Vehicles develop, the overarching goal of harmonisation of legislation needs the support of all jurisdictions. Different approaches yield different solutions to the problem, and it is from these differences that jurisdictions may find the solutions that fill their legislative or regulatory gaps. Through an inter-jurisdictional approach, this paper will provide an analysis into the influence cybersecurity has on autonomous vehicle legislation and regulation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64041850, "asset_id": 43732034, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8286064, "first_name": "Ryan", "last_name": "Wong", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RyanWong4", "display_name": "Ryan Wong", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RyanWong4?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8286064/17372286/35816076/s65_ryan.wong.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3838, "name": "Insurance Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Insurance_Law?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11035, "name": "Regulation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Regulation?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 88815, "name": "Legislation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Legislation?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 204921, "name": "Autonomous driving", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Autonomous_driving?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 376394, "name": "Liability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liability?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 43011226, "title": "SICUREZZA INFORMATICA: la gestione del rischio informatico e la risoluzione degli incidenti", "created_at": "2020-05-11T11:21:27.034-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43011226/SICUREZZA_INFORMATICA_la_gestione_del_rischio_informatico_e_la_risoluzione_degli_incidenti?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_43011226", "summary": "In questa presentazione \u00e8 trattato l'argomento della resilienza informatica.

Today, the question is no longer whether, but how cyberspace should be governed in order to ensure cybersecurity around the world. It is in this context that international lawyers have also begun wrestling with the question of how they might contribute to the security and stability of cyberspace.\n\nAgainst this background, this paper seeks to map the different modalities by which international lawyers have attempted to promote and preserve cybersecurity to date. The paper begins by identifying two of the most common modalities of engagement: first, as law-articulators, international lawyers have sought to identify the extent to which existing international legal frameworks already apply to cyber activities; and second, as law-entrepreneurs, international lawyers have sought to devise new international rules to respond to the unique challenges posed by cybersecurity. Bearing in mind the limits of these forms of engagement, the post identifies the emergence of a third modality: as norm-articulators and norm-entrepreneurs, international lawyers are beginning to broaden their perspective beyond international cyber law towards a concern for global cyber norms.\n\nUltimately, the paper aims to shed light on the politics of these different modalities of engagement \u2013 where \u201cpolitics\u201d is understood to refer to the choices confronted by international lawyers in their attempts to respond to perceived problems of the world with a view to managing them. In this vein, the paper seeks to offer a clear illustration of how the engagement of international lawyers in a particular context constitutes an expression of the political.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53447942, "asset_id": 33392299, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4122371, "first_name": "Barrie", "last_name": "Sander", "domain_name": "leidenuni", "page_name": "BarrieSander", "display_name": "Barrie Sander", "profile_url": "https://leidenuni.academia.edu/BarrieSander?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4122371/1596879/16504015/s65_barrie.sander.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2575, "name": "International Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Law?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6357, "name": "Law and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_and_Politics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7560, "name": "Public International Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_International_Law?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 31084189, "title": "The Deficiencies of a Westphalian Model for Cyberspace: A Case Study of South Korean Cyber Security", "created_at": "2017-01-26T07:26:40.387-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31084189/The_Deficiencies_of_a_Westphalian_Model_for_Cyberspace_A_Case_Study_of_South_Korean_Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_31084189", "summary": "Viewing contemporary attempts of technologically advanced countries to restrict outsider access to critical websites and infrastructure through the lens of the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, there has been significantly more credence given to the idea that nation-states are moving towards creating an infrastructure for national cyber borders. If successful, however, such a model would create new economic, social and technical problems that may pose greater threats to national security. This paper explains the drawbacks of the cyber-Westphalian model using South Korean cyber policy as a case study, and highlights the potential dangers of restricting the internet at the national level. Through data collected from South Korean computer users and secondary sources, the author finds that the implementation of national borders in cyberspace is not feasible. In addition, such a model would bring with it severe detriments to the online economy and personal freedoms, while still leaving vital systems vulnerable. Cyberspace has become the central nervous system of nations' communications , government and commercial operations, infrastructure and security. As the internet grew in scale, so too did the dependence on cyberspace and vulnerability to cyberattack. The fear that a person, group or rival state could inflict catastrophic damage to a nation through the internet has put national cybersecurity at the forefront of", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51518640, "asset_id": 31084189, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3783196, "first_name": "Gus", "last_name": "Swanda", "domain_name": "independentresearcher", "page_name": "GusSwanda", "display_name": "Gus Swanda", "profile_url": "https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/GusSwanda?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3783196/3827781/16102745/s65_gus.swanda.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4179, "name": "South Korea", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Korea?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 61620, "name": "National Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 86814, "name": "National Security, International Relations Theory, Political Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Security_International_Relations_Theory_Political_Philosophy?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 30915281, "title": "Machine rules.

Therefore, the Italian approach may constitute a model for many regulations to come; nonetheless, the legal literature seems to overlook the phenomenon. In this article, I place the discourse on drones in the context of some more general considerations on the main legal issues related to the deployment of machines, including robots, in our everyday life. Indeed, most considerations apply equally to robots and drones, moving from the unrefined, albeit practical, observation that the latter are robots equipped with wings. An analysis of the intellectual property, data protection, privacy, and liability issues is carried out bearing in mind the complexity arising from the increasing implementation of cloud computing and artificial intelligence technologies. The article claims that autonomous machines will outclass human beings in all their tasks, but the horror vacui ought to be avoided: a new unforeseeable society will come.

"work_23736395", "summary": "It is a strange thing to contemplate how the world seems to obsess on everything \u2018new\u2019 while supposedly always remaining true to \u2018old\u2019 strategies, ideals, and approaches. This is most certainly the case in the world of conflict and cooperation: for every new invention or arrival of a new epoch the 21st century is supposed to bring us, we never seem far removed from thinking that has always gotten us into trouble as a species. This issue of the Greater Caspian Project looks at a broad array of cases that illustrate this phenomenon. We consider innovative ways to look at the aftermath of the JCPOA, at Arctic exploration, and new Russian foreign policy thinking. We dive into larger problems that extend deep into the Middle East and clearly impact the European Union and United States. In each instance we begin with an assumed supposition by the global community that these challenges are somehow new and novel and unique. And in each case our analyses break down how even novelty can still be subsumed by old biases and long-standing prejudices. \n\nThis can be very disheartening for an organization like Modern Diplomacy, the parent of the Greater Caspian Project, so interested in seeing new connections and pathways develop for the interests of greater, broader, and deeper peace and understanding. Unfortunately, as this issue will show our readers, old habits die hard: diplomacy is not always for cooperation; exploration is not always for more opportunity for all; engagement is not always altruistic. One thing all of us affiliated with the Project continue to hope for, even if it is a small hope indeed, is that even when things look bleak or our optimism in the human agents conducting global affairs dims considerably, the effort to continue to expose our readers to knowledge, to new perspectives and outlooks, will shine a brighter light and construct newer pathways that seemed impossible before. Otherwise, to analyze the ways of war and peace, of life and death, would be a hopelessly depressing venture. So here is to No. 22 and to all of our readers: shine the light of analysis and knowledge into the darkest and dimmest corners. The world needs it. The world needs you. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44172281, "asset_id": 23736395, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6901110, "first_name":

Existing literature lacks information on whether municipalities have implemented cybersecurity policies, if such policies are applied in practice and what they encompass. A CAWI method was used to collect the required data. The results indicate that while most municipalities have a document defining their security policy, they do not always apply it in practice. There is still little awareness regarding countering cyberattacks. Therefore, more emphasis should be placed on such issues as: integrating cybersecurity policies into local government management, the rising threat of cyber-attacks, consultations with security auditors, and cybersecurity management training.

The paper discusses the origin, purpose and characteristics of a capability maturity model and its adoption in the cybersecurity domain. Driven by a thematic analysis under the document analysis methodology , the paper examines existing globally recognized cybersecurity capability maturity models and Qatar's cybersecurity framework using publicly available documents. This paper also conducts a comparative analysis of existing cybersecurity capability maturity models in light of the Qatari cybersecurity framework, including a comparative analysis of cyber-security capability maturity model literature. The comparative document analysis helped identify gaps in the existing Qatar National Information Assurance Policy and specifically the Qatar National Information Assurance Manual. The proposed Q-C2M2 aims to enhance Qa-tar's cybersecurity framework by providing a workable Q-C2M2 with a legislative component that can be used to benchmark, measure and develop Qatar's cybersecurity framework. The Q-C2M2 proposes the USERS domains consisting of Understand, Secure, Expose, Recover and Sustain. Each domain consists of subdomains, under which an organization can create cybersecurity activities at initial benchmarking.

The sharp increase in attack surfaces can be partially attributed to the fact that Internet becomes the de facto means of converged communications and online transactions accommodating different types of services under the same scheme. Most current intrusion detection systems (IDS) deploy signature patterns of known attacks and anomaly detection approaches in detecting intrusions in an attempt to reduce the computational complexity introduced by large scale data sets. However, these approaches have been proved to be inadequate to detect novel attacks often resulting in a high false positive rate. This research will therefore seek to address the issue of detecting persistent network threats by combining the approaches of misuse and anomaly detection in one system. Our algorithm incorporates the concept of active response against all four broad attack types analyzed in the literature to realize another algorithm for intrusion detection and prevention as well as active response called HYBRITQ-4. The algorithm introduces a mechanism for classifying packets based on protocol information to enhance pattern searches and matching when detecting abnormal packets. Findings from our investigation suggest that the proposed algorithm can efficiently improve the detection rate, false positive rate and accuracy of detecting intrusions in patterns of known and novel attacks.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59092560, "asset_id": 38986254, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 111117805, "first_name": "Ayei", "last_name": "Ibor", "domain_name": "unicaledu", "page_name": "AyeiIbor", "display_name": "Ayei Ibor", "profile_url": "https://unicaledu.academia.edu/AyeiIbor?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/111117805/26267966/24860751/s65_ayei.ibor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 465, "name": "Artificial Intelligence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Artificial_Intelligence?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2008, "name": "Machine Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Machine_Learning?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16542, "name": "Cryptography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cryptography?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53292, "name": "Programming", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Programming?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 56050, "name": "Ethical Hacking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethical_Hacking?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 81182, "name": "Deep Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deep_Learning?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 305303, "name": "Vulnerability assessment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vulnerability_assessment?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 36616160, "title": "Dependent Reliability of Distributed Cloud Computing Network (DCCN)", "created_at": "2018-05-12T04:12:10.345-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36616160/Dependent_Reliability_of_Distributed_Cloud_Computing_Network_DCCN_?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_36616160", "summary": "To achieve reliability, scalability, fault tolerance, and high network capacity for remote cloud application users, data center correlation failures must be prevented. Without system reliability of data center components and systems, an incremental traffic growth and high bandwidth requirements will constantly crash the system. In this paper, a new DCCN reliability ontology is presented for Non-recursive OpenFlow datacenter (NROD) network structure. The design exhibits acceptable performance enhancement with network component isolation and hazard function or failure rates. This behavior is of special significance for UNN shipping-container data centers, since once the container is encased and operational, troubleshooting or replacement of components becomes difficult. Using the ICT innovation center at the University of Nigeria-Nsukka, recursive BCube and DCell datacenters are identified and analyzed in the context of system reliability. Mathematical characterization on failure rate time curves/bathtub, reliability hazard function, failure rate modeling and mean time before failure (MTBF) are presented with respect to NROD proposal. Monte-Carlo sampling approach was employed in an experimental study with event scripts of Riverbed Modeller 17.5.

Applying comparative law, we proceed to assess whether and how different legal frameworks and traditions \u2013 such as civil law, common law, sharia law and socialist/communist law \u2013 affect judicial cooperation between territories and regional institutions. A distinction between the first-and second-generation institutions is also made, with the conclusion that the latter (as organizations focused on trade and economic issues) drive judicial cooperation more effectively due to their more neutral outlook and greater incentives for the member-states pursuing their national interests, to comply with the rules.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

the past decade, Africa has witnessed a phenomenal growth in Internet penetration and the use of Information Communications Technologies (ICTs). However, the spread of ICTs and Internet penetration has also raised concerns about cyber security at regional and sub-regional governance forums. This has led African intergovernmental organizations to develop legal frameworks for cyber security. At the sub-regional level, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has adopted a Directive on Cybercrime, while the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) have adopted model laws. At the regional level, the African Union (AU) has adopted a Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection. This paper seeks to examine these legal instruments with a view to determining whether they provide adequate frameworks for mutual assistance and international cooperation on cyber security and cyber crime control. The paper will argue that the AU Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection does not provide an adequate framework for mutual assistance and international cooperation amongst African States and that this state of affairs may limit and fragment international cooperation and mutual assistance along sub-regional lines or bilateral arrangements. It will recommend the development of international cooperation and mutual assistance mechanisms within the framework of the AU and also make a case for the establishment of a regional Computer Emergency Response Team to enhance cooperation as well as the coordination of responses to cyber security incidents.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45542423, "asset_id": 25235345, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 401658, "first_name": "Uchenna Jerome", "last_name": "Orji", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "UchennaJeromeOrji", "display_name": "Uchenna Jerome Orji", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/UchennaJeromeOrji?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 379, "name": "African Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 982, "name": "Cyberlaw", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberlaw?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2511, "name": "Cybercrimes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrimes?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3974, "name": "Telecommunications", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Telecommunications?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4527, "name": "Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Africa?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 12054, "name": "International Cooperation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Cooperation?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 13923, "name": "Computer Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 20594, "name": "Cyber crime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_crime?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 49396, "name": "African Union", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Union?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 60770, "name": "Law of Treaties", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_of_Treaties?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 161536, "name": "Sadc", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sadc?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 170376, "name": "International Treaties", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Treaties?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 283207, "name": "ECOWAS", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ECOWAS?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 24557113, "title": "Iran Facility Hacked", "created_at": "2016-04-19T07:58:54.385-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24557113/Iran_Facility_Hacked?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_24557113", "summary": "This research examines the impact of the infamous \" Stuxnet \" worm which affected the physical pistons within a secured Iranian Nuc Power Plant.

The purpose of this paper is to signify that cyberspace, in common with the other four domains (land, sea, air and outer space) and despite its unique characteristics, is just a reflection of the current international system, and thereby is largely affected by the rules that characterize it. The issue of state sovereignty in cyberspace is critical to any discussion about future regulation of cyberspace. Although cyberspace is borderless and is characterized by anonymity and ubiquity, recent state practices provide sufficient evidence that cyberspace, or at least some components of it, are not immune from sovereignty. The increasing use of Internet filtering techniques by both authoritarian regimes and democracies is just the latest example of attempting to control information flows. Cyberspace is non\u2010territorial, but in sharp contrast to the land, sea, air and outer space, cyberspace is not a part of nature, it is human\u2010made and therefore can be unmade and regulated. States have continuously emphasized their right to exercise control over the cyber\u2010infrastructure located in their respective territory, to exercise their jurisdiction over cyberactivities on their territory, and to protect their cyber\u2010infrastructure against any trans\u2010border interference by other states or by individuals. As a result, states are filtering and monitoring cyber\u2010bytes. Over the past years, there is a growing number of states that is publishing national cyber\u2010policies and establishing cyber\u2010centers that aim to protect the national cyber\u2010infrastructure and control their citizens\u2019 access to information. The issue of state sovereignty in cyberspace raises critical questions about the need to regulate the cyber domain and gradually reach an international cyber\u2010order.", "downloadable_attachments":

Due to sophisticated and highly publicised cyber attacks, it is increasingly framed as a strategic-military concern and many states have or at least want to acquire offensive cyber \u201cweapons\u201d. The aim of this paper is to show that particular ways of framing threats are not only a matter of choice but also come with political and social effects. Focusing on the strategic-military aspects of cyber security means subjecting it to the rules of an antagonistic zero-sum game, in which one party\u2019s gain is another party\u2019s loss. This invokes enemy images even though there is no identifiable enemy, centres too strongly on national security measures instead of economic and business solutions, and wrongly suggests that states can establish control over cyberspace. Not only does this create an unnecessary atmosphere of insecurity and tension in the international system, it is also based on misperceptions of the nature and level of cyber risk and on the feasibility of different protection measures in a world characterised by complex, interdependent risk. While it is undisputed that the cyber dimension will play a substantial role in future conflicts of all grades and shades, threat-representations must remain well informed and well balanced at all times in order to rule out policy (over-)reactions with too high costs and uncertain benefits.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 19464905, "asset_id": 1238508, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 350006, "first_name": "Myriam", "last_name": "Dunn Cavelty", "domain_name": "ethz", "page_name": "MyriamCavelty", "display_name": "Myriam Dunn Cavelty", "profile_url": "https://ethz.academia.edu/MyriamCavelty?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/350006/94486/302631/s65_myriam.dunn_cavelty.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3705, "name": "International Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5523, "name": "Security Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_Studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6831, "name": "Securitization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Securitization?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7057, "name": "Cyberstudies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberstudies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 19087, "name": "Military and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_and_Politics?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 44533120, "title": "INDIA'S FORTHCOMING NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY: Analysing the Past to Predict the Expected Outcome", "created_at": "2020-11-19T03:41:53.030-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44533120/INDIAS_FORTHCOMING_NATIONAL_CYBER_SECURITY_STRATEGY_Analysing_the_Past_to_Predict_the_Expected_Outcome?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_44533120", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64985882, "asset_id": 44533120, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3365740, "first_name": "Dr. E.", "last_name": "Dilipraj", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "EDilipraj", "display_name": "Dr. E.

A more accurate assessment of the security provision informs on the most vulnerable environments that necessitate more diligent management. The rapid proliferation in the automation of cyber-attacks is reducing the gap between information and operational technologies and the need to review the current levels of robustness against new sophisticated cyber-attacks, trends, technologies and mitigation countermeasures has become pressing. A deeper characterisation is also the basis with which to predict future vulnerabilities in turn guiding the most appropriate deployment technologies. Thus, refreshing established practices and the scope of the training to support the decision making of users and operators. The foundation of the training provision is the use of Cyber-Ranges (CRs) and Test-Beds (TBs), platforms/tools that help inculcate a deeper understanding of the evolution of an attack and the methodology to deploy the most impactful countermeasures to arrest breaches. In this paper, an evaluation of documented CR and TB platforms is evaluated. CRs and TBs are segmented by type, technology, threat scenarios, applications and the scope of attainable training. To enrich the analysis of documented CR and TB research and cap the study, a taxonomy is developed to provide a broader comprehension of the future of CRs and TBs.

In this article, we first examine AVs and different categories of the technological risks associated with adoption of fully autonomous vehicles. We then explore different types of strategies that can be adopted by governments to address these different types of technological risks introduced by AVs. We then explore various governance responses to these risks in different countries. Our analyses reveal that thus far, in most instances governments have avoided stringent measures with the aim of promoting AV developments. As AV developments are still in early stages, the majority of governance responses are non-binding and focused on creating councils or working groups to better explore the implications of AVs at this stage. United States has been active in introducing and enacting AV-specific legislations to address issues related to safety, liability, privacy, and cybersecurity. UK and Germany, in particular, have enacted laws to address liability issues while other countries mostly acknowledge these issues but have yet to implement specific strategies. To address privacy risks, data privacy laws not specific to AVs have been amended in some countries while other countries have decided to rely on existing laws or have made recommendations on privacy principles. Similarly, a wide range of strategies varying from introduction or amendment of non-AV specific legislation to creating working groups and funding research to better explore issues and make recommendations have been adopted.

Before we can adequately address the problem, we need to have a crystal clear understanding about cyber attacks from various perspectives. This is a challenge because the Internet is a large-scale complex system with humans in the loop. In this paper, we investigate a particular perspective of the problem, namely the extreme value phenomenon that is exhibited by cyber attack rates, which are the numbers of attacks against a system of interest per time unit. It is important to explore this perspective because understanding the statistical properties of extreme cyber attack rates will pave the way for cost-effective, if not optimal, allocation of resources in real-life cyber defense operations. Specifically, we propose modeling and predicting extreme cyber attack rates via marked point processes, while using the Value-at-Risk (VaR) as a natural measure of intense cyber attacks. The point processes are then applied to analyze some real datasets. Our analysis shows that the point processes can describe and predict extreme cyber attack rates at a very satisfactory accuracy.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50404502, "asset_id": 29947399, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 53241330, "first_name": "Shouhuai", "last_name": "Xu", "domain_name": "uccs", "page_name": "ShouhuaiXu", "display_name": "Shouhuai Xu", "profile_url": "https://uccs.academia.edu/ShouhuaiXu?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/53241330/67031758/55392684/s65_shouhuai.xu.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4205, "name": "Data Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_Analysis?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2531766, "name": "Cybersecurity Data Analytics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity_Data_Analytics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 19741679, "title": "Cybersecurity Issues on Web-Based Systems in Nigeria: M-Learning Case Study", "created_at": "2015-12-19T06:25:57.092-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19741679/Cybersecurity_Issues_on_Web_Based_Systems_in_Nigeria_M_Learning_Case_Study?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_19741679", "summary": "There is a rapid growth of the application of mobile devices as a learning aid especially in developing countries such as Nigeria largely due to affordability, interest and availability of mobile handheld devices.

Nonetheless, this scale is in practice more complex, in part due to the influence of the Sh...", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 53768286, "first_name": "Riccardo", "last_name": "Vecellio Segate", "domain_name": "bristol", "page_name": "RiccardoVecellioSegate", "display_name": "Riccardo Vecellio Segate", "profile_url": "https://bristol.academia.edu/RiccardoVecellioSegate?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/53768286/14185984/66206933/s65_riccardo.vecellio_segate.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7074, "name": "Internet Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_Law?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7560, "name": "Public International Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_International_Law?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7669, "name": "Russian Foreign Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian_Foreign_Policy?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 7822, "name": "Internet Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_Governance?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 10058, "name": "Cyberspace Regulation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace_Regulation?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 10370, "name": "East Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Asian_Politics?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 34292, "name": "Poststructuralist Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poststructuralist_Theory?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 41862, "name": "Cyberwarfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberwarfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 96546, "name": "Cyber Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 127385, "name": "Law and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_and_Technology?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 155966, "name": "Law and Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_and_Language?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 183140, "name": "ASEAN Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN_Studies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 467668, "name": "Cyberterrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberterrorism?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 965931, "name": "Shanghai Cooperation Organisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shanghai_Cooperation_Organisation?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1002114, "name": "CYBER ESPIONAGE", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/CYBER_ESPIONAGE?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2899136, "name": "Cyberattack", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberattack?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 69081746, "title": "Artificial Neural Network for Cybersecurity: A Comprehensive Review", "created_at": "2022-01-21T20:22:57.363-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/69081746/Artificial_Neural_Network_for_Cybersecurity_A_Comprehensive_Review?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_69081746", "summary": "Cybersecurity is a very emerging field that protects systems, networks, and data from digital attacks.

To help port policymakers develop cybersecurity measures, this study conceptualized and developed three dimensions of port cybersecurity hygiene (i.e. human, infrastructure, and procedure factors) and investigated the relationships between port cybersecurity hygiene and cyberthreats (i.e. hacktivism, cyber criminality, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism, and cyber war). A questionnaire survey was used to collect data from all international container port operators and shipping lines with branches in Thailand, and the proposed relationships were tested by structural equation modeling. The results indicated that container ports tended to encounter hacktivism when their human, infrastructure, and procedure factors were vulnerable. The weakness of the human factor could also lead to cyber terrorism, while the deficiency of the infrastructure factor could lead to cyber criminality. Moreover, container ports were likely to be harmed by cyber espionage if their procedure factor was poorly implemented. Hence, the provision of training and education to all port workers, including top executives, managers, and supervisors, are necessary to ensure a cyberthreat-awareness culture at all organizational levels. Improving cybersecurity equipment could prevent unauthorized access to port business data and keep important information secure, while the ISPS Code-based procedures and other preventive measures should be strictly implemented by container ports to reduce the risk of cyberthreats.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63714476, "asset_id": 43413840, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3665350, "first_name": "Chalermpong", "last_name": "Senarak", "domain_name": "kasetsart", "page_name": "ChalermpongSenarak", "display_name": "Chalermpong  Senarak", "profile_url": "https://kasetsart.academia.edu/ChalermpongSenarak?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3665350/1295631/13217116/s65_chalermpong.senarak.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10432, "name": "Transportation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transportation?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 298455, "name": "Digitalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digitalization?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 766556, "name": "Container Port and Terminal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Container_Port_and_Terminal?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1366553, "name": "Container Ports", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Container_Ports?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2837810, "name": "Industrial revolution 4.0", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Industrial_revolution_4.0?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 41697263, "title": "Principles for Cyber Security Operations", "created_at": "2020-01-21T20:21:39.622-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41697263/Principles_for_Cyber_Security_Operations?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_41697263", "summary": "This book outlines the principles of security operations and incident response.

Accordingly, we designed and conducted a set of controlled survey experiments with 317 participants in different MSN interface scenarios by manipulating the types of MSN interfaces (i.e., high vs. low disruption), the context (hedonic vs. utilitarian scenarios), and the degree of MSN intrusiveness (high vs. low intrusiveness). We found that both app interface usability and the design of MSNs significantly impacted users\u2019 perceived security, which, in turn, has a positive influence on users\u2019 intention to continue using the app. In addition, we identified an important conundrum: disruptive MSNs\u2014a common approach to delivering MSNs\u2014irritate users and negatively influence their perceptions of app security.

Using a combination of content analysis and grounded theory, this research asked three progressively complex questions.  First, we asked: What are the types of content and the distribution of content on Freenet?  Our findings show that Freenet fosters a singular distribution of content, with a high ratio of blogs (or flogs), child pornography, empty links, and web 1.0 websites that archive information.  We assumed that this content is not discrete points of data, but instead produce sociologically interesting phenomena.  Therefore, we ask: What are the content patterns on Freenet?  Four patterns were identified.  Freenet is (1) an archive of deviant data resistant to censorship (2) a space dominated by content associated with masculinity, (3) a nonmarket space where commercial exchange is non-existent, and (4) an empty space with many requests not returning information, and many flogs abandoned.  We asked a third question: How does the analysis of Freenet inform current understandings of hacker culture? Freenet, we suggest, can be understood as a type of digital \u201cwilderness\u201d.

Data Science provides a significant role in cybersecurity by utilising the power of data (and big data), high-performance computing and data mining (and machine learning) to protect users against cybercrimes.

Attacks from various hacking groups have been conducted on organizations like the LuzSec, Stuxnet and many others that caused various levels of damages. Recent years have even seen groups that are anonymous in nature, targeting businesses that are highly profiled and other organizations. Some attacks have been conducted with much ease, thereby exposing the existing  weaker  systems of  handling cybercrimes and  some breaches  have brought along  very  highly costs incurred  on security. Countries have become very vulnerable in particular with the escalating levels of economy and the essential needs of improving infrastructure, in which has made them rely on technology and computer networks. Cyber threats can be categorized into two, and briefly  they\u2019ve  been  explained.  This  paper  evaluates  some  instances  of  cyber-attacks  in  some  of  the  Muslim  countries  like  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the potential impacts and the possible recommendations that is implemented by governments, can help in raising awareness on cyber-attack issues.

The Snowden Affairs increased the entropy within the broader Internet ecosystem and reignited political tensions that revolve around the US prominence within the narrower arena of critical Internet resources. In this context, many countries have shown great concern regarding the governance of the Internet, and Brazil has gained a prominent role in the debate. This paper (a) summarizes the concerns arisen from Snowden's leaks and their general impacts over the Internet governance ecosystem; (b) details the Brazilian domestic and international approaches to Internet governance focusing on landmark documents and events; and (c) connects the Brazilian efforts to the institutional development of global Internet governance. In the end, the paper reflects upon the implications of alternative thinking for Internet governance pointing towards possible shifts within it.\r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37542966, "asset_id": 12248316, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7057100, "first_name": "Diego", "last_name": "Canabarro", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DiegoCanabarro", "display_name": "Diego Canabarro", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DiegoCanabarro?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7057100/2662669/3099510/s65_diego.canabarro.jpg"}, {"id": 4513567, "first_name": "Thiago", "last_name": "Borne", "domain_name": "ufrgs", "page_name": "ThiagoBorne", "display_name": "Thiago Borne", "profile_url": "https://ufrgs.academia.edu/ThiagoBorne?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4513567/1860726/14931858/s65_thiago.borne.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2674, "name": "Intelligence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intelligence?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7822, "name": "Internet Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_Governance?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 9282577, "title": "New Criminology Series from Palgrave Macmillan", "created_at": "2014-11-12T21:47:04.545-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9282577/New_Criminology_Series_from_Palgrave_Macmillan?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_9282577", "summary": "For more information on submitting a proposal to these or any of our other series, please contact me: mireille.yanow@palgrave-usa.com.\r\n\r\nCritical Criminological Perspectives;

Cyberspace is, after all, the only operational domain that has been entirely created by people, so people have to be able to use it and also to constantly create it anew.\nAccording to the estimates cited e.g. by ENISA in 2019, there was a shortage of over 4 million cybersecurity specialists on a global scale, and approx. 65% of organisations declared staff shortages in the area of tasks related to cybersecurity. A real race for specialists in this domain is observed among both international corporations and domestic companies from plenty of industries, critical infrastructure operators and, finally, intelligence services. In this inter-sectoral, global competition, the public sector (which includes the military) is often in a difficult situation because of the limited possibilities of using financial incentives.\nConsidering the needs and constraints, a resources-building strategy should be adopted that uses all the advantages found within the range of influence of the military sector. The article discusses them using various approaches, based on actions successfully implemented by the Polish Ministry of National Defence under the programme of capacity building in the armed forces to operate in cyberspace. The first aspect the image, motivation and challenges. Service in the cyber armed forces component provides the opportunity to reach areas unattainable anywhere else, including constant interaction with a well-prepared and highly motivated enemy. The second point for consideration is education and continuous improvement. The possibilities to recruit experts who already have a good position in the commercial market are limited. Therefore, development of the military education system is the best way to ensure a steady inflow of staff. In Poland, it was decided both to use military academies for this purpose and a real educational ecosystem is being created and constantly developed, also including a military IT secondary school and a dedicated non-commissioned officer school. Civilian secondary schools run (in co-operation with the Ministry of National Defence, MON) profiled vocational training classes, students of civilian universities undergo military training in cybersecurity, and the performance improvement will be managed by the Expert Cybersecurity Training Centre. The third aspect is the Territorial Defence Force, which gives the opportunity in the Cyberspace Operations Team to combine military service and to continue previous professional work on an extremely competitive market.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65680126, "asset_id": 45113576, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 182225952, "first_name": "Tomasz", "last_name": "Zdzikot", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "TomaszZdzikot", "display_name": "Tomasz Zdzikot", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/TomaszZdzikot?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/182225952/50479917/38504405/s65_tomasz.zdzikot.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 44617, "name": "Armed Forces", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Armed_Forces?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 526060, "name": "Cyber security / cyber warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_security_cyber_warfare?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 652016, "name": "Cyberdefense", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberdefense?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 831496, "name": "Cybersecurity policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity_policy?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 44944519, "title": "The real cybercrime : Cybercrime Legal Manual, Cybercriminology Essay", "created_at": "2021-01-20T19:28:59.535-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44944519/The_real_cybercrime_Cybercrime_Legal_Manual_Cybercriminology_Essay?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_44944519", "summary": "Paedophilia, terrorism, satanist cults, hacking, carding, drugs, weapons\u2026\n\nAfter its success in France, discover the real cybercrime like a cybercriminal member of the worst blackmarkets of the darkweb thanks to the illustrations and detailed explanations of cybercriminology.Who is behind the cybercrime?

Undoubtedly, cyberattacks constitute one potentially serious risk. While a stereotypical scenario involves a curious teenager sitting in front of his computer at home, a much more critical threat comes from experienced professionals, supported by states, who are specially trained and who have the necessary technological equipment to do great harm. These cyberattacks exert a negative impact on the maritime industry due to the wide usage area of both information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems. On a related note, opponents of autonomous ship projects can effectively cite the weaknesses detected in navigation systems onboard ships. Examination of cyberattacks in the maritime industry as reflected in the press or in academic studies reveals claims that some of these attacks are state-sponsored. However, no country has to date accepted responsibility for such cyberattacks. Although those targeted by such accusations have neither confirmed nor rejected responsibility, the nature of the attacks-sophisticated or requiring high-cost equipment-raises the possibility that behind the attacks are countries that may have conducted research studies for defensive or offensive purposes. China, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Turkey have been named among the countries carrying out cyberattacks on the maritime industry. It is envisaged that these attacks are based on motivations such as information theft, defence research or sabotage of exploration for underground sources. Among the cyberattacks on vessels that have been assessed as state-sponsored, the most common have involved GPS jamming, rendering GPS useless, and GPS spoofing that causes the GPS to report an incorrect position for a ship at sea. This study examines the cyberattacks on the maritime industry that are asserted as state-sponsored as well as the parties involved in these attacks and the possible objectives of those parties.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64820045, "asset_id": 44262768, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 40236074, "first_name": "Aybars", "last_name": "Oruc", "domain_name": "ntnu-no", "page_name": "AybarsOruc", "display_name": "Aybars Oruc", "profile_url": "https://ntnu-no.academia.edu/AybarsOruc?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://gravatar.com/avatar/167ce155921d4cded2c00e48a0c80613?s=65"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11337, "name": "Cyber Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Warfare?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60807, "name": "Maritime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 153371, "name": "Electronic Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Electronic_Warfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 481402, "name": "Ships", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ships?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 3067274, "name": "Maritime Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 43549584, "title": "TACKLING THE CYBERSECURITY IMPACTS OF THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK AS A CHALLENGE TO INTERNET SAFETY", "created_at": "2020-07-07T22:53:02.046-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43549584/TACKLING_THE_CYBERSECURITY_IMPACTS_OF_THE_CORONAVIRUS_OUTBREAK_AS_A_CHALLENGE_TO_INTERNET_SAFETY?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_43549584", "summary": "The world is currently ravaged by the novel coronavirus which has so far affected 82,410 persons in 50 countries with a death toll of 2,808 as at 27 th February 2020, and code-named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 th February 2020.

The approach involved a formative design approach, educational design research (EDR) that evolved from design-based research and design experiments commonly employed in fields such as the learning sciences, educational technology, and instructional design. The authors assert that the EDR process used to design an educational CCG is an effective approach for formative learning game design work. Keywords Cybersecurity. Educational design research. Design based research. Collectible card games The information age has an Achilles heel. Governments and enterprise organizations greatly rely upon computer systems and networks for their ability to exchange information and support decision processes. However, this digital infrastructure is also vulnerable to attacks by criminals, foreign nations, hackers, and disgruntled employees. In 2015, the Government Accountability Office reported that the number of security incidents related to federal agencies increased from approximately 5503 in 2006 to 67,168 in 2014, a more than tenfold increase (Wilshusen 2015).

Today, the use of radio communication equipment is increasing by numerous organisations and businesses. The functionality of these traditionally short-range devices have expanded to include private call, address book, call-logs, text messages, lone worker, telemetry, data communication, and GPS. Many of these devices also integrate with smartphones, which delivers Push-To-Talk services that make it possible to setup connections between users using a two-way radio and a smartphone. In fact, these devices can be used to connect users only using smartphones. To date, there is little research on the digital traces in modern radio communication equipment. In fact, increasing the knowledge base about these radio communication devices and services can be valuable to law enforcement in a police investigation. In this paper, we investigate what kind of radio communication equipment and services law enforcement digital investigators can encounter at a crime scene or in an investigation. Subsequent to seizure of this radio communication equipment we explore the traces, which may have a forensic interest and how these traces can be acquired. Finally, we test our approach on sample radio communication equipment and services.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57046786, "asset_id": 36740945, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

unified taxonomy for the field of Information Ethics is both unattainable and unwarranted. The categorization of Information Ethics as a defined discipline, an applicable practice, a philosophy and a worldview remains constantly in flux due to, what Luciano Floridi terms, \u2018philosophical naturalism\u2019. As such, a broadening understanding of the field will only serve to further collapse categorization. The following paper will outline, using a discourse analysis methodology, how the nature of the field of Information Ethics at a foundational level must necessarily defy classification. The assumptions behind the current classifications of the field will be questioned. Beginning with the history of the inception of the field through Librarianship and Cybernetics and questioning the yet unresolved ontological debates between information philosophers such as Rafael Capurro and Floridi, this paper will explicate how any such attempt to develop an agreed upon taxonomy will and should always remain incomplete.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34886150,

However, given the fact that critical national infrastructures and the private sector are increasingly dependent on digital assets, cyberspace has become an important aspect of their bilateral relationship. The purpose of this paper is to define the nature of U.S.-China relationship in cyberspace and identify issues that cause conflict between Washington and Beijing. For both sides, cyberspace is a realm where they exercise power politics in order to pursue their national interests. The two global competitors have different positions on most of the issues that relate to cyberspace. Fear and uncertainty are present in cyberspace for both Washington and Beijing. Nevertheless, they also have common goals. The level of interdependence between them is high and avoiding misperception and escalation is a mutual priority. Therefore, both sides are trying to avoid mistrust and conflict in cyberspace and establish some cooperative mechanisms. Based on previous practice from nuclear diplomacy, both sides are in the process of identifying diplomatic tools (e.g. confidence building measures, Track II diplomacy and simulations) in order to avoid unnecessary tension in cyberspace.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33288892, "asset_id": 6513099, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 227716,

Despite having no totally agreed-upon definition, cyber-security refers to a different understanding of security. In other words, military measures are not the main instruments to provide that kind of security. In a similar vein, as a result of globalization and the developments in information technologies, cybersecurity has become more critical for both governments and international organizations. Not only in Turkey, but in many other countries, the more digitalized the world has become, the more popular and debated cybersecurity-related issues have become in media discourse. On the other hand, it is known that, recently critical discourse analysis has been a quite useful analytical tool for researchers to analyze news discourse. Discourse historical approach is a methodological tool in critical discourse studies which stresses the significance of historical context within which the discourse is embedded and the power relations can be analyzed. This article serves two purposes: First is to shed light on the concept of cybersecurity in general and the second is to analyze the state of cybersecurity in media of Turkey in particular. In this sense, cybersecurity-related news in Turkish print and online media play a key role in monitoring cybersecurity in Turkey. The news will be analyzed through applying Critical Discourse Analysis (Discourse Historical Approach in this study). The main conclusion of the study is that cybersecurity-related news cannot have a self-isolated nature like national security news and cyber threats are similar although the countries differ.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64014123, "asset_id": 43708264, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 295348, "first_name": "Begum", "last_name": "Burak, PhD", "domain_name": "independentresearcher", "page_name": "BegumBurak", "display_name": "Begum Burak, PhD", "profile_url": "https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/BegumBurak?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/295348/59809/38462773/s65_begum.burak.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 94, "name": "Discourse Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Discourse_Analysis?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10633, "name": "Critical Discourse Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Discourse_Analysis?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12756, "name": "Cyberbullying", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberbullying?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12850, "name": "Media Discourse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Discourse?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 30947, "name": "The Internet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Internet?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 149517, "name": "Turkish Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Turkish_Media?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 319176, "name": "Discourse-Historical Approach", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Discourse-Historical_Approach?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 322916, "name": "News Discourse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/News_Discourse?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 42764380, "title": "CULEGEREA DE INFORMA\u0162II DE SECURITATE NA\u0162IONAL\u0102 \u00ceN ERA DIGITAL\u0102 -DIMENSIUNEA ETIC\u0102", "created_at": "2020-04-17T02:46:45.901-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42764380/CULEGEREA_DE_INFORMA%C5%A2II_DE_SECURITATE_NA%C5%A2IONAL%C4%82_%C3%8EN_ERA_DIGITAL%C4%82_DIMENSIUNEA_ETIC%C4%82?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_42764380", "summary": "The study is aiming to convey an interdisciplinary analysis to what gathering intelligence in digital space represents from a legal point of view and what the lack of ethics of such state governed endeavours cause to a democratic society by examining the latest case studies in European and international jurisprudence.

It examines 1) the global network structure, 2) the local network structure, and 3) identifies those vendor characteristics that best explain variation in the network structure. In doing so, it evaluates the role of trust in online drug markets. \nMethods: The study draws on a unique dataset of transaction level data from an encrypted online drug market. Structural measures and community detection analysis are used to characterize and investigate the network structure. Exponential random graph modeling is used to evaluate which vendor characteristics explain variation in purchasing patterns. \nResults: Vendors\u2019 trustworthiness explains more variation in the overall network structure than the affordability of vendor products or the diversity of vendor product listings. This results in a highly localized network structure with a few key vendors accounting for most transactions. \nConclusions: The results indicate that vendors\u2019 trustworthiness is a better predictor of vendor selection than product diversity or affordability. These results illuminate the internal market dynamics that sustain digital drug markets and highlight the importance of examining how new anonymizing technologies shape global drug distribution networks. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53423508, "asset_id": 33366629, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 21451223, "first_name": "Scott", "last_name": "Duxbury", "domain_name": "unc", "page_name": "ScottDuxbury", "display_name": "Scott Duxbury", "profile_url": "https://unc.academia.edu/ScottDuxbury?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/21451223/10214450/11398767/s65_scott.duxbury.jpg"}, {"id": 26729971, "first_name": "Dana", "last_name": "Haynie", "domain_name": "osu", "page_name": "DanaHaynie", "display_name": "Dana L Haynie", "profile_url": "https://osu.academia.edu/DanaHaynie?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26729971/19477885/52817734/s65_dana.haynie.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2511, "name": "Cybercrimes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrimes?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3043, "name": "Trust", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trust?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13739, "name": "Social Network Analysis (SNA)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Network_Analysis_SNA_?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20594, "name": "Cyber crime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_crime?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 50820, "name": "Organized Crime, Drugs and Crime, Cybercrime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organized_Crime_Drugs_and_Crime_Cybercrime?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 51527, "name": "Community Detection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Detection?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 89751, "name": "Cybercrime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrime?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 500214, "name": "Bipartite Graph", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bipartite_Graph?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 789103, "name": "ERGMs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ERGMs?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1185087, "name": "Drug Markets", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Drug_Markets?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1204733, "name": "Online Drug Marketplaces", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Online_Drug_Marketplaces?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1328447, "name": "Drug Distribution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Drug_Distribution?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1510168, "name": "Co-Offending", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Co-Offending?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2095103, "name": "Bipartite Networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bipartite_Networks?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2186770, "name": "Cryptomarkets", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cryptomarkets?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 32411922, "title": "The Geopolitics of Cybersecurity", "created_at": "2017-04-13T08:54:51.705-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32411922/The_Geopolitics_of_Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_32411922", "summary": "Cisco cybersecurity specialist suggests Romania\u2019s hacking problem could be solved if foreign companies hired the young brilliant minds in Romania.

Considering the ever incompleteness of detection and prevention and the impact and consequence of malfunctions of the safety-critical operations caused by cyber incidents, this paper proposes a new computer control system architecture which assures resiliency even under compromised situations. The proposed architecture is centered on diversification of hardware systems and unidirectional communication from the proposed system in alerting suspicious activities to upper layers. This paper details the architectural structure of the proposed cyber defensive computer control system architecture for power substation applications and its validation in lab experimentation and on a

Daily reports of incidents appear in public media including major ex-filtrations of data for the purposes of stealing identities, credit card numbers, and intellectual property as well as to take control of network resources. Methods used by attackers constantly change in order to defeat techniques employed by information technology (IT) teams intended to discover or block intrusions. \u201cZero Day\u201d attacks whose \u201csignatures\u201d are not yet in IT databases are continually being uncovered. Machine learning approaches have been widely used to increase the effectiveness of intrusion detection platforms. While some machine learning techniques are effective at detecting certain types of attacks, there are no known methods that can be applied universally and achieve consistent results for multiple attack types. The focus of our research is the development of a framework that combines the outputs of multiple learners in order to improve the efficacy of network intrusion on data that contains instances of multiple classes of attacks. We have chosen the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as the core learning algorithm due to recent research that suggests that ELMs are straightforward to implement, computationally efficient and have excellent learning performance characteristics on par with the Support Vector Machine (SVM), one of the most widely used and best performing machine learning platforms (Liu, Gao, & Li, 2012). We introduce the novel Multiple Adaptive Reduced Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (MARK-ELM) which combines Multiple Kernel Boosting (Xia & Hoi, 2013) with the Multiple Classification Reduced Kernel ELM (Deng, Zheng, & Zhang, 2013). We tested this approach on several machine learning datasets as well as the KDD Cup 99 (Hettich & Bay, 1999) intrusion detection dataset. Our results indicate that MARK-ELM works well for the majority of University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository small datasets and is scalable for larger datasets. For UCI datasets we achieved performance similar to the MKBoost Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach. In our experiments we demonstrate that MARK-ELM achieves superior detection rates and much lower false alarm rates than other approaches on intrusion detection data.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47096426, "asset_id": 12837350, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2876227, "first_name": "john", "last_name": "fossaceca", "domain_name": "gwu", "page_name": "jfossaceca", "display_name": "john fossaceca", "profile_url": "https://gwu.academia.edu/jfossaceca?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2876227/9578286/18481609/s65_john.fossaceca.jpg"}, {"id": 61252565, "first_name": "Thomas", "last_name": "Mazzuchi", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ThomasMazzuchi", "display_name": "Thomas Mazzuchi", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ThomasMazzuchi?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2008, "name": "Machine Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Machine_Learning?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 11641218, "title": "Chinese Military Cyber Capabilities Development \u4e2d\u56fd\u519b\u961f\u7f51\u7edc\u6218\u80fd\u529b", "created_at": "2015-03-24T13:30:33.282-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11641218/Chinese_Military_Cyber_Capabilities_Development_%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%86%9B%E9%98%9F%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E6%88%98%E8%83%BD%E5%8A%9B?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_11641218", "summary": "Since 2005, the number of Chinese troops for the invasion of the US network activities more and more.

digital atau cyberspace membawa banyak sekali manfaat bagi umat manusia dengan tersedianya media dan jaringan internet yang dapat dengan mudah diakses oleh siapa pun, kapan pun, dan dimana pun. Namun, mengingat bahwa dunia digital merupakan ruang maya yang sangat luas dan tidak ada batasannya, seringkali kita temui macam-macam kejahatan digital yang tentu sangat berbahaya dan merugikan. Tercurinya data-data penting, hacking, adanya malware, itu semua merupakan beberapa contoh kejahatan digital yang sering kita jumpai. Oleh karena itu, penelitian ini dilakukan untuk mencari solusi minimalnya untuk mengurangi terjadinya dampak yang lebih fatal akan kejahatan siber berdasarkan perspektif geopolitik Indonesia. Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian kualitatif menggunakan metode pengumpulan data yaitu teknik observasi dan studi pustaka. Hasil penelitian menunjukan bahwa telah terjadi banyak kejahatan siber yang tidak hanya mengancam diri pribadi seseorang, tetapi juga mengancam keutuhan Negara Kesatuan Republik Indonesia. Oleh karena itu,  Polisi Siber hadir sebagai wadah dimana masyarakat dapat mengadukan kejahatan digital tersebut melalui layanan Polisi Siber baik di website maupun di Instagram. Polisi Siber diharapkan dapat mengurangi kejahatan digital yang sangat meresahkan masyarakat dan menuntun masyarakat supaya dapat lebih berhati-hati berselancar di ruang digital.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82144957, "asset_id": 73743431, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 203694240, "first_name": "Chery", "last_name": "Berliana", "domain_name": "undip", "page_name": "CheryBerliana", "display_name": "Chery O K T A Berliana", "profile_url": "https://undip.academia.edu/CheryBerliana?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/203694240/64601814/52925943/s65_chery.okta.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 89751, "name": "Cybercrime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrime?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2802174, "name": "Geopolitik Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geopolitik_Indonesia?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3076626, "name": "Kejahatan Siber", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kejahatan_Siber?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 48325114, "title": "Divided by a common language: Cyber definitions in Chinese, Russian and English", "created_at": "2021-05-04T13:56:26.890-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/48325114/Divided_by_a_common_language_Cyber_definitions_in_Chinese_Russian_and_English?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_48325114", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67006088, "asset_id": 48325114, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 551241, "first_name": "Bill", "last_name": "Hagestad", "domain_name": "umn", "page_name": "BillHagestad", "display_name": "Bill Hagestad", "profile_url": "https://umn.academia.edu/BillHagestad?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/551241/9417375/10494382/s65_bill.hagestad.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1432, "name": "Natural Language Processing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Natural_Language_Processing?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2099, "name": "Information Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Society?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2716, "name": "Russian", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2789, "name": "Government", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Government?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 11335, "name": "Cyber Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Conflict?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 11337, "name": "Cyber Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Warfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 12108, "name": "China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 13923, "name": "Computer Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 19861, "name": "Russian Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian_Language?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 20602, "name": "China studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China_studies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 27730, "name": "Politics of Russia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_Russia?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 41863, "name": "Russia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russia?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 53231, "name": "Chinese Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Language?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 96546, "name": "Cyber Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 249490, "name": "Cyber", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 362933, "name": "Language Translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Translation?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 988385, "name": "Common Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Common_Language?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 45520017, "title": "ISO/SAE 21434 Training | Road Vehicles Cybersecurity Engineering Training Workshop", "created_at": "2021-03-14T09:49:19.280-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45520017/ISO_SAE_21434_Training_Road_Vehicles_Cybersecurity_Engineering_Training_Workshop?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_45520017", "summary": "ISO/SAE 21434 is an automotive standard currently under development that focuses on the cybersecurity risk in road vehicle electronic systems.

The adoption of ICT into the Kenyan County Governments, therefore, promises equal growth and output. These benefits notwithstanding, integration of ICT systems into County Governments is faced with a number of challenges in terms of vulnerabilities and other cybersecurity risks. This paper sought to identify the key facilitators of cybersecurity vulnerabilities in Kenyan County Governments only. The exploratory research design was used as a methodology. Questionnaires and interview schedules were the main instruments of data collection. The data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The findings indicate that there is a need for County Governments in Kenya to prepare for cybersecurity related challenges through policy formulations, End-users and ICT experts awareness on cybersecurity-attacks, Management support through resources funding and cybersecurity infrastructure is key to any system controls. The solutions to cybersecurity vulnerabilities in Kenyan County governments can be solved when these keys are implemented.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63562056, "asset_id": 43286152, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 16301758, "first_name": "KADIMA", "last_name": "CHITECHI", "domain_name": "mmust", "page_name": "KADIMACHITECHI", "display_name": "KADIMA CHITECHI", "profile_url": "https://mmust.academia.edu/KADIMACHITECHI?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/16301758/4421922/35230598/s65_kadima.chitechi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 37, "name": "Information Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Systems?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 491, "name": "Information Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Technology?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 492, "name": "Management Information Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Management_Information_Systems?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 43058935, "title": "Privacy as Care in the Internet of Things", "created_at": "2020-05-15T04:17:00.731-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43058935/Privacy_as_Care_in_the_Internet_of_Things?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_43058935", "summary": "The overwhelming majority of contemporary discussion of privacy focuses on personally identifiable information as property, and research on privacy nearly always finds, in what is called \u201cthe privacy paradox,\u201d that users don\u2019t care enough and in the right way about \u201cprivacy\u201d as it has been framed in legal and technical contexts. This is a strikingly normative perspective, assuming that users\u2019 mental models must be reformed in order to conform with legal-juridical models of privacy rather than designing systems to follow users\u2019 intuitive mental models. It might be productive in a number of different ways to instead first ask in what way people do in fact care about privacy and to design and redesign policies to afford this good rather than trying to change human values to conform to our legal-technical environment.   \n\nIn this chapter, I outline an interpersonal phenomenology of privacy oriented by ethics of care, considering privacy as it appears in parenting, friendship, romantic and sexual relationships, and care for elderly and disabled persons. This phenomenology identifies three distinctive dynamics of privacy in interpersonal contexts, having to do with autonomy, intimacy, and consent. These elements of the phenomenology of privacy in interpersonal contexts are then applied to a variety of kinds of IoT devices and systems: GPS navigators, the Amazon Alexa virtual assistant, Nest, and two medical robots\u2014PARO and RIBA. \n\nThe most distinctive and useful of these differences are drawn together into conclusions on two major themes. First, that privacy in a legal-juridical context is commodified relative to privacy in interpersonal contexts: in the legal-juridical context, loss of privacy is framed as negative loss where it may appear instead as a positive gain in interpersonal contexts. Second, the strongly divergent understanding of consent as needing constant renewal rather than being a box to be checked in clickthrough licensing seems to demand transformative reforms from companies interested in engineering ethics.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63318651, "asset_id": 43058935, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 27809, "first_name": "D.E.", "last_name": "Wittkower", "domain_name": "odu", "page_name": "DEWittkower", "display_name": "D.E.

However, we argue that this research has not correctly conceptualized the decision-making processes involved in ICA. Thus, our first aim is to demonstrate this opportunity by leveraging the rational choice perspective (RCP) from criminology. The RCP advances an \u201cevent\u201d stage, in which choices are made leading up to and during the criminal act. However, the RCP also acknowledges a preceding \u201cinitial involvement\u201d stage, which encompasses those factors that lead an individual to consider participation in crime. RCP explains that if, during the initial involvement stage, an individual becomes motivated and decides that future criminal behavior is the most suitable course of action, then he or she will have reached a state of \u201creadiness.\u201d It is only after an individual has become readied, and at a later time, does the individual make event decisions in the perpetration of a specific crime. Consequently, extant ICA research has overlooked consideration of why\u2014prior to the crime-an individual initially considers engaging in such criminal activity in the first instance. Notably, this consideration should not to be conflated with intentions. We argue that there needs to be a clear distinction between those motivational factors that would lead to the consideration of such engagement at the initial involvement stage, and those factors that would lead an individual at the event stage to perpetrate a crime. We thus propose a revised version of the extended security action cycle (ESAC), which reflects these criminal decision-making stages. Moreover, we provide a means through which to identify and understand the relationship among those factors that may motivate an individual during the initial involvement stage, by drawing on the life course perspective (LCP). With a focus on time, context, and process, the LCP offers a framework in which are inscribed four key principles. Through examples drawn from the LCP and white-collar crime literature, we illustrate how these principles can provide a basis for conceptualizing factors that motivate ICA and open up new avenues for future research/theory development.

The proposed framework will allow for the development of detailed strategies and plans to address the specific demands posed by cyberthreats, whether state-based, or by non-state actors, or individuals.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53848488, "asset_id": 33870904, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5533940, "first_name": "Matthew", "last_name": "Cohen", "domain_name": "neu", "page_name": "MatthewCohen", "display_name": "Matthew Cohen", "profile_url": "https://neu.academia.edu/MatthewCohen?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5533940/9037537/10175969/s65_matthew.cohen.jpg"}, {"id": 33726367, "first_name": "Gabi", "last_name": "Siboni", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "GabiSiboni", "display_name": "Gabi Siboni", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/GabiSiboni?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33726367/13182606/14478345/s65_gabi.siboni.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3705, "name": "International Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4370, "name": "Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5523, "name": "Security Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_Studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 61620, "name": "National Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 294517, "name": "Defense and Strategic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Defense_and_Strategic_Studies?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 33741025, "title": "Automated Machine Learning-Based Digital Evidence Classification Techniques", "created_at": "2017-07-02T12:16:07.635-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33741025/Automated_Machine_Learning_Based_Digital_Evidence_Classification_Techniques?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_33741025", "summary": "The exponential growth of data storage is a problem that must be tackled in a cyber realm era where criminal activities are perpetrated constantly.

Kemampuan untuk mengakses serta bertukar data sudah sangat cepat. Hal ini juga mempengaruhi dunia kriminalitas pada dunia maya atau lebih dikenal dengan cyber crime. Seorang atau kelompok secara sengaja mengambil dan menyebarluaskan ataupun menggunakan sebuah informasi penting tanpa tanggung jawab. dengan demikian perlunya sebuah pengamanan untuk menjaga kerahasiaan suatu data. Pengamanan data pada SMA Negeri 1 Weleri terutama pada data soal-soal ujian berangkat dari rentannya data yang berada di computer tanpa pengamanan khusus. Terlebih lagi tentang keluhan bocornya soal-soal ujian yang beredar luas di kalangan siswa dalam bentuk dokumen dalam smartphone mereka. Sehingga dilakukan cara atau metode untuk mengamankan data yang penting terutama soal ujian. Metode yang akan digunakan dalam penelitian tugas akhir ini adalah AES sebagai algoritma kriptografinya dan End of File sebagai Metode penyisipannya. Sehingga keamanan akan lebih terjaga dengan memperkuat keamanan serta menyembunyikannya dalam suatu berkas yang lain. Hasilnya data akan lebih terjaga kerahasiaannya dan dapat diakses kembali dengan aman. Selain itu dapat diaplikasikan pada tahun-tahun kedepan. Abstract From this century technology has been grow rapidly, especially in global information exchange. The ability to access and exchange data very fast already. It also affected criminality in the virtual world, or also known as cyber crime. Both of it deliberately retrieve and disseminate or use an important information without responsibility. Thus the need for a security to maintain the confidentiality of the data. Securing data at SMA Negeri 1 Weleri on the data exam questions departing from the vulnerability of the data residing on the computer without special security. Moreover, on the complaint of leaking exam questions were widely circulated among the students with documents in their smartphones. So do ways or methods to secure data especially exams. In this research the method that we used is AES as cryptography algorithm and End of File as a method of steganography. So security will be maintained by strengthening and hide them in another file. The data result will be kept confidential and can be accessed again. Moreover, it can be applied in future.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52361919, "asset_id": 32115397, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6677441, "first_name": "Ardiant Yosa", "last_name": "Hastaka", "domain_name": "dinus", "page_name": "yosasensei", "display_name": "Ardiant Yosa  Hastaka", "profile_url": "https://dinus.academia.edu/yosasensei?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6677441/5700932/20435739/s65_ardiant_yosa.hastaka.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5523, "name": "Security Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_Studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16542, "name": "Cryptography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cryptography?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20594, "name": "Cyber crime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_crime?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 32055, "name": "Steganography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Steganography?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 27223354, "title": "Cyber-Physical-Security Model for Safety-Critical IoT Infrastructures", "created_at": "2016-07-24T11:08:42.358-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27223354/Cyber_Physical_Security_Model_for_Safety_Critical_IoT_Infrastructures?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_27223354", "summary": "The Internet of Things (IoT) and the number of sensors integrated within safety critical environments is increasing exponentially. System designers employ off-the-shelf hardware to reduce development time and cost, however, the early adoption of consumer hardware and software raises numerous security questions. Several successful attacks and threats to critical infrastructures have been reported. This paper reviews safety-critical applications in aviation, connected cars and power plants. An engineering development roadmap is proposed with cyber-security in mind from \" cradle-to-grave \" rather than an afterthought. The development roadmap introduces a cyber-security review at each design step to strengthen the robustness of IoT hardware and software. However, considering these systems have an extremely long lifetime (>20 years), secure maintenance and integrity of ageing infrastructure is usually a secondary consideration. The paper proposes the use of a cyclic cyber-physical security model after system commissioning that allows knowledge transfer between regulatory bodies through sharing of best practices. The sharing will enable system operators to identify exploits encountered from other industries and maintain high security levels and improve the IoT architectures.", "downloadable_attachments":

disillusionment and semi-animosity pervading the overall relationship dynamic. Thus, when an American 'Russian expert' is asked about recent conversations in Moscow about controlling illegal or undocumented migration into and across Russia, more likely than not a lecture will ensue about violations of human rights, the inexorable rise of Russian nationalism and xenophobia, and, of course, the increasing desire of President Putin to bring more authoritarianism to the Russian Federation. Unfortunately, while aspects of all three of these issues can be force-fed into the migration/immigration topic, this would actually be doing a disservice to a more subtle understanding of the concerns not only facing the Russian Federation but the wider global community, especially the European Union.

One of the outcomes of these reforms is the introduction of certification schemes for information and communication technology (ICT) products, services and processes, as well as for data processing operations concerning personal data. These schemes aim to provide an avenue for consumers to assess the compliance posture of organisations concerning the privacy and security of ICT products, services and processes. They also present manufacturers, providers and data controllers with the opportunity to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements through a verifiable third-party assessment. As these certification schemes are being developed, various sectors, including the electrical power and energy sector, will need to access the impact on their operations and plan towards successful implementation. Relying on a doctrinal method, this paper identifies relevant EU legal instruments on data protection and cybersecurity certification and their interpretation in order to examine their potential impact when applying certification schemes within the Electrical Power and Energy System (EPES) domain. The result suggests that the EPES domain employs different technologies and services from diverse areas, which can result in the application of several certification schemes within its environment, including horizontal, technological and sector-specific schemes. This has the potential for creating a complex constellation of implementation models and would require careful design to avoid proliferation and disincentivising of stakeholders.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82443559, "asset_id": 74214793, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25896117, "first_name": "Panagiotis", "last_name": "Radoglou Grammatikis", "domain_name": "uowm", "page_name": "PanagiotisRadoglouGrammatikis", "display_name": "Panagiotis Radoglou Grammatikis", "profile_url": "https://uowm.academia.edu/PanagiotisRadoglouGrammatikis?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/25896117/13044134/18711174/s65_panagiotis.radoglou_grammatikis.jpeg"}, {"id": 204094997, "first_name": "Iheanyi", "last_name": "Nwankwo", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "IheanyiNwankwo2", "display_name": "Iheanyi Nwankwo", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/IheanyiNwankwo2?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://gravatar.com/avatar/c18f0774145ac504012f421e4364738d?s=65"}, {"id": 14008313, "first_name": "George", "last_name": "Lazaridis", "domain_name": "ihu-gr", "page_name": "GeorgeLazaridis", "display_name": "George Lazaridis", "profile_url": "https://ihu-gr.academia.edu/GeorgeLazaridis?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14008313/4194804/4884295/s65_george.lazaridis.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5412, "name": "Energy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Energy?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 90821, "name": "Data Protection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_Protection?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 353644, "name": "Certification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Certification?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 58038613, "title": "The Naked Sun: Malicious Cooperation Between Benign-Looking Processes", "created_at": "2021-10-15T01:25:24.046-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/58038613/The_Naked_Sun_Malicious_Cooperation_Between_Benign_Looking_Processes?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_58038613", "summary": "Recent progress in machine learning has generated promising results in behavioral malware detection. Behavioral modeling identifies malicious processes via features derived by their runtime behavior. Behavioral features hold great promise as they are intrinsically related to the functioning of each malware, and are therefore considered difficult to evade. Indeed, while a significant amount of results exists on evasion of static malware features, evasion of dynamic features has seen limited work. This paper thoroughly examines the robustness of behavioral malware detectors to evasion, focusing particularly on antiransomware evasion. We choose ransomware as its behavior tends to differ significantly from that of benign processes, making it a low-hanging fruit for behavioral detection (and a difficult candidate for evasion). Our analysis identifies a set of novel attacks that distribute the overall malware workload across a small set of cooperating processes to avoid the generation of significant behavioral features. Our most effective attack decreases the accuracy of a state-of-the-art classifier from 98.6% to 0% using only 18 cooperating processes. Furthermore, we show our attacks to be effective against commercial ransomware detectors even in a black-box setting.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 72643468, "asset_id": 58038613, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 58932615, "first_name": "Fabio", "last_name": "De Gaspari", "domain_name": "uniroma", "page_name": "FabioDeGaspari", "display_name": "Fabio De Gaspari", "profile_url": "https://uniroma.academia.edu/FabioDeGaspari?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/58932615/65734842/54075747/s65_fabio.de_gaspari.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2008, "name": "Machine Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Machine_Learning?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50154, "name": "Malware", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malware?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 78529, "name": "Malware Detection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malware_Detection?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2482967, "name": "ransomware", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ransomware?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 27480834, "title": "Napl\u00f3z\u00e1s e-korm\u00e1nyzati rendszerekben", "created_at": "2016-08-02T14:25:06.074-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27480834/Napl%C3%B3z%C3%A1s_e_korm%C3%A1nyzati_rendszerekben?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_27480834", "summary": "Az informatikai rendszerek biztons\u00e1g\u00e1nak egyik legfontosabb alapk\u00f6ve a megfelel\u0151 napl\u00f3z\u00e1s, azaz az infrastrukt\u00far\u00e1ban t\u00f6rt\u00e9nt esem\u00e9nyek r\u00f6gz\u00edt\u00e9se.

By devices, we mean not only mobile phones and computers but also servers and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Therefore, if a ransomware infection occurs (and there is no data backup), the company may lose, for example, access to invoices, customers, and intellectual property. The infection can also lead to stagnation of the company's level of work or a complete halt in production. Depending on the specialization of the company or organization, their clients may also suffer, which may ultimately result in their loss in favor of a competitor. Companies and organizations identify ransomware as their biggest security issue; the reason why it is classified as such is not necessarily due to the high prevalence of this type of malware, it is seen as the number one enemy because of highly publicized attacks, such as WannaCry and NotPetya, which caused billions of dollars in damage, appearing in articles around the world. Thus, even a person who did not experience a ransomware infection perceived it as a serious threat. Email remains the most commonly used medium for ransomware distribution. While ransomware infection often begins with a click on a suspicious link or a bogus invoice, e-mail remains the most commonly used medium for distributing this type of attack in a two-step process. The first step is to send a download file, followed by ransomware as a secondary infection. To combat these scenarios, use products such as Mail Security and Endpoint products, cloud-based sandboxing technology and Machine Learning models to detect the latest types of threats. So that in the end, as a result, attachments that have been classified as malicious are removed and the recipient receives detection information. The need to increase the awareness of security among employees. It is not yet clear whether the attackers' proficiency or the employees' negligent security habits make ransomware attacks successful in a company. There are different types of ransomware, whether sophisticated or not. The risk of getting infected with it is just one of the reasons why companies should focus on training employees about potential threats, and what to do if they have already acted incorrectly. What should not be forgotten is the role of the IT staff responsible for the overall state of the system. What caused the spread of WannaCry? Operating systems without security patches. The attackers exploited a known vulnerability, so the only action that companies had to take in terms of prevention was to \"get vaccinated\" against the infection, that is, to install the available security patches.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63108569, "asset_id": 42867984, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 430952, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Giordani", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JohnGiordani", "display_name": "John Giordani", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JohnGiordani?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/430952/43532997/83272398/s65_john.giordani.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 42775888, "title": "An Ontological Bibliography from Published Works", "created_at": "2020-04-18T06:16:22.096-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42775888/An_Ontological_Bibliography_from_Published_Works?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_42775888", "summary": "This document accumulates the bibliographic references utilized in the collected publications of the author over a 35-year period from 1985 to 2020.

Since Stuxnet (a malicious computer worm) in 2010 demonstrated how computer code could be weaponised to generate political effect, cyberweapons have increasingly been discussed in terms of potential regulation and prohibition. Most analyses focus on how global institutions and regimes might be developed to regulate the development and use of cyberweapons and identify the political and technical obstacles to fulfilling this ambition. This focus on centralized authority obscures identification of existing governance efforts in this field, which together constitute an emerging global governance architecture for offensive cyber capabilities. This article explores three sources of cyberweapons governance\u2014cyberwarfare, cybercrime and export controls on dual-use technologies\u2014and briefly describes their political dynamics and prospects. It is argued that although fragmented, the global governance of cyberweapons should not be dismissed on this basis. Fragmentation is a condition of global governance, not its antithesis, and policy should respect this fragmentation instead of regarding it as an impediment to further development of cyberweapons governance.

This concern combined with the complexity of cyberspace and political agendas, has caused a misrepresentation of the cyber-threat. Although the motivation of cyber-attacks has only been associated with criminal behavior, espionage and even terrorism; current Administrations and the media would have the country believe that a cyber-war is upon us. This paper demonstrates that cyber-war is certainly a misnomer. To date there has been an inability to acquire any substantial, irrefutable evidence of cyber-warfare; only speculations based on historical information, rumors, propaganda and misinterpretation or misrepresentation of facts. Current international legal framework and interpretations indicate that what has been termed cyber-warfare does not match the criteria for war. While the dispute over the term cyber-war and what it represents will definitely continue, there is consensus on the reality of cyber-weapons and cyber-attacks.

intelligence (AI) transparency for purposes of ensuring safety and preventing discrimination. International statutes are increasingly mandating that algorithmic decision-making be explained to affected individuals when such decisions impact an individual\u2019s legal rights, and U.S. scholars continue to call for transparency in automated decision-making.\n\nUnfortunately, modern AI technology does not function like traditional, human-designed algorithms. Due to the unavailability of alternative intellectual property (IP) protections and their often dynamically inscrutable status, algorithms created by AI are often protected under trade-secrecy status, which prohibits sharing the details of a trade secret, lest destroy the trade secret. Furthermore, dynamic inscrutability, the true \u201cblack box,\u201d makes these algorithms secret by definition: even their creators cannot easily explain how they work. When mandated by statute, it may be tremendously difficult, expensive, and undesirable from an IP perspective to require organizations to explain their AI algorithms. Despite this challenge, it may still be possible to satisfy safety and fairness goals by instead focusing on AI system and process disclosure.\n\nThis Article first explains how AI differs from historically defined software and computer code. This Article then explores the dominant scholarship calling for opening the black box and the reciprocal pushback from organizations likely to rely on trade secret protection\u2014a natural fit for AI\u2019s dynamically inscrutable algorithms. Finally, using a simplified information fiduciary framework, I propose an alternative for promoting disclosure while balancing organizational interests via public AI system disclosure and black-box testing.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67454036, "asset_id": 49062767, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11027962, "first_name": "Charlotte", "last_name": "Tschider", "domain_name": "luc", "page_name": "CharlotteTschider", "display_name": "Charlotte A Tschider", "profile_url": "https://luc.academia.edu/CharlotteTschider?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11027962/3271644/59104072/s65_charlotte.tschider.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 465, "name": "Artificial Intelligence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Artificial_Intelligence?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 814, "name": "Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23506, "name": "Information Security and Privacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security_and_Privacy?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27557, "name": "Privacy (Law)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Privacy_Law_?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 81182, "name": "Deep Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deep_Learning?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 97108, "name": "Data Privacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_Privacy?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 111320, "name": "Fairness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fairness?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 46876384, "title": "La brecha de ciberseguridad en Am\u00e9rica Latina frente al contexto global de ciberamenazas The Cyber Security Gap in Latin America Against the Global Context of Cyber Threats", "created_at": "2021-04-14T19:07:46.594-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/46876384/La_brecha_de_ciberseguridad_en_Am%C3%A9rica_Latina_frente_al_contexto_global_de_ciberamenazas_The_Cyber_Security_Gap_in_Latin_America_Against_the_Global_Context_of_Cyber_Threats?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_46876384", "summary": "RESUMEN: La presente investigaci\u00f3n parte de la hip\u00f3tesis de que los gobiernos de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe est\u00e1n rezagados en la construcci\u00f3n de ciber capacidades de defensa para enfrentar el contexto actual e internacional de ciber amenazas, respecto a los pa\u00edses miembros de la Organizaci\u00f3n del Tratado del Atl\u00e1ntico Norte (OTAN), tanto en el plano de organizaci\u00f3n, como en el individual. Para probar este enunciado el texto se divide en seis secciones. En la primera se presenta el entorno global amenazas provenientes de ciberespacio, las p\u00e9rdidas econ\u00f3micas que sufren gobiernos y empresas seg\u00fan informes de firmas de seguridad inform\u00e1tica como Kaspersky, Microsoft, Verizon e International Business Machines Corporation (IBM).

En la tercera se aborda la trayectoria de la OTAN como organizaci\u00f3n en el desarrollo ciber capacidades en los \u00faltimos veinte a\u00f1os. En la cuarta parte, se analiza desde el nivel individual un conjunto de Estrategias Nacionales de Ciberseguridad (ENCS) de los pa\u00edses y aliados de la OTAN, de las cuales se extraen sus principales elementos y se esquematiza su anatom\u00eda general. En la sexta parte, se presenta una aproximaci\u00f3n a diferentes entornos regionales o globales de ciberseguridad con base a mediciones del Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI), de la Uni\u00f3n Internacional de Telecomunicaciones (ITU por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s), y el National Cyber Security Index (NSCI) de la E-Governance Academy de Estonia. En la quinta secci\u00f3n se presenta el contexto de la ciberseguridad en Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe, seg\u00fan estudios realizados por el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID) y la Organizaci\u00f3n de los Estados Americanos (OEA), as\u00ed como firmas privadas de ciberseguridad. En la sexta, se presenta de manera breve dos estudios de caso de M\u00e9xico, del bienio 2019-2020, que representan la falta de madurez de su ENCS y desarrollo de ciber capacidades, aspecto que comparte con la mayor\u00eda de los pa\u00edses de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe.

Cybercriminals started phishing campaigns using social engineering and COVID19 related issues. They have created fake online resources and content with the aim to infect users and spread malware. During the pandemic, phishing attacks increased significantly and became dominant. Cybercriminals use e-mail as the main source of malware, they also actively create fake online resources and applications that are as close as possible to real sought-after and up-to-date content. Not only the activity of cybercriminals for financial gain was revealed as one of the motives of cyber-attacks, but political purposes play a big part in it also. The number of attacks increased in all sectors, including governments, industry, healthcare, service providers, critical infrastructure, and consumers.

Thus, cybersecurity management became a challenging problem, due to an apparent lack of minimum standards requirements and to diculty for the majority of the organizations to implement such processes because of their business design and cost perspectives. One way to solve this costs' issue could be through a more holistic view about managing risks integrating a major concern with the firms' intellectual capital. Considering this subject, and although its importance, little research has been carried out in Management studies, so, in this sense, the purpose of this study is to provide a systematic literature review focusing on cybersecurity management, intellectual capital and trust in order to characterize the overall dynamics of academic publications based on a set of valuable information such as: (1) authorship patterns (author productivity and geographic affiliation) (2) type of publication (3) the citations used per article and (4) a co-citation map. A systematic literature review is conducted in order to characterize the overall dynamics of academic publications identifying the practices, concepts and relationships. A Bibliometric Analysis is applied based on articles present in the ISI Web of Science and 87 studies were found distributed by 64 journal titles. Within these 64 journals, the European Conference on Intellectual Capital (ECIC) proceedings have contributed with nearly 30% of the results. A total of 105 authors published their works since 1999, at which 70% contributed with just one publication. In terms of countries, the list is leading by USA, Finland and Romania verifying a large geographic polarization. The results reflect: (1) a pattern of publications' behaviour in terms of polarization and dimension; (2) a gap in the literature, pointing therefore a way to explore and (3) the need of empirical studies in this field. The nature of this study reflects itself an originality, either by the relationship between these three concepts or by the applied methodology.

Despite being ubiquitous around the world, cyber technology is still seen as an enigma by many, mainly due to its rapid development and high level of science involved with it. In addition to the existing complexities of the technology, the level of threat matrix surrounding the cyber domain further lead to various misconceptions and exaggerations apart from elevating the complexity to a few notches above. It is evident that the world in the future is going to be fully dependent on the cyber technology and hence humans are forced to understand this complex domain in order to survive and evolve successfully as 'technological' beings. It is in this context of understanding the enigma around the cyber domain, the book attempts to analyse and disentangle the various issues related to cyber technology. The book also attempts to unravel the various threats that terrorise the cyber world in detail by categorising them according to the perpetrators. The book aims to decrypt the cyber domain and at the same time exhibit the realities in terms of the threat vector, technological sophistication and the rapid development of the domain itself. The book also tries to present the existing reality of cyber environment in India and charts out a few recommendations and suggestions for enhancing the country's cyber security architecture. The eight chapters of the book attempts to decipher the cyber world through detailed analysis of the various issues like hacking, dark web, cyber enabled terrorism, covert cyber capabilities of countries like the US and China apart from studying the cyber environment of India.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59283919, "asset_id": 33321213, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3365740, "first_name": "Dr. E.", "last_name": "Dilipraj", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "EDilipraj", "display_name": "Dr. E.

on whether and how the Internet can protect and foster human rights has become a defining issue of our time. This debate often focuses on Internet governance from a regulatory perspective, underestimating the influence and power of the governance of the Internet's architecture. The technical decisions made by Internet Standard Developing Organisations (SDOs) that build and maintain the technical infrastructure of the Internet influences how information flows. They rearrange the shape of the technically mediated public sphere, including which rights it protects and which practices it enables. In this article, we contribute to the debate on SDOs' ethical responsibility to bring their work in line with human rights. We defend three theses. First, SDOs' work is inherently political. Second, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), one of the most influential SDOs, has a moral obligation to ensure its work is coherent with, and fosters, human rights. Third, the IETF should enable the actualisation of human rights through the protocols and standards it designs by implementing a responsibility-by-design approach to engineering.

Security practitioners need IoT network traffic data to develop and assess network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Emulating realistic network traffic will avoid the costly physical deployment of thousands of smart devices. From an attacker's perspective, generating network traffic that mimics the legitimate behavior of a device can be useful to evade NIDS. As network traffic data consist of sequences of packets, the problem is similar to the generation of sequences of categorical data, like word by word text generation. Many solutions in the field of natural language processing have been proposed to adapt a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate sequences of categorical data. In this paper, we propose to combine an autoencoder with a GAN to generate sequences of packet sizes that correspond to bidirectional flows. First, the autoencoder is trained to learn a latent representation of the real sequences of packet sizes. A GAN is then trained on the latent space, to learn to generate latent vectors that can be decoded into realistic sequences. For experimental purposes, bidirectional flows produced by a Google Home Mini are used, and the autoencoder is combined with a Wassertein GAN. Comparison of different network characteristics shows that our proposed approach is able to generate sequences of packet sizes that behave closely to real bidirectional flows. We also show that the synthetic bidirectional flows are close enough to the real ones that they can fool anomaly detectors into labeling them as legitimate.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65445070, "asset_id": 44921043, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 94178659, "first_name": "Mustafizur", "last_name": "SHAHID", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MustafizurSHAHID", "display_name": "Mustafizur SHAHID", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MustafizurSHAHID?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3703, "name": "Network Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Network_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4252, "name": "Computer Networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Networks?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9135, "name": "The Internet of Things", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Internet_of_Things?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14725, "name": "Internet of Things", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_of_Things?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 53361, "name": "Computer Networking and Telecommunication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Networking_and_Telecommunication?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 81182, "name": "Deep Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deep_Learning?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 247799, "name": "Internet of Things (IoT)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_of_Things_IoT_?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 663354, "name": "Network Traffic Generation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Network_Traffic_Generation?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2655288, "name": "Generative Adversarial Networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Generative_Adversarial_Networks?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2923414, "name": "generative adversarial networks (GANs)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/generative_adversarial_networks_GANs_?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 44334381, "title": "Education -Relationships -Play Multifaceted Aspects of the Internet and Child and Youth Online Safety", "created_at": "2020-10-20T05:03:07.221-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44334381/Education_Relationships_Play_Multifaceted_Aspects_of_the_Internet_and_Child_and_Youth_Online_Safety?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_44334381", "summary": "This publication presents both risks and opportunities brought about by the Internet.

On the other hand the practitioners believed that the pension industry in Nigeria is over regulated and that it becomes very difficult to do any reasonable investment to make a difference among the PFAs. \n\nThe question on investment limits and its effects on pension portfolio and the operational income of a PFA were examined. The findings show that investment limits affected the portfolio composition and performance of the pension funds and the operational income of the PFAs.  \n\nThe regulator justifying the regulation put forward the argument that government is the final bearer of the burden of the shortfall of investment when they go bad. However, operators believed that regulation may lead to underperformance.

Among them, ridesharing has received substantial attention from decision makers around the world. Because of the multitude of currently understood or potentially unknown risks associated with ridesharing (unemployment, information privacy, environmental risk due to increased emissions, liability), governments in different countries have adopted diverse strategies in coping with risks associated with ridesharing. In some countries or municipalities, ridesharing is prohibited. In other countries, ridesharing, however, received strong support from governments. In this article, we address the question how are risks involved in ridesharing governed over time. To answer this question, we present a single in-depth case on Singapore and examine how the Singaporean government has addressed risks in ridesharing over time.

This paper explores the history of our conceptions of cyberspace, from the enthusiastic utopias culminating in the so-called \" declaration of independence of cyberspace \" to the technological underpinnings and the legislative steps being taken by today's governments to assert more control. It will address efforts in the West and East to resolve diverse, multi-faceted, and ongoing challenges that range from supporting open cyberspace to being able to heavily monitor the threat activities and the various state and non-state actors operating in cyberspace. The paper will highlight the technical and regulatory difficulties in establishing borders in cyberspace, as well as the corresponding policy consequences, and reveal how actors are evading borders by using various techniques such as cryptography and data havens, to name a few. The main takeaway is that the balkanization of cyberspace is not only a reality, but also a course that may be too difficult to reverse, and raises the question of how do open societies balance sovereignty with individual freedoms in cyberspace? A proposal is offered, drawing from examples in which the sovereignty of nation-states is limited and in which borders are not a factor, such as the international body of law regulating global commons.

This has the attendant effect of fostering future fissures in the EU\u2019s overall engagement with China.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 90736237, "asset_id": 49219420, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3260977, "first_name": "Reza", "last_name": "Hasmath", "domain_name": "ualberta", "page_name": "RezaHasmath", "display_name": "Reza Hasmath", "profile_url": "https://ualberta.academia.edu/RezaHasmath?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3260977/1075954/39403696/s65_reza.hasmath.jpg"}, {"id": 64794878, "first_name": "Una Aleksandra", "last_name": "B\u0113rzi\u0146a-\u010cerenkova", "domain_name": "rsu-lv", "page_name": "UnaAleksandraBerzinaCerenkova", "display_name": "Una Aleksandra B\u0113rzi\u0146a-\u010cerenkova", "profile_url": "https://rsu-lv.academia.edu/UnaAleksandraBerzinaCerenkova?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/64794878/16849102/17165691/s65_una_aleksandra.berzina-cerenkova.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3376, "name": "Values", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Values?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16240, "name": "Chinese Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Politics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27137, "name": "European Union Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/European_Union_Politics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52920, "name": "Institutionalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Institutionalism?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 533573, "name": "Realpolitik", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Realpolitik?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 750836, "name": "Huawei", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Huawei?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 49044544, "title": "Cyber Personhood", "created_at": "2021-05-25T12:44:10.983-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49044544/Cyber_Personhood?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_49044544", "summary": "In early 2020, the rapid adoption of remote working and communications tools by governments, companies, and individuals around the world increased dependency on cyber infrastructure for the normal functioning of States, businesses, and societies. For some, the urgent need to communicate whilst safeguarding human life took priority over ensuring that these communications tools were secure and resilient. But as these tools become firmly embedded in everyday life worldwide, the question arises whether they should be considered as critical infrastructure, or perhaps even something more important.\n\nIn a number of States, the critical importance of the environment for preservation of human life has been recognised by extending legal personhood \u2013 and thus, legal rights \u2013 to environmental entities. Countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, New Zealand, and India have granted legal rights to various rivers, lakes, parks, and nature in general. This paper explores the future possibility and cases where States may consider granting legal rights to other non-sentient but critically important entities. Looking into a future where human life becomes increasingly dependent upon highly interdependent systems in cyberspace, is there a possibility that these systems are granted personhood?\n\nRemote work and its cybersecurity implications could lead to an entirely new recognition of the importance of cyberspace dependencies and, consequently, a new legal treatment. Against the backdrop of extended debate on the legal regulation of cyberspace, including the law of armed conflict, this would raise even more complex legal considerations, especially in the light of cross-border dependencies and systems that affect multiple jurisdictions.\n\nBy way of cyber biomimicry, this paper adopts a blue-sky conceptual approach to studying policy considerations and potential implications if highly interdependent cyber systems in the distant future are granted the same protections as elements of the environment.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67429260, "asset_id": 49044544, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 257331, "first_name": "Keir", "last_name": "Giles", "domain_name": "conflictstudies", "page_name": "KeirGiles", "display_name": "Keir Giles", "profile_url": "https://conflictstudies.academia.edu/KeirGiles?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/257331/197752/31563098/s65_keir.giles.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1759, "name": "Internet Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_Studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11470, "name": "Cyberculture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberculture?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16820, "name": "Legal Personality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Legal_Personality?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 36781, "name": "Biomimicry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biomimicry?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 96546, "name": "Cyber Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 45174532, "title": "A Novel Perspective on Cyber Attribution", "created_at": "2021-02-23T01:46:57.558-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45174532/A_Novel_Perspective_on_Cyber_Attribution?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_45174532", "summary": "In today's world, determining attribution is an integral part of defending data, systems, and networks especially if an organization seeks a quick, accurate, and impactful incident response. Knowing one's adversary entails using the proper tools, techniques, and procedures to counter attacks; however, with advances in technology, skills, and complacent partners, determining one's adversary is becoming ever more difficult. Therefore, our paper addresses this critical problem of assigning attribution in cyberspace. The United States Army Intelligence and Security Command and Army Cyber Command have the unique mission to defend the Army, in particular, and lead the entire Department of Defense, in general, in cyberspace. Jointly these organizations seek to understand the threat from and conduct cyber operations against our adversaries. Determining attacker origin and identity and responding appropriately, albeit a challenge, are essential to achieve mission success and continue as a global leader in defending cyberspace. This paper explores current methods and frameworks for assigning attribution in cyberspace. We use the definition of cyber attribution as knowing the identity of name, alias, location, and/or network address of the attacker. We seek to understand which, if any, are best suited for enabling a quick, accurate, and impactful response. First, the general history of, dichotomous views about, and importance of attribution are explored. Next, a cyber-attack categorization and two methods of assigning confidence levels are examined. These vary among different nations. Next, several ways to determine attribution are discussed including both traditional, such as logs, honeypots, filtering, stream matching, and intrusion detection, as well as newer methodologies, such as packet marking, human intelligence, and diplomacy. Lastly, we explore the value of tools to assist in attribution using the DIAMOND, linear regression, association analysis, and Internet address visualization methods. We conclude with a novel perspective on this dilemma and move towards helping others overcome this difficult issue of assigning attribution today and into the future.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65758117, "asset_id": 45174532, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 138119929, "first_name": "R.", "last_name": "Morgan", "domain_name": "umgc", "page_name": "RonMorgan", "display_name": "R.

With the area of multilateral governance having the nature of being \u201cauthority-legitimation link\u201d based, the actual practices of global governance are needed to be legitimated by both the addressed governments and non-state actors (Zurn, p.62) . One way to do this is through a social process in which legitimacy beliefs are produced and then accepted by member states in global governance through a well-reasoned justification. The EU has shown its \u201cNormative Power\u201d through its efforts to promote international rules as the supposed guardian of multilateralism (Ian Manners, 2002). However, despite the cohesiveness of its actions, contestations from both outside (third party states) and inside (member states of the EU) have steadily been on a rise, hence, increased support from the middle powers are crucial to protect and promote current the multilateral governance currently put forth by the EU.

From this comparison we produced four main conclusions. First, the absence of an effective public policy for cybersecurity and cyber defence in the United States left the country vulnerable to Russian cyber-attacks that influenced the course of the 2016 Presidential Election. Second, the Cybersecurity Act of 2012, which was supported by Barack Obama, who was President at the time, would have increased US protection against cyber-attacks. However, the bill did not become law because it was defeated in the US Senate. Third, if Brazil had enacted legislation similar to the Cybersecurity Act of 2012, the country would have prevented most of the fake news and cyber-attacks that occurred in its own 2018 Presidential Election. Fourth, the main initiatives of the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 can still be implemented by both the United States and Brazil.

Recently, the World Health Organization was the target of attacks and the FBI issued a warning of increased fraud schemes related to the pandemic.\n\nFortunately, the insurance industry has been preparing for the cyber risks of the future and a modern cyber insurance policy can address the very risks that have risen to the top of mind for many companies today: operational and security risk.\n\nCyber-insurance is a specialty lines insurance product intended to protect businesses, and individuals providing services for such businesses, from Internet-based risks, and more generally from risks relating to information technology infrastructure, information privacy, information governance liability, and activities related thereto. Risks of this nature are typically excluded from traditional commercial general liability policies or at least are not specifically defined in traditional insurance products.\n\nA good first step is to create a cyber risk profile for your company and to create a list of expenses you want to have covered in the event of an incident.

Concerns have focused on the reluctance of States to agree cyber-specific multilateral treaties and to publicly clarify the customary international rules applicable to hostile cyber operations. \n\nTaking these concerns as its point of departure, this paper argues for greater specificity in evaluating the silence of States in the cyber context by distinguishing between three distinct types of peacetime security threats: cyber attacks, cyber espionage, and cyber information operations. Cyber attacks and cyber espionage are technical security threats which involve breaking into and targeting information and communications technologies. The primary distinction between the two is in the nature of the payload to be executed\udbff\udc0d while a cyber attack\udbff\udc0es payload is destructive, a cyber espionage payload ac\udbff\udc0fuires information non-destructively. Cyber information operations are content-based security threats which involve harnessing the power of online information to cognitively target human intelligence. \n\nRelying on this typology, this paper highlights how State silences concerning the application of international law to peacetime cyber operations are not uniform, but vary in terms of their targets, scope and rationale depending on the particular security threat under examination. It is suggested that these variations not only reveal an important dimension of the politics of international law, but are also salient to how the silence of States in different cyber contexts may be evaluated. Contrary to the tendency to automatically cast State silences in a negative light, this paper reveals that silences can perform different and sometimes constructive functions that are yet to be fully acknowledged or appreciated.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59892161, "asset_id": 39717693, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4122371, "first_name": "Barrie", "last_name": "Sander", "domain_name": "leidenuni", "page_name": "BarrieSander", "display_name": "Barrie Sander", "profile_url": "https://leidenuni.academia.edu/BarrieSander?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4122371/1596879/16504015/s65_barrie.sander.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 982, "name": "Cyberlaw", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberlaw?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2169, "name": "Human Rights Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights_Law?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2575, "name": "International Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Law?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2783, "name": "Privacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Privacy?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 3661, "name": "Sovereignty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sovereignty?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 5321, "name": "International Human Rights Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Human_Rights_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 7560, "name": "Public International Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_International_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 14200, "name": "Freedom Of Expression", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Freedom_Of_Expression?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 17123, "name": "Democracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democracy?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 18086, "name": "Information operations (IO)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_operations_IO_?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 20366, "name": "Elections", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Elections?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 25774, "name": "State Responsibility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/State_Responsibility?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 96546, "name": "Cyber Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 112987, "name": "Espionage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Espionage?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 347292, "name": "State sovereignty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/State_sovereignty?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 38606042, "title": "Ragazzi E., Stefanini A., 2019, Are security standards for electricity infrastructure a good choice for Europe?

The second direction suggests that urban assemblages and actor-networks require a more explicit vocabulary for thinking about competition and cooperation within and between cities. To this end, the paper introduces a new concept \u2013 delayed asymmetric counterforces \u2013 that can foster a better understanding of competition-induced urban change and destabilization. The novel concept is developed in conjunction with a typology of delays in competitive urban dynamics, which helps illuminate how delayed asymmetric counterforces are both a cause and an effect of the complexity inherent in the urban realm.

In other words, can one say in, Fukuyama's terms, that wireless technology decrees 'the end of history' for structured cabling? This paper defends an opposite hypothesis, and specifically for the Defense Studies, asserts that the emergence of the so-called cyberwarfare makes structured cabling a driving force for strategic thinking about Brazil's development. Thus, the general objective of this paper is to present structu-red cabling as a niche to be better thought by the Brazilian industrial defense base (IDB).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52709792, "asset_id": 32526259, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 674233, "first_name": "Gills", "last_name": "Vilar-Lopes", "domain_name": "fab", "page_name": "GillsVilarLopes", "display_name": "Gills Vilar-Lopes", "profile_url": "https://fab.academia.edu/GillsVilarLopes?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/674233/1503715/18050152/s65_gills.vilar_lopes.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1141517, "name": "Cabeamento Estruturado", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cabeamento_Estruturado?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1141518, "name": "Seguran\u00e7a Cibern\u00e9tica", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Seguranca_Cibernetica?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 31805570, "title": "Kiberbiztons\u00e1gi Strat\u00e9gia 2.0 A kiberbiztons\u00e1g strat\u00e9giai ir\u00e1ny\u00edt\u00e1s\u00e1nak k\u00e9rd\u00e9sei", "created_at": "2017-03-10T08:30:18.298-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31805570/Kiberbiztons%C3%A1gi_Strat%C3%A9gia_2_0_A_kiberbiztons%C3%A1g_strat%C3%A9giai_ir%C3%A1ny%C3%ADt%C3%A1s%C3%A1nak_k%C3%A9rd%C3%A9sei?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_31805570", "summary": "Manaps\u00e1g egyre ink\u00e1bb k\u00f6zhelynek sz\u00e1m\u00edt, hogy a h\u00e1l\u00f3zat alap\u00fa inform\u00e1ci\u00f3s rendszerek l\u00e9tfontoss\u00e1g\u00fa szerepet j\u00e1tszanak t\u00e1rsadalmunkban.

If knowledge on this topic is delivered in the form of a digital game-based activity, then it has greater chances of being more joyful and efficient. The paper at hand discusses the development of a novel mobile app called Cyber-Aware, destined to cybersecurity education and awareness. At present, the game is designed for K-6 aged children and can be used to support either or both formal or informal learning. Also, due to its mobile nature, it can be experienced as an outdoor or classroom activity. Opposite to similar studies found in the literature so far, our attention is not solely drawn to game's technological aspects but equally to the educational factor.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45428990, "asset_id": 20096198, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5427295, "first_name": "Filippos", "last_name": "Giannakas", "domain_name": "aegean", "page_name": "FilipposGiannakas", "display_name": "Filippos D Giannakas", "profile_url": "https://aegean.academia.edu/FilipposGiannakas?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5427295/10529938/11751156/s65_filippos.giannakas.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3018, "name": "Motivation (Psychology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Motivation_Psychology_?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3668, "name": "Student Motivation And Engagement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_Motivation_And_Engagement?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15076, "name": "Digital Games", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Games?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24113, "name": "Mobile Game-based Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobile_Game-based_Learning?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 108819, "name": "Digital Game Based Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Game_Based_Learning?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 164525, "name": "Mobile games", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobile_games?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 19974935, "title": "Intrusion Detection Systems: A Novel Multi-Agent Specification Method", "created_at": "2016-01-03T00:35:27.967-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19974935/Intrusion_Detection_Systems_A_Novel_Multi_Agent_Specification_Method?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_19974935", "summary": "Abstract - Intrusion detection systems play a major role in information systems security. However, the complexity of a network flow can cause the outbreak of numerous false alarms, commonly called false positives or cannot detect malicious traffic, i.e. false negatives.

E-commerce represents a good reason for criminals or attackers to be diverted to profit law. Recently, the attackers used botnets to achieve their goals. A comprehensive study of botnet is done in this paper , study a life cycle of botnet, the attack on the behavior, topologies and technologies of botnet, studied of Zeus robots (An ethical penetration operation has been done using Zeus botnet version 1.2.7.19 and using Zeus version 2.0.8.9) were is done in in detail to determine its characteristics, and be able to detect it in the computers on the Internet. Host Botnet Detection Software (HBD's) is designed and implemented to detect Zeus botnet in user\u2019s computers. The HDB's depends on information obtained from studying Zeus in addition to information obtained from analysis (an analysis of Zeus bot has been done by using reverse engineering tool (Ollydbg reverse engineering tool)) and penetration operation. In order to remove Zeus botnet from victim computers. \n\nKeywords - Zeus, Host Botnet Detection Software (HBDS), Botnet, Ollydbg reverse engineering tool, Zeus botnet version 1.2.7.19 and using Zeus

Indeed, this trend will allow companies to benefit from considerable productivity thanks to the dematerialization of resources to the cloud and the adoption of new technologies such as AI, Big Data, IoT. In this context, attacks linked to digitization are multiplying and becoming more and more sophisticated. One of the critical sectors requiring urgent digital transformation is industry, without this transformation, companies lose their competitiveness. Considering this need, cyber-attacks aimed at industrial networks have become increasingly developed.

This work examines the role of human factors in cybersecurity by looking at the top-tier conference on Human Factors in Cybersecurity over the past 6 years. A total of 24 articles were selected for the final analysis. Findings show that most of the authors used a quantitative method, where survey was the most used tool for collecting the data, and less attention has been paid to the theoretical research. Besides, three types of users were identified: university-level users, organizationallevel users, and unspecified users. Culture is another less investigated aspect, and the samples were biased towards the western community. Moreover, 17 human factors are identified; human awareness, privacy perception, trust perception, behavior, and capability are the top five among them. Also, new insights and recommendations are presented.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84051976, "asset_id": 76303724, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 123645252, "first_name": "Rohani", "last_name": "Rohan", "domain_name": "kmutnb", "page_name": "RohaniRohan", "display_name": "Rohani Rohan", "profile_url": "https://kmutnb.academia.edu/RohaniRohan?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/123645252/35102028/62791630/s65_rohani.rohan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2783, "name": "Privacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Privacy?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7125, "name": "Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2899136, "name": "Cyberattack", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberattack?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 74881718, "title": "The Carrier Wave Principle", "created_at": "2022-03-29T06:39:14.751-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/74881718/The_Carrier_Wave_Principle?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_74881718", "summary": "In this article, we propose a new theoretical lens through which to explore the relationship between sociotechnical artifacts, the messages they convey, and the cultural meanings derived from them.

You can probably surmise the answer to this question once you've successfully answered most of the questions we cover below. In today's threat landscape, you need to be able to handle security incidents and events with a welldocumented strategy and process. It also helps to practice handling data breaches with your team during regular tabletop security exercises. These exercises help your team gauge and improve the ability to handle security incidents and data breaches in the future. 2. Do we incorporate 'privacy by design' into our IT systems? If you take a 'privacy by design' approach to security, you approach your security projects by incorporating privacy and data protection from the start. Leveraging this approach helps your organization when complying with global data privacy regulations. Consider incorporating 'privacy by design' when: \uf0b7 Deploying any new IT infrastructure that stores or processes personal data \uf0b7 Implementing new security policies or strategies \uf0b7 Sharing any data with third parties or customers \uf0b7 Using data for any analytical purposes By incorporating 'privacy by design,' you are helping to minimize the risk of data loss. If you design your projects, processes, and systems with privacy in mind, you can identify problems early on and raise the level of awareness for privacy concerns in the organization. 3. Have we conducted a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)? A PIA is a beneficial tool used to identify and reduce the risk of poor privacy practices in your organization. These assessments reduce your risk of mishandling personal data. Key stakeholders are involved in a PIA interview which results in identifying potential privacy problems and offers recommendations on how to address challenges. Ultimately, a PIA will help an organization and security team develop better policies and systems for handling sensitive personal data.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 75688634, "asset_id": 63179760, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2363014, "first_name": "ALI", "last_name": "MOULAEI NEJAD", "domain_name": "uni-mysore", "page_name": "ALIMOULAEINEJAD", "display_name": "ALI MOULAEI NEJAD", "profile_url": "https://uni-mysore.academia.edu/ALIMOULAEINEJAD?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2363014/744683/18272526/s65_ali.moulaei_nejad.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 9642, "name": "Cyberjournalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberjournalism?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9872, "name": "Tcp/Ip", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tcp_Ip?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 175942, "name": "DNS system", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/DNS_system?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 185726, "name": "Network Monitoring and Measurements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Network_Monitoring_and_Measurements?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 522782, "name": "Information Technology and System Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Technology_and_System_Integration?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 567065, "name": "Ip Address", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ip_Address?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1163297, "name": "Detecting and Preventing the Malicious System based on DNS Analsi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Detecting_and_Preventing_the_Malicious_System_based_on_DNS_Analsi?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2838921, "name": "Cyber-technical systems risk assessment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber-technical_systems_risk_assessment?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 62388989, "title": "An empirical study of ransomware attacks on organizations: an assessment of severity and salient factors affecting vulnerability", "created_at": "2021-11-25T12:51:48.657-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/62388989/An_empirical_study_of_ransomware_attacks_on_organizations_an_assessment_of_severity_and_salient_factors_affecting_vulnerability?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_62388989", "summary": "This study looks at the experiences of organizations that have fallen victim to ransomware attacks.

Specifically, if the UK scales up and internationalizes its Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Center, perhaps by creating an International Cyber Security Evaluation Center, it can lead its allies and the world in 5G, 6G, cybersecurity, and international relations, filling a vital leadership vacuum.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63867524, "asset_id": 43559692, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 99151987, "first_name": "Grant", "last_name": "Turner", "domain_name": "iwp", "page_name": "GrantTurner", "display_name": "Grant W Turner", "profile_url": "https://iwp.academia.edu/GrantTurner?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/99151987/45213803/35332945/s65_grant.turner.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 735, "name": "International Economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Economics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 851, "name": "Complex Systems Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Complex_Systems_Science?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1164, "name": "Democracy and Cyber-Democracy Theory and Practice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democracy_and_Cyber-Democracy_Theory_and_Practice?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2052, "name": "Intelligence Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intelligence_Studies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 5523, "name": "Security Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_Studies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 36997, "name": "Emerging Technologies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emerging_Technologies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 37996, "name": "Supply Chain Risk Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Supply_Chain_Risk_Management?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 96546, "name": "Cyber Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 278685, "name": "Telecommunications Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Telecommunications_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 298344, "name": "Antitrust & Competition Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Antitrust_and_Competition_Law?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 454639, "name": "5g Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/5g_Technology?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 659210, "name": "US UK special relationship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/US_UK_special_relationship?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 750836, "name": "Huawei", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Huawei?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1278637, "name": "5G Mobile Communications", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/5G_Mobile_Communications?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1374105, "name": "5g Network", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/5g_Network?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 3092936, "name": "cybersecurity workforce diversity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/cybersecurity_workforce_diversity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 3667345, "name": "6G ", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/6G?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 43134135, "title": "The Next Generation of Cyber-Enabled Information Warfare", "created_at": "2020-05-22T01:41:56.937-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43134135/The_Next_Generation_of_Cyber_Enabled_Information_Warfare?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_43134135", "summary": "Malign influence campaigns leveraging cyber capabilities have caused significant political disruption in the United States and elsewhere; but the next generation of campaigns could be considerably more damaging as a result of the widespread use of machine learning. Current methods for successfully waging these campaigns depend on labour-intensive human interaction with targets. The introduction of machine learning, and potentially artificial intelligence (AI), will vastly enhance capabilities for automating the reaching of mass audiences with tailored and plausible content. Consequently, they will render malicious actors even more powerful. Tools for making use of machine learning in information operations are developing at an extraordinarily rapid pace, and are becoming rapidly more available and affordable for a much wider variety of users. Until early 2018 it was assumed that the utilisation of AI methods by cyber criminals was not to be expected soon, because those methods rely on vast datasets, correspondingly vast computational power, or both, and demanded highly specialised skills and knowledge. However, in 2019 these assumptions proved invalid, as datasets and computing power were democratised and freely available tools obviated the need for special skills. It is reasonable to assume that this process will continue, transforming the landscape of deception, disinformation and influence online. This article assesses the state of AI-enhanced cyber and information operations in late 2019 and investigates whether this may represent the beginnings of substantial and dangerous trends over the next decade.

This invariably has a security concern for the payload as the traffic on IP based voice networks is exposed to threats similar to those found on regular data traffic. Realising end-to-end security has been influenced by numerous exploits targeted at VoIP networks with attendant lower rate of calls than the traditional telephone system. Although the requirements for security as well as accessibility for voice traffic are dissimilar as compared to data traffic, it is equivalently significant to protect this payload from attacks such as spoofing, eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. These security concerns, due to the flexibility of the VoIP system with corresponding convergence of the voice and data networks pose a plethora of threats to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the services rendered on VoIP networks. In this paper, the various threats, vulnerabilities and attacks on VoIP networks as well as countermeasures for mitigation will be examined.

But how should a nation react to a zero day?  This question is a concern for most national governments, and one that requires a systematic approach for its resolution.  The security of critical infrastructure of nations and states have been severally violated by cybercriminals.  Nation-state espionage and the possible disruption and circumvention of the security of critical networks has been on the increase.  Most of these violations are possible through detectable operational bypasses, which are rather ignored by security administrators.  One common instance of a detectable operational bypass is the non-application of periodic security updates and upgrades from software and hardware vendors.  Every software is not necessarily in its final state, and the application of periodic updates allow for the patching of vulnerable systems, making them to be secure enough to withstand an exploit.  To have control over the security of critical national assets, a nation must be \u201ccyber-ready\u201d through the proper management of vulnerabilities and the deployment of the rightful technology in the cyberspace for hunting, detecting and preventing cyberattacks and espionage.  To this effect, this paper discusses the implications of zero day exploits and highlights the dangers posed by this cankerworm for an unprepared nation.

This paper explores imagination and imaginational intelligence as the core for artificial intelligence and human intelligence. The key idea and motive behind it is that imagination is the source of every creation and innovation. This paper examines the foundations of imaginational intelligence (philosophical, mathematical and computational). It proposes a spectrum of imaginational intelligence. It also looks at its impacts on data science, business intelligence and artificial intelligence with applications. The approach proposed in the presentation will facilitate the research and development of imaginational intelligence, artificial intelligence and human intelligence and business intelligence as well as imagination science, technology and engineering.

The priority is the security of information systems and networks, rather than the protection of connected users. The dominance of war metaphors in the cyber security debates has produced a security dilemma, which is not sufficiently addressing the needs of people. This article underlines this shortcoming and views cyber security through a human-centric perspective. Freedom of expression and the right to privacy are under attack in the era of cyber surveillance. From a human-centric perspective such rights should be understood as a critical part of cyber security. Human rights protections need to be effectively addressed in the digital sphere and gain their place in the cyber security agendas.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45747712, "asset_id":

purpose of this essay is to demonstrate how the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation found itself leading the efforts against cyber-threats, including cybercrime, cyber espionage but, above all, preparing itself an its country-members to a new type of conflict: the cyber warfare. Should it happen, the Atlantic Alliance has already discussed important points \u2014 for example, if the collective defense mechanism should apply or not to the cyber domain. In order to achieve that, the work has been divided into four chapters. The first introduces the theme and explains the methodology used in the research. The second chapter gives a theoretical approach about international security and cybersecurity in general, necessary to a good understanding of the theme. The third chapter describes the main events involving cyber-attacks with relevance to the international politics. Finally, the last and main chapter addresses directly the decisions made within NATO to assure cybersecurity, including the creation of the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCoE) and the publishing of the \u201cTallinn Manual of International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d, among others.\n\n\nKeywords: Collective security, Cybersecurity, NATO, North Atlantic Treaty

As can be seen from reports on the situation in Poland, there are increasing signs of hostility to religion, stereotyping, and discrimination.

The key principle of the Russian approach to information warfare, including cyber activities, is that information is the most important object of operations, independent of the channel through which it is transmitted. The aim is to control-or weaponize-information in whatever form it takes. Thus, &amp;quot;cyber&amp;quot; in particular is just a technical representation of information. In short, in Russia&amp;#39;s comprehensive approach to the information domain, cyber is not a stand-alone discipline. This principle underpins all Russian efforts to extract, exfiltrate, manipulate, distort, or insert information. Alongside cyber activities, the channels available for doing this are as diverse as using fake or real news media to plant disinformation, trolling campaigns, issuing official government statements, giving speeches at rallies or demonstrations, posting defamatory online videos, and sending direct text messages. Russian information activities are not limited to cyberspace. Rather than using the term &amp;quot;cyberspace,&amp;quot; Russian officials refer to &amp;quot;information space,&amp;quot; which includes both computer and human information processing. This essay starts with an explanation of the terminological, doctrinal, and practical distinguishing features of Russian cyber activities as part of information warfare. It goes on to look at a number of Russia&amp;#39;s agencies and capabilities involved in the prosecution of cyber activities, both offensive and defensive. In conclusion, the essay emphasizes the main implication of this distinctive approach: the need for nations to prepare a broad range of defenses against Russia&amp;#39;s holistic approach to offensive cyber, information warfare, and other forms of hostile online activity.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 257331, "first_name": "Keir", "last_name": "Giles", "domain_name": "conflictstudies", "page_name": "KeirGiles", "display_name": "Keir Giles", "profile_url": "https://conflictstudies.academia.edu/KeirGiles?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/257331/197752/31563098/s65_keir.giles.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 389, "name": "Russian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian_Studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2674, "name": "Intelligence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intelligence?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4810, "name": "Information Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Warfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 11337, "name": "Cyber Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Warfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 20694, "name": "Internet politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_politics?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 41863, "name": "Russia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russia?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 62551, "name": "Internet and politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_and_politics?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 346639, "name": "Intelligence and security studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intelligence_and_security_studies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 831496, "name": "Cybersecurity policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity_policy?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 70219471, "title": "Cybersecurity as praxis and as a state : The EU law path towards acknowledgement of a new right to cybersecurity", "created_at": "2022-02-01T07:10:35.868-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/70219471/Cybersecurity_as_praxis_and_as_a_state_The_EU_law_path_towards_acknowledgement_of_a_new_right_to_cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_70219471", "summary": "The end of the second decade of the 21st century has been the best of times for EU's cybersecurity law and policy: Its NIS Directive has been transposed into all Member States' national law, creating a new administrative structure at EU and Member State level and mandating relevant policies and strategies to update and harmonise those that were already in place. Its Cybersecurity Act of 2019 incorporated the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), and promises to install a new European cybersecurity certification scheme. To support policy with funding, large sums of research money have been spent on the development of cybersecurity tools and the relevant framework. However, EU's significant regulatory activity is faced with substantial difficulties. While cybersecurity concerns are placed high on the list of issues that worry Europeans making a regulatory response pressing, the cybersecurity theoretical framework is far from concluded: Difficulties start as early as when attempting to define the term, ultimately divulging a lack of common understanding. Different actors understand cybersecurity differently under different circumstances. A distinction that could perhaps prove useful in creating clarity as to its exact meaning would distinguish between cybersecurity as praxis and cybersecurity as a state. Cybersecurity as praxis would then be understood as the activities and measures that need to be undertaken in order to accomplish cybersecurity's aims and objectives. Accordingly, cybersecurity as a state would mean the condition that is achieved once cybersecurity as praxis has succeeded; Within cybersecurity as a state persons need to be protected against any cyber threat. A distinction between cybersecurity as praxis and cybersecurity as a state would not only be useful in delineating the term's content but could also constitute the necessary theoretical groundwork for development, ultimately, of a new right to cybersecurity. EU law has already taken positive steps towards acknowledgement of a new right to cybersecurity. However, a lot more needs to be done; Past progress needs to be continued and updated. A conceivable next step could take the form of formal acknowledgement of such a new right in EU law, in a future amendment of the Act's provisions or otherwise.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80055951, "asset_id": 70219471, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 121231809, "first_name": "Vagelis", "last_name": "Papakonstantinou", "domain_name": "vubirelec", "page_name": "VagelisPapakonstantinou", "display_name": "Vagelis Papakonstantinou", "profile_url": "https://vubirelec.academia.edu/VagelisPapakonstantinou?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/121231809/30146027/27971525/s65_vagelis.papakonstantinou.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 45687816, "title": "SPEAR SIEM: A Security Information and Event Management System for the Smart Grid", "created_at": "2021-04-06T09:53:40.390-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45687816/SPEAR_SIEM_A_Security_Information_and_Event_Management_System_for_the_Smart_Grid?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_45687816", "summary": "The technological leap of smart technologies has brought the conventional electrical grid in a new digital era called Smart Grid (SG), providing multiple benefits, such as two-way communication, pervasive control and self-healing. However, this new reality generates significant cybersecurity risks due to the heterogeneous and insecure nature of SG. In particular, SG relies on legacy communication protocols that have not been implemented having cy-bersecurity in mind. Moreover, the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) creates severe cybersecurity challenges. The Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems constitute an emerging technology in the cybersecurity area, having the capability to detect, normalise and correlate a vast amount of security events. They can orchestrate the entire security of a smart ecosystem, such as SG. Nevertheless, the current SIEM systems do not take into account the unique SG peculiarities and characteristics like the legacy communication protocols. In this paper, we present the Secure and PrivatE smArt gRid (SPEAR) SIEM, which focuses on SG. The main contribution of our work is the design and implementation of a SIEM system capable of detecting, normalising and correlating cyberattacks and anomalies against a plethora of SG application-layer protocols.

These devices have their own vulnerability issues as well as the data shared over the internet has a very good chances of getting breached. Common vulnerability issues like infecting the device with malware, Trojan, virus are on the rise. Moreover, a lack of proper cyber security policy and strategy might make the existing situation at the vulnerable edge of tipping point.

While the cybersecurity literature has focused on the practical dilemmas of providing a public good, it has been less effective in reflecting on the role of cybersecurity in the broader constitution of political order. Unpacking three accepted conceptual divisions between public and private, state and market, and the political and economic, it is possible to locate how this set of theoretical assumptions shortcut reflection on these larger issues.

To address the security and privacy challenges in VANETs, several conditional privacy-preserving authentication (CPPA) schemes based on bilinear pairing and using a tamper-proof device have been proposed. However, bilinear operation is known to be one of the most complex cryptographic operations and tamper-proof device is expensive with a very strong security assumption. In this work, we propose a CPPA scheme for VANETs without using bilin-ear pairing or any special device. The proposed scheme employs pseudo-identity-based time-bound signature and transport management center (TMC) to achieve CPPA with scala-bility in VANETs. The security analysis shows that the scheme not only satisfies all the security and privacy requirements of VANETs, but solves private key compromise problem and provides countermeasure against privilege escalation. Compared with most recent CPPA schemes for VANETs, the computation cost of message signing, single message verification and batch verification in the proposed scheme improved by 91.39%, 94.55%, and 99.60% respectively. Moreover, analysis shows that the proposed scheme has better performance in terms of communication cost than existing CPPA schemes in VANETs.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56006199, "asset_id": 36114405, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34265127, "first_name": "Sunday", "last_name": "Ogundoyin", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "OgundoyinOyinlola", "display_name": "Sunday O Ogundoyin", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/OgundoyinOyinlola?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/34265127/10042438/11202121/s65_ogundoyin.oyinlola.jpg_oh_d4c040bba51c7b56380d4cfb07b8246a_oe_566b03ec___gda___1450282553_85eb93215addba9b8994f4b5618b295b"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2345, "name": "Wireless Communications", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wireless_Communications?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2783, "name": "Privacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Privacy?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 33345464, "title": "Finardi U., Ragazzi E., Stefanini A.

While national policies intended to deter cyber aggression may offer some solution in the short term, their effects in the long term are doubtful. National cyber-deterrence policies entail the risk of an ongoing cyber arms race and a cycle of escalation between potential cyber opponents. Diplomacy may offer fewer results in the short term, but it is more promising in the long term. Confidence-building measures and international norms and values may not be easy to reach, but in the end they could be more effective (and cheaper) than a single focus on national cyber-deterrence strategies. In the long term, cooperation between states to establish confidence and commonly accepted norms of behaviour in cyber space are the most promising ways available to achieve enduring cyber security and stability. Enhancing interstate cooperation , transparency and predictability of behaviour in cyberspace will reduce the risks of misperception, escalation and conflict.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51967710, "asset_id": 31646996, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17304434, "first_name": "Sico", "last_name": "van der Meer", "domain_name": "tno", "page_name": "SicovanderMeer", "display_name": "Sico van der Meer", "profile_url": "https://tno.academia.edu/SicovanderMeer?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/17304434/4795946/5523906/s65_sico.van_der_meer.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3705, "name": "International Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 612065, "title": "Systems Security Engineering", "created_at": "2011-05-24T04:41:12.575-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/612065/Systems_Security_Engineering?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_612065", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51333413, "asset_id": 612065, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 451258, "first_name": "Jennifer", "last_name": "Bayuk", "domain_name": "stevens", "page_name": "JenniferBayuk", "display_name": "Jennifer Bayuk", "profile_url": "https://stevens.academia.edu/JenniferBayuk?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3391, "name": "Systems Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Systems_Engineering?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13923, "name": "Computer Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 58914, "name": "System Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/System_Engineering?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 84822, "name": "Security Requirements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_Requirements?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 258789, "name": "System Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/System_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2070034, "name": "Data Format", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_Format?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 29717854, "title": "Great Firewall, China", "created_at": "2016-11-07T10:47:45.083-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29717854/Great_Firewall_China?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_29717854", "summary": "Chinese authorities have regulated the Internet since the early days of the country going online.

In this paper, we propose the first statistical framework for rigorously analyzing honeypot-captured cyber attack data. The framework is built on the novel concept of stochastic cyber attack process, a new kind of mathematical objects for describing cyber attacks. To demonstrate use of the framework, we apply it to analyze a low-interaction honeypot dataset, while noting that the framework can be equally applied to analyze high-interaction honeypot data that contains richer information about the attacks. The case study finds, for the first time, that Long-Range Dependence (LRD) is exhibited by honeypot-captured cyber attacks. The case study confirms that by exploiting the statistical properties (LRD in this case), it is feasible to predict cyber attacks (at least in terms of attack rate) with good accuracy. This kind of prediction capability would provide sufficient early-warning time for defenders to adjust their defense configurations or resource allocations. The idea of \" gray-box \" (rather than \" black-box \") prediction is central to the utility of the statistical framework, and represents a significant step towards ultimately understanding (the degree of) the predictability of cyber attacks.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48961016, "asset_id": 28599105, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 53241330, "first_name": "Shouhuai", "last_name": "Xu", "domain_name": "uccs", "page_name": "ShouhuaiXu", "display_name": "Shouhuai Xu", "profile_url": "https://uccs.academia.edu/ShouhuaiXu?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/53241330/67031758/55392684/s65_shouhuai.xu.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 126300, "name": "Big Data", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Big_Data?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 289278, "name": "Big Data Analytics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Big_Data_Analytics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2531760, "name": "Science of Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_of_Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2531762, "name": "Cybersecurity Modeling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity_Modeling?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2531766, "name": "Cybersecurity Data Analytics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity_Data_Analytics?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 28599108, "title": "A Stochastic Model of Active Cyber Defense Dynamics", "created_at": "2016-09-19T07:18:26.133-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28599108/A_Stochastic_Model_of_Active_Cyber_Defense_Dynamics?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_28599108", "summary": "The concept of active cyber defense has appeared in the literature in recent years. However, there are no mathematical models for characterizing the effectiveness of active cyber defense. In this paper, we fill the void by proposing a novel Markov process model that is native to the interaction between cyber attack and active cyber defense. Unfortunately, the native Markov process model cannot be tackled by techniques of which we are aware. We therefore simplify, via mean-field approximation, the Markov process model as a dynamical system model that is amenable to analysis. This allows us to derive a set of valuable analytic results that characterize the effectiveness of four types of active cyber defense dynamics. Simulations show that the analytic results are intrinsic to the native Markov process model, and therefore justify the validity of the dynamical system model.

school children in cyberspace activities, basic cybersecurity education and awareness is deemed necessary. Within this context, knowledge acquisition in this timely and important field has greater chances to be more fruitful when the learner is properly motivated. Also, it is anticipated to be more joyful when knowledge is acquired in the form of a digital game-based activity. The paper at hand discusses the development of a novel mobile app called CyberAware, destined to cybersecurity education and awareness. At present, the game is designed for K-6 children in order to support either or both formal or informal learning. Additionally, due to its mobile characteristics, the game can be experienced as an outdoor or classroom activity. Finally, opposite to similar studies found in the literature so far, our attention is not solely drawn to game\u2019s technological aspects but equally to the educational factor. This is achieved through the consideration and use of the ARCS motivational model already from the game\u2019s design phase.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45428644, "asset_id": 25059971, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5427295, "first_name": "Filippos", "last_name": "Giannakas", "domain_name": "aegean", "page_name": "FilipposGiannakas", "display_name": "Filippos D Giannakas", "profile_url": "https://aegean.academia.edu/FilipposGiannakas?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5427295/10529938/11751156/s65_filippos.giannakas.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1763, "name": "Mobile Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobile_Learning?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4370, "name": "Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23506, "name": "Information Security and Privacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security_and_Privacy?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24113, "name": "Mobile Game-based Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobile_Game-based_Learning?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 198277, "name": "Information Privacy and Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Privacy_and_Security?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 9622330, "title": "MAPPING THE CYBER DRAGON: CHINA'S CONDUCT OF TERROR IN THE CYBER WORLD", "created_at": "2014-12-04T05:16:05.245-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9622330/MAPPING_THE_CYBER_DRAGON_CHINAS_CONDUCT_OF_TERROR_IN_THE_CYBER_WORLD?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_9622330", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35826186, "asset_id": 9622330, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3365740, "first_name": "Dr. E.", "last_name": "Dilipraj", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "EDilipraj", "display_name": "Dr. E.

Yet proper regulation of cyberstalking behaviour could have substantial impact upon the wellbeing of many victims \u2013 from child to adult. In this article, I suggest that a different from of regulation is required: one based upon a virtual, community-based concept of regulation. Such a concept offers a novel approach based on three elements fundamental to the discussion of regulation of cyberstalking: (1) the differences between physical stalking and cyberstalking; (2) the character of a virtual community and the effects of social interactions; and (3) the scope of experience and reality. This formulation is based on an expansive view of regulation and \u2018normativity\u2019 of a virtual community.

This has created a huge attack surface that requires the deployment of effective and practical countermeasures to protect network infrastructures from the harm that cyber-attacks can cause. Hence, there is an absolute need to differentiate boundaries in personal information and cloud and fog computing globally and the adoption of specific information security policies and regulations. The goal of the security policy and framework for cloud and fog computing is to protect the end-users and their information, reduce task-based operations, aid in compliance, and create standards for expected user actions, all of which are based on the use of established rules for cloud computing. Moreover, intrusion detection systems are widely adopted solutions to monitor and analyze network traffic and detect anomalies that can help identify ongoing adversarial activities, trigger alerts, and automatically block traffic from hostile sources. This survey paper analyzes factors, including the application of technologies and techniques, which can enable the deployment of security policy on fog and cloud computing successfully. The paper focuses on a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and intrusion detection, which provides an effective and resilient system structure for users and organizations. Our survey aims to provide a framework for a cloud and fog computing security policy, while addressing the required security tools, policies, and services, particularly for cloud and fog environments for organizational adoption. While developing the essential linkage between requirements, legal aspects, analyzing techniques and systems to reduce intrusion detection, we recommend the strategies for cloud and fog computing security policies. The paper develops structured guidelines for ways in which organizations can adopt and audit the security of their systems as security is an essential component of their systems and presents an agile current state-of-the-art review of intrusion detection systems and their principles. Functionalities and techniques for developing these defense mechanisms are considered, along with concrete products utilized in operational systems. Finally, we discuss evaluation criteria and open-ended challenges in this area.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82163751, "asset_id": 73773315, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 61467952, "first_name": "Paolo", "last_name": "Modesti", "domain_name": "tees", "page_name": "PaoloModesti", "display_name": "Paolo Modesti", "profile_url": "https://tees.academia.edu/PaoloModesti?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/61467952/15974966/20773027/s65_paolo.modesti.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 26860, "name": "Cloud Computing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cloud_Computing?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 119822, "name": "Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intrusion_Detection_Systems_IDSs_?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1591774, "name": "Fog Computing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fog_Computing?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 73337536, "title": "Components of Defence Strategies in Society\u2019s Information Environment: A Case Study Based on the Grounded Theory", "created_at": "2022-03-08T11:12:03.871-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/73337536/Components_of_Defence_Strategies_in_Society_s_Information_Environment_A_Case_Study_Based_on_the_Grounded_Theory?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_73337536", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81896084, "asset_id": 73337536, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51791277, "first_name": "Martti", "last_name": "Lehto", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MarttiLehto", "display_name": "Martti Lehto", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MarttiLehto?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3705, "name": "International Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13675, "name": "Grounded Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Grounded_Theory?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24624, "name": "Social Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 53441, "name": "Defence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Defence?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 57983, "name": "Societal Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Societal_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 64633, "name": "Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Society?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 307159, "name": "State Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/State_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 862339, "name": "Component", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Component?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1307638, "name": "Technical security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Technical_security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2572864, "name": "Military Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 2660652, "name": "Information Environment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Environment?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 72502533, "title": "The Big Space Cybersecurity Question: Red Team or Blue Team?", "created_at": "2022-02-26T07:07:15.649-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/72502533/The_Big_Space_Cybersecurity_Question_Red_Team_or_Blue_Team?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_72502533", "summary": "Experts in the area of space cybersecurity all agree that more needs to be done to protect valuable military and commercial space assets.

When discussing Mongolia\u2019s foreign policy and security apparatus, historians and scholars look at the international relations of East Asia as a whole. This is the case not because Mongolia\u2019s foreign policy is insignificant but because greater powers impose greater influence on smaller states. Mongolia\u2019s partial involvement in World War II (WWII), and the Cold War introduced new challenges as well as opportunities for Mongolia to modernize its foreign policy principles and security policies. In turn, this research paper offers ways to enhance and strengthen Mongolia\u2019s foreign and security policies by carefully looking at historical turning points, addressing existing issues, and providing a solution-based analysis for policymakers.

The \u201cSnowden moment\u201d has shed light on the risks that journalists and their sources face while communicating online and has shown how journalists themselves can be targets of surveillance operations or other forms of malicious digital attacks from different actors. More recent revelations, such as those coming from the \u201cPegasus Project\u201d, have underlined even more dangerous threats posed to the safety of journalists, increasingly targeted with spyware technology. Due to the sensitivity of their work and sources and given their strong \u201cwatchdog\u201d role in democracies, investigative reporters are in a particularly dangerous position when it comes to the potential chilling effects of surveillance on their work of journalists.

Well-known active defense systems are honeypots. Honeypots are fake systems, designed to look like real production systems, aimed at trapping an attacker, and analyzing his attack strategy and goals. These types of systems suffer from a major weakness: it is extremely hard to design them in such a way that an attacker cannot distinguish them from a real production system. In this paper, we advocate that, instead of adding additional fake systems in the corporate network, the production systems themselves should be instrumented to provide active defense capabilities. This perspective to active defense allows containing costs and complexity, while at the same time provides the attacker with a more realistic-looking target, and gives the Incident Response Team more time to identify the attacker. The proposed proof-of-concept prototype system can be used to implement active defense in any corporate production network, with little upfront work, and little maintenance.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 71875259, "asset_id": 56535670, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 58932615, "first_name": "Fabio", "last_name": "De Gaspari", "domain_name": "uniroma", "page_name": "FabioDeGaspari", "display_name": "Fabio De Gaspari", "profile_url": "https://uniroma.academia.edu/FabioDeGaspari?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/58932615/65734842/54075747/s65_fabio.de_gaspari.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 27223, "name": "Intelligent Agents", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intelligent_Agents?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1491214, "name": "Cyber-Deception", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber-Deception?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3089776, "name": "Active Defense", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Active_Defense?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 53106049, "title": "Precision time protocol attack strategies and their resistance to existing security extensions", "created_at": "2021-09-21T04:36:25.588-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/53106049/Precision_time_protocol_attack_strategies_and_their_resistance_to_existing_security_extensions?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_53106049", "summary": "The IEEE 1588 precision time protocol (PTP) is very important for many industrial sectors and applications that require time synchronization accuracy between computers down to microsecond and even nanosecond levels.

In 2017, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted resolution MSC.428(98) on Maritime Cyber Risk Management in Safety Management System (SMS). The Resolution stated that an approved Safety Management System SMS should take into account cyber risk management in accordance with the objectives and functional requirements of the International Safety Management (ISM) CODE. The IMO encourages administrations to ensure that cyber risks are appropriately addressed in safety management systems no later than the first annual verification of the company's Document of Compliance after 1 January 2021. This paper presents Guidelines on Cyber Security Onboard Ships that are aligned with IMO resolution MSC.428 to asses companies to identify risks arising from the use of IT and OT onboard ships and establish appropriate safeguards against cyber incidents, The aim of this study is to analyze cyber vulnerabilities of significant maritime technologies to the port facilities and on board of vessels , Evaluates the different frame works and guidelines on maritime cyber risk management to demonstrate the seriousness of maritime cyber threats for national security.

The second discourse is dominated by thinking associated with realism, taking into account the use by states of both spaces for competition (especially between powers) and treating them as additional spheres of national security. From the perspective of international security models, this leads to divergent conclusions. It seems that activities in the area of cyberspace encourage the supporters of the first-mentioned narrative to opt for the emergence of a global governance model in the near future, initiated by the institutions of the United Nations system. On the other hand, the supporters of realism lean towards a new multi-area and multi-level balance of forces, seeing a high probability of creating a similar global model including space.

from running computer displays modulates information about the picture frames being displayed on screen. Attacks have been demonstrated on eavesdropping computer displays by utilising these emissions as a side-channel vector. The accuracy of reconstructing a screen image depends on the emission sampling rate and bandwidth of the attackers signal acquisition hardware. The cost of radio frequency acquisition hardware increases with increased supported frequency range and bandwidth. A number of enthusiast-level, affordable software defined radio equipment solutions are currently available facilitating a number of radio-focused attacks at a more reasonable price point. This work investigates three accuracy influencing factors, other than the sample rate and bandwidth, namely noise removal, image blending, and image quality adjustments, that affect the accuracy of monitor image reconstruction through electromagnetic side-channel attacks.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56897327, "asset_id": 36947284, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

Typically, the creation of these challenges requires overly arduous effort on the part of the educator to ensure their viability. Once created, the challenge image needs to be stored and distributed to a class for practical training. This storage and distribution step requires significant time and resources and may not even be possible in an online/distance learning scenario due to the data sizes involved. As part of this paper, we introduce a more capable methodology and system as an alternative to current approaches. EviPlant is a system designed for the efficient creation, manipulation, storage and distribution of challenges for digital forensics education and training. The system relies on the initial distribution of base disk images, i.e., images containing solely base operating systems. In order to create challenges for students, educators can boot the base system, emulate the desired activity and perform a \" diffing \" of resultant image and the base image. This diffing process extracts the modified artefacts and associated metadata and stores them in an \" evidence package \". Evidence packages can be created for different personae, different wear-and-tear, different emulated crimes, etc., and multiple evidence packages can be distributed to students and integrated into the base images. A number of additional applications in digital forensic challenge creation for tool testing and validation, proficiency testing, and malware analysis are also discussed as a result of using EviPlant.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53139426, "asset_id": 33029269, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8277127, "first_name": "Mark", "last_name": "Scanlon", "domain_name": "ucd", "page_name": "MarkScanlon", "display_name": "Mark Scanlon", "profile_url": "https://ucd.academia.edu/MarkScanlon?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8277127/11495825/12821877/s65_mark.scanlon.jpg"}, {"id": 64349887, "first_name": "Xiaoyu", "last_name": "Du", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "XiaoyuDu3", "display_name": "Xiaoyu Du", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/XiaoyuDu3?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/64349887/17217355/17348488/s65_xiaoyu.du.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1128, "name": "Computer Science Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science_Education?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1284, "name": "Computer Forensics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Forensics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2511, "name": "Cybercrimes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrimes?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50160, "name": "Digital Forensics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Forensics?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 32904681, "title": "SECURITY ANALYSIS OF AES AND ENHANCING ITS SECURITY BY MODIFYING S-BOX WITH AN ADDITIONAL BYTE", "created_at": "2017-05-08T06:16:37.110-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32904681/SECURITY_ANALYSIS_OF_AES_AND_ENHANCING_ITS_SECURITY_BY_MODIFYING_S_BOX_WITH_AN_ADDITIONAL_BYTE?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_32904681", "summary": "Secured and opportune transmission of data alwaysis a significant feature for any organization.

that users struggle to keep up with all their (textual) passwords is no secret. Thus, one could argue that the textual password needs to be replaced. One alternative is graphical authentication. A wide range of graphical mechanisms have been proposed in the research literature. Yet, the industry has not embraced these alternatives. We use nowadays (textual) passwords several times a day to mediate access to protected resources and to ensure that accountability is facilitated. Con- sequently, the main aspect of interest to decision-makers is the strength of an authentication mechanism to resist intrusion attempts. Yet, researchers proposing alternative mechanisms have primarily focused on the users\u2019 need for superior usability while the strength of the mechanisms often remains unknown to the decision makers. In this paper we describe a range of graphical authentication mechanisms and consider how much strength they exhibit, in comparison to the textual password. As basic criteria for this comparison, we use the standard guessability, observability and recordability metrics proposed by De Angeli et al. in 2005. The intention of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the potential for graphical mechanisms to be equal to, or superior to, the password in terms of meeting its most basic requirement namely resisting intrusion attempts.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 41009451, "asset_id": 20104134, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 19323135, "first_name": "Joseph", "last_name": "Maguire", "domain_name": "glasgow", "page_name": "JosephMaguire", "display_name": "Joseph Maguire", "profile_url": "https://glasgow.academia.edu/JosephMaguire?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/19323135/11313243/12621383/s65_joseph.maguire.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1615, "name": "Usability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Usability?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3703, "name": "Network Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Network_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33361, "name": "Authentication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Authentication?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 372842, "name": "Graphical Password Authentication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Graphical_Password_Authentication?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 12969941, "title": "Confidence Building Measures and International Cyber Security", "created_at": "2015-06-13T22:23:17.409-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12969941/Confidence_Building_Measures_and_International_Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_12969941", "summary": "This brief addresses the problem of growing mistrust between states regarding the use of cyberspace.

"summary": "In recent year the interception of signal data and meta-data has become a critical area of study in the fields of communication, techno-politics, and cyber-security. The revelation of the USUK and the infamous Five Eyes agreements to share data has produced a uniformity of understandings of the execution of global cyber-surveillance. This monolithic understanding of international cyber-surveillance has obscured both understandings of agency and surveillance these states undertake in against member states. At the same times, understanding of surveillance as data-mining, upstream and downstream data interception, and predictive analytics have produced a reading of the current techno-political moment as the coming of the technological singularity hypothesis. With these problems in mind, my work asks how conceptual uniformity of surveillance and agency as a monolithic concepts hinders deeper access to structures and politics. To this end, I draw upon Donna Haraway\u2019s trans-humanist and Judith Butler\u2019s post-structuralist readings of subjectivity and agency to sort through these conflicting projects of agency and surveillance in digital spaces. I center my concern over these conceptual ambiguities in two discussions. First, I examine what surveillance as a fragmented process means for transhumanist identities as fragmented and multiple around the five eyes. Second, around agency I take up debates around anonymity and the relics of privacy in American republicanism to examine the the collapse of agents in referent object/subject. I then use these discussions to trouble my own reading of National Security Agency systems administer Edward Snowden as a symbolic \u201csubject\u201d marooned in Moscow.

Cybersecurity is similarly a very broad concept and diverse field of practice. For computer scientists, the term 'cybersecurity' typically refers to policies, processes and practices undertaken to protect data, networks and systems from unauthorised access. Cybersecurity is used in subnational, national and transnational contexts to capture an increasingly diverse array of threats. Increasingly, cybercrimes are presented as threats to cybersecurity, which explains why national security institutions are gradually becoming involved in cybercrime control and prevention activities. This paper argues that the fields of cyber-criminology and cybersecurity, which are segregated at the moment, are in much need of greater engagement and crossfertilisation. We draw on concepts of 'high' and 'low' policing (Brodeur, 2010) to suggest it would be useful to consider 'crime' and 'security' on the same continuum. This continuum has cybercrime at one end and cybersecurity at the other, with crime being more the domain of 'low' policing while security, as conceptualised in the context of specific cybersecurity projects, falls under the responsibility of 'high' policing institutions. This unifying approach helps us to explore the fuzzy relationship between cyber-crime and cyber-security and to call for more fruitful alliances between cybercrime and cybersecurity researchers.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68329574, "asset_id": 50287755, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3977034, "first_name": "Chad", "last_name": "Whelan", "domain_name": "deakin", "page_name": "ChadWhelan", "display_name": "Chad Whelan", "profile_url": "https://deakin.academia.edu/ChadWhelan?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3977034/17752831/17782408/s65_chad.whelan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13923, "name": "Computer Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 37778, "name": "Law Enforcement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_Enforcement?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54342, "name": "Policing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Policing?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 89751, "name": "Cybercrime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybercrime?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 49966912, "title": "The three \u00abC\u00bb of the Contemporary States: Cyberspace, Cybersecurity and Counterintelligence.", "created_at": "2021-07-15T18:51:29.411-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49966912/The_three_C_of_the_Contemporary_States_Cyberspace_Cybersecurity_and_Counterintelligence?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_49966912", "summary": "There are more and more threats in cyberspace, so policies, preventive and defensive measures are not effective in mitigating and eradicating these attacks.

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), which provide distributed intelligent devices for monitoring physical or environmental conditions, are a hallmark of CPSs. CPSs often consist\nof distributed devices such as sensors and actuators to connect with and influence the physical layer system. Commonly, CPSs are monitored by Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. All the benefits gained by integrating the cyber and physical worlds assist in operating CPSs more effectively and efficiently. However, the gains obtained through deployment of CPS come with the price that CPSs are vulnerable to cyberattacks. This article starts with the definitions and introduction to fundamental concepts in CPSs. Following that, various types of cyber-attacks in a CPS are illustrated, and a detailed literature\nreview of control-oriented attack detectors is presented. Afterward,\nprominent examples of CPSs and their attack detectors are demonstrated. The article concludes with a discussion of certain future research directions in this critical and challenging area.

The methodological basis of the study includes systemic-structural, formal-logical and hermeneutical methods of scientific knowledge using special legal methods of cognition (comparative legal and historical legal). The national approaches of ASEAN member states in information security are determined by many factors, which affects the level of security in a specific state. However, state economies are interconnected and require harmonization of regulatory and institutional standards. At the regional level, initiatives so far cover the foreign policy aspect and consist of establishing sustainable relations, inter-agency cooperation and mutual assistance. The unification of standards will help achieve several goals: the sustainability of the digital economic system of the region, the growth of the qualitative and quantitative level of training, the increase in the investment attractiveness of the financial sector, and simplification of the procedures for creating FinTech companies.

The efficiency of the proposed IDS is reflected by the Accuracy and F1 metrics that reach 98% and 87%, respectively.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64526858, "asset_id": 44168119, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25896117, "first_name": "Panagiotis", "last_name": "Radoglou Grammatikis", "domain_name": "uowm", "page_name": "PanagiotisRadoglouGrammatikis", "display_name": "Panagiotis Radoglou Grammatikis", "profile_url": "https://uowm.academia.edu/PanagiotisRadoglouGrammatikis?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/25896117/13044134/18711174/s65_panagiotis.radoglou_grammatikis.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 31349, "name": "Anomaly Detection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anomaly_Detection?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1144589, "name": "Supervisor Control and Data Acqusition Systems (SCADA)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Supervisor_Control_and_Data_Acqusition_Systems_SCADA_?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1759644, "name": "IEC 60870- 5 -104", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/IEC_60870-_5_-104?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 43550042, "title": "SOLVING CYBERSECURITY CHALLENGES OF TELECOMMUTING AND VIDEO CONFERENCING APPLICATIONS IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC", "created_at": "2020-07-07T23:59:17.553-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43550042/SOLVING_CYBERSECURITY_CHALLENGES_OF_TELECOMMUTING_AND_VIDEO_CONFERENCING_APPLICATIONS_IN_THE_COVID_19_PANDEMIC?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_43550042", "summary": "In the wake of the global lockdown necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the adoption of telecommuting and remote video technologies to support real-time remote audiovisual communications has become widespread. The mass adoption of virtual office communication techniques using various work from home (WFH) implementations has become very beneficial in facilitating real-time business conversations, saving revenue and time, as well as containing the spread of COVID-19. Despite its numerous benefits as a reliable substitute for direct human-to-human close proximity communications, the technology also faces threats and vulnerabilities which malicious hackers have capitalized on to insert offensive content, obstruct conversations and intercept confidential information. The challenges have been identified alongside their impacts on privacy and security.

The goal of this research is to investigate the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the CAPTCHA generator systems; hence, developing more robust CAPTCHAs, without taking the risks of manual try and fail efforts. We develop a Convolutional Neural Network called Deep-CAPTCHA to achieve this goal. The proposed platform is able to investigate both numerical and alphanumerical CAPTCHAs. To train and develop an efficient model, we have generated a dataset of 500,000 CAPTCHAs to train our model. In this paper, we present our customised deep neural network model, we review the research gaps, the existing challenges, and the solutions to cope with the issues. Our network's cracking accuracy leads to a high rate of 98.94% and 98.31% for the numerical and the alphanumerical test datasets, respectively. That means more works is required to develop robust CAPTCHAs, to be non-crackable against automated artificial agents.

In this paper, we argue that the ways in which developing nation states adjust to and legislate the internet depends upon whether they possess a national planning strategy for international data traffic. Focusing our attention on the global trade of intangible goods in Iran, we aim to demonstrate that digital protectionism causes, to varying degrees, suppression, censorship, and the violation of freedom of speech and other civil rights on the internet. Our results show that digital protectionism generated an emergence of domestic start-ups, with companies, such as Facenema and Soroush, operating in the Iranian market in the absence of global rivals such as Facebook and WhatsApp. Yet, digital protectionism and sanction-induced barriers have triggered social problems, besides the emergence of parastatals, securing the economy to an inefficient social and economic path towards digital development.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62491547, "asset_id": 42334106, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83095550, "first_name": "Naseraddin Alizadeh", "last_name": "(\u00d6zg\u00fcr Q\u0131z\u0131lyurd)", "domain_name": "idefix", "page_name": "NaseraddinAlizadeh\u00d6zg\u00fcrK\u0131z\u0131lyurt", "display_name": "Naseraddin Alizadeh (\u00d6zg\u00fcr Q\u0131z\u0131lyurd)", "profile_url": "https://idefix.academia.edu/NaseraddinAlizadeh%C3%96zg%C3%BCrK%C4%B1z%C4%B1lyurt?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/83095550/19932857/19734277/s65_naseraddin_alizadeh._zg_r_k_z_lyurt_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 731, "name": "Evolutionary Economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Evolutionary_Economics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 750, "name": "Institutional Economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Institutional_Economics?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 802, "name": "Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Economy?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 966, "name": "Censorship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Censorship?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2015, "name": "Middle East Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_East_Studies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 3703, "name": "Network Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Network_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 5218, "name": "Iranian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iranian_Studies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 5523, "name": "Security Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_Studies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 12809, "name": "Middle Eastern Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_Eastern_Studies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 15971, "name": "Censorship (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Censorship_History_?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 18623, "name": "Middle East Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_East_Politics?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 41862, "name": "Cyberwarfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberwarfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 62706, "name": "Digital Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Economy?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 153414, "name": "Cyberwar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberwar?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 41621796, "title": "Using the CIA and AAA Models to explain Cybersecurity Activities", "created_at": "2020-01-14T02:17:07.745-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41621796/Using_the_CIA_and_AAA_Models_to_explain_Cybersecurity_Activities?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_41621796", "summary": "Cybersecurity is a broad field that is mainly concerned with protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computing devices and networks, hardware and software, and most importantly, data and information.

Every day, replication attacks attack millions of network and mobile users. Increase in amount of replication attack may be a potential danger for income of SMS or network and causes losing customers of these services provider. Humans or software can be used to encounter these replication attacks. It is obvious that lonely absolute use of each method will not result in a proper answer to encounter replication attack`s problem. Since replication attack is one of the important problems of information protection and security in organizations for computer and mobile phone users, while reviewing types of replication attacks and methods of encountering, this paper uses similarities between pathologies in body and invader factors in replication attacks, a model is provided based on biological simulation methods existing in body`s adapted immune system to encounter these threats.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53724456, "asset_id": 33729712, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 66036984, "first_name": "Amirhosein", "last_name": "Bodaghi", "domain_name": "tehran", "page_name": "AmirhoseinBodaghi", "display_name": "Amirhosein Bodaghi", "profile_url": "https://tehran.academia.edu/AmirhoseinBodaghi?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/66036984/17207663/17341648/s65_amirhosein.bodaghi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 491, "name": "Information Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Technology?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 425293, "name": "Biological Computers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biological_Computers?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 975645, "name": "Node Replication Attack", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Node_Replication_Attack?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 32921977, "title": "Telegram: the Mighty Application that ISIS Loves", "created_at": "2017-05-09T06:30:48.728-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32921977/Telegram_the_Mighty_Application_that_ISIS_Loves?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_32921977", "summary": "ISIS has been the most successful terrorist organization in history using social media and the Internet for distributing its propaganda, dissemination of its news and more importantly to communicate. There is no doubt that the frequency and quality of ISIS posts on the Internet, including their videos, memes and online journals are of a quality to make many professional editors and producers envious and they also receive much attention . \n\nTelegram has become the choice of the ISIS due to its specifications\u2014providing secure encrypted communications and allowing users to share large files and act with their accounts operating with impunity. While Telegram administrators claim, they favor speech free of interference; it is time for the owners of Telegram to thoroughly consider the existence of ISIS presence and activities on their digital platform. Telegram has become the ultimate tool for the bloodiest terrorist organization in history, carrying and spreading its terrorist ideology around the world, recruiting and even directing cadres to carry out attacks globally. Recently, the families of the San Bernardino shooting sued Facebook, Google, and Twitter, claiming that these social media companies permitted ISIS to flourish on these social media platforms . It may soon happen that Telegram will also have to deal with several legal actions as ISIS cadres continue to utilize their application for their terror operations and communications. \n\nReference

China\u2019s role in defining, developing, and promoting this concept in international politics. 3. international responses to the Chinese use of the concept of cyber sovereignty, and how this should be seen in conjunction with current trends in Chinese foreign-policy strategies. 4. the use of cyber sovereignty in diplomacy, and how China uses this concept to counter Western dominance in cyberspace. Thus, the policy brief offers a brief examination of how the Chinese idea of state sovereignty in cyberspace influences how China positions itself in international negotiations with regard to issues such as security, economy and trade, and soft power (diplomacy/governance).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52285951, "asset_id": 32020533, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 262287, "first_name": "Niels Nagelhus", "last_name": "Schia", "domain_name": "nupi", "page_name": "NielsNagelhusSchia", "display_name": "Niels Nagelhus  Schia", "profile_url": "https://nupi.academia.edu/NielsNagelhusSchia?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/262287/64566/58052514/s65_niels_nagelhus.schia.jpg"}, {"id": 62246539, "first_name": "Lars", "last_name": "Gjesvik", "domain_name": "uio", "page_name": "LarsGjesvik", "display_name": "Lars Gjesvik", "profile_url": "https://uio.academia.edu/LarsGjesvik?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/62246539/34468646/30283442/s65_lars.gjesvik.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1164, "name": "Democracy and Cyber-Democracy Theory and Practice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democracy_and_Cyber-Democracy_Theory_and_Practice?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3661, "name": "Sovereignty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sovereignty?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7822, "name": "Internet Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_Governance?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12108, "name": "China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30945, "name": "Cyberspace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberspace?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 313371, "name": "Diplomacy and international relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomacy_and_international_relations?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 31533701, "title": "ATLANTICO : \"Cyber conflits, ing\u00e9rences num\u00e9riques et Guerres Hybrides  Dans le champ Digital\"", "created_at": "2017-02-20T11:42:12.659-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31533701/ATLANTICO_Cyber_conflits_ing%C3%A9rences_num%C3%A9riques_et_Guerres_Hybrides_Dans_le_champ_Digital_?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_31533701", "summary": "Que seraient capables d'apporter nos g\u00e9ants de la technologie en cas de cyber-guerre ?

things (IoT) is still in its infancy and has attracted much interest in many industrial sectors including medical fields, logistics tracking, smart cities and automobiles. However as a paradigm, it is susceptible to a range of significant intrusion threats. This paper presents a threat analysis of the IoT and uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to combat these threats. A multi-level perceptron, a type of supervised ANN, is trained using internet packet traces, then is assessed on its ability to thwart Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS/DoS) attacks. This paper focuses on the classification of normal and threat patterns on an IoT Network. The ANN procedure is validated against a simulated IoT network. The experimental results demonstrate 99.4% accuracy and can successfully detect various DDoS/DoS attacks.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49686140, "asset_id": 27350540, "asset_type": "Work",

Preliminary results suggest that cyber competitions attract experienced individuals who will remain in the profession for the long-term, but future research is needed to understand how cyber competitions may engage women and those new to the field.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33162189, "asset_id": 6330887, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 120256, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Tobey, Ph.D.", "domain_name": "iusb", "page_name": "DavidTobeyPhD", "display_name": "David H Tobey, Ph.D.", "profile_url": "https://iusb.academia.edu/DavidTobeyPhD?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/120256/2619701/3042348/s65_david.tobey_ph.d..jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1128, "name": "Computer Science Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science_Education?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1736, "name": "Science Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_Education?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2605, "name": "Serious Games", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Serious_Games?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3668, "name": "Student Motivation And Engagement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_Motivation_And_Engagement?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10641, "name": "Game Based Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Game_Based_Learning?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 20149, "name": "Information Assurance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Assurance?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1019154, "name": "Practice Based Approaches to the Study of Knowing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Practice_Based_Approaches_to_the_Study_of_Knowing?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 4382596, "title": "Online Communities: Visualization and Formalization (slides)", "created_at": "2013-09-01T15:56:47.580-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4382596/Online_Communities_Visualization_and_Formalization_slides_?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_4382596", "summary": "Online communities have increased in size and importance dramatically over the last decade. The fact that many communities are online means that it is possible to extract information about these communities and the connections between their members much more easily using software tools, despite their potentially very large size. The links between members of the community can be presented visually and often this can make patterns in the structure of sub-communities immediately obvious. The links and structures of layered communities can also be formalized to gain a better understanding of their modelling.  This paper explores these links with some specific examples, including visualization of these relationships and a formalized model of communities using the Z notation.  It also considers the development of such communities within the Community of Practice social science framework.

Yet, while low-level micro disturbances are an everyday reality, the world has yet to see a cyber incident of systemic proportions. Establishing the likelihood of such an occurrence, however, is impossible. Systemic cyber-risks are unpredictable and incalculable due to the uncertainty surrounding them. The complexity of the socio-technical environment that they co-create makes traditional linear risk management approaches lose their meaning. This article argues that rather than trying to establish control over something that we cannot fully grasp, we need to learn how to embrace uncertainty when dealing with the digital realm. This implies a focus on dialogue and information exchange to increase situational awareness, a focus on strengthening technical and social resilience as well as sustained efforts to nurture a fault tolerant political culture that accepts the possibility of failure and lives with a certain and inevitable degree of insecurity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 5621830, "asset_id": 924319, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 350006, "first_name": "Myriam", "last_name": "Dunn Cavelty", "domain_name": "ethz", "page_name": "MyriamCavelty", "display_name": "Myriam Dunn Cavelty", "profile_url": "https://ethz.academia.edu/MyriamCavelty?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/350006/94486/302631/s65_myriam.dunn_cavelty.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12061, "name": "Risk Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Risk_Management?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16097, "name": "Decision Making Under Uncertainty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decision_Making_Under_Uncertainty?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41862, "name": "Cyberwarfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberwarfare?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 281910, "name": "Systemic Risk", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Systemic_Risk?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 81569910, "title": "Improving the Quality of \u201cThe Internet of Things\u201d Instruction in Technology Management, Cybersecurity, and Computer Science", "created_at": "2022-06-15T12:26:16.768-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/81569910/Improving_the_Quality_of_The_Internet_of_Things_Instruction_in_Technology_Management_Cybersecurity_and_Computer_Science?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_81569910", "summary": "Many universities require end of course evaluations for all courses taught as tool for academic accreditation purposes.

In this inherently complex and increasingly ambiguous environment, the concepts of hybrid threats and hybrid warfare, henceforth HT&HW, are helpful in both structuring an understanding of the nature of the threats we are facing and the strategy and modus of potential adversaries. Thus, the volume has pursued a comprehensive view of the threats as well as the existing tools and means to counter them.\n\nThis focus puts the spotlight on the nature of the threats and adversaries and the challenges they pose to Western democracies. However, it fundamentally boils down to the question of the capacity in Western-style democracies and Western security institutions to confront HT&HW, by comprehending the particular vulnerabilities in their societies and addressing them, as well as devising responses to hostile measures by external actors. The particular vulnerabilities and limitations, as well as advantages of Western democracies, call for particular approaches in this environment. Open societies built on the normative foundations of the rule of law, human rights and democracy, necessarily protective of the freedoms of speech, association and the press, need to devise solutions that not only preserve these fundamental freedoms but also draw on their particular strengths. As has been demonstrated in previous chapters, this work is well underway, in the form of numerous entities tasked with analysing and addressing the problem.\n\n264\nAgainst the backdrop of the existing overload of overlapping concepts coined or reintroduced to capture the nature of the contemporary security environment, and the controversy surrounding their use, the volume has refrained from attempts to invent new labels or engage at length with the conceptual debate. Instead, we have settled for the use of HT&HW as unifying themes for the volume in an attempt to move the discussion away from how phenomena are supposed to be termed to how they can be understood and addressed. As demonstrated by the range of contributions, there is undoubtedly much to be said on this topic. In this light, a particular contribution of the volume is the unified effort of academic scholars and practitioners, from different fields, to provide a common perspective on HT&HW, based on experiences from a wide set of empirical contexts.\n\nFor this purpose, the volume was structured into three parts, each providing a distinct perspective on HT&HW. This was intended not only to allow scholars and practitioners, as well as thematically and area-focused authors, equal chance to present their perspectives in their own right. The aim was also to create synergy effects between the different areas of expertise.\n\nThe first part gathered perspectives of key Western collective security actors represented by the two international organizations with primary responsibility for upholding the Western security community, NATO and the EU, as well as the single largest and most influential security actor, the United States. With a common point of departure in Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea, all three actors have faced a necessary reevaluation of their conceptualizations of adversaries, threats and countermeasures. Indeed, the key challenge posed by the events in 2014 was the ambiguity and obscurity of events taking place on the ground, raising serious questions regarding if, when and how to respond to similar attacks against NATO or EU members, below the threshold of actual armed attack. Both NATO and the EU have since devised a series of detection and response mechanisms focused on providing early warning and attribution of aggressive actions, as well as deterrence and retaliation. The reactions can be summarized as a common realization of previously unidentified weaknesses in Western societies and joint efforts to close these gaps.\n\nGiven the composite nature of the threats at hand, the responses need to be organized according to the same principles, integrating societal sectors as well as states. Another important takeaway from these chapters is the importance of knowing your adversary. Whereas identifying and attributing threats produces reactive responses, proactively addressing existing vulnerabilities in order to build resilience requires awareness not only of what an adversary does but also why. In this regard, it becomes pertinent to view the world through the adversary\u2019s eyes in order to identify strategic objectives and ways to achieve them as well as the adversary\u2019s vulnerabilities.\n\nThe validity of this perspective becomes particularly salient in the second part focused on the tools and means employed to conduct and counter-hybrid warfare. Indeed, the analyses of the approaches of major actors associated with HT&HW in a Western perspective, Russia and China, reveal that the conceptual overstretch accompanying these labels, considered a problem in the Western debate, instead functions as an asset in the strategic thinking of these challengers to the Western security order. In Russia, gibridnaya voina, with its inherent assumption that most of the West\u2019s international activity aims to undermine Russia one way or another, functions as a rhetorical 265device for identifying domestic or external threats and interpreting these as parts of the West\u2019s concerted offensive against Russia. In Chinese writings on the topic, the range of methods associated with HT&HW amount to a comprehensive, cross-domain spectrum denoting perceptions on threat, response and operationalization of hybrid warfare. These increasingly fluctuating borders between the different means associated with HT&HW are apparent in the analyses of information, cyber, intelligence capabilities and the military \u2013 indeed, it is questionable to what extent binary divisions into military/non-military or kinetic/non-kinetic means make sense in the current security environment. All the more so since binary thinking regarding the threat risks reproducing itself into the response, thus counteracting the proactive, comprehensive societal approaches deemed necessary to counter HT&HW.\n\nThis point is further va lidated by the contributions in the third section, presenting case studies of the United States, Taiwan, the Baltic States, Ukraine, Iran and Catalonia \u2013 demonstrating how the tools and means of HT&HW have been put to use and countered in a diverse set of empirical contexts. The problem of defending against adversaries and hostile actions that \u2013 very consciously \u2013 operate in the grey zone, below the threshold of actual war, is a recurring theme in these studies. And even if deterrent capabilities in the sense of military force may be very strong, as in the case of the United States, divided responsibilities between civilian agencies and the military, based on perhaps outdated understandings of war and peace, place limitations on the ability to respond. The contrast could not be more apparent when compared to China\u2019s policies against Taiwan, which amount to a concerted, sophisticated and strategic combination of means, which nevertheless does not (presently) include the active use of military force.\n\nThe point that strategies involving HT&HW are enacted out of a perceived necessity to challenge Western military supremacy by other means is underscored by the example of Iran, which has, due to the perceived existential threat posed by the United States, devised a strategy of guerrilla warfare, in large part performed by proxy forces and in areas outside Iran\u2019s territory. In Spain, a concerted Russian information campaign aiming to fuel and broaden national divisions over the Catalonian referendum is a clear example of how actors employing HT&HW seek out and attack vulnerabilities in target countries that are nevertheless pre-existing and do not emerge primarily as an effect of external influence or aggression.\n\nFinally, the case studies also include (at least partially) successful examples of countermeasures against hybrid warfare. In the Baltics, the relatively low level of Russian hybrid activity is attributed partially to the low priority given to the Baltic States in Russian foreign policy, but also to a largely successful deterrence strategy combining military means and broad deterrence by denial below the threshold of an armed attack. Ukraine has, in the midst of an armed but covert attack against the country, proved capable of combining a conventional military response with a sustained informational campaign that has, despite the severe losses incurred, served to expose Russia as the aggressor and consolidated domestic cohesion as well as international support for the country.\n\nThe result is a comprehensive view of what may be termed \u2018hybridity\u2019 that, rather than a static picture of actions and responses, provides a cross-sectional and cross-temporal understanding of the interaction between actors, threats, responses and results. Hybridity is a suitable label, having been used in the social sciences \u2018to 266designate processes in which discrete social practices or structures, that existed in separate ways, combine to generate new structures, objects, and practices in which the preceding elements mix\u2019.[1] Modelled below, the Hybridity Blizzard Model provides a picture of how ongoing or potential adversarial hybrid measures and responses to these dynamically impact long-term societal vulnerabilities and resilience.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66678296, "asset_id": 47732490, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 149406, "first_name": "Mikael", "last_name": "Weissmann", "domain_name": "fhs", "page_name": "MikaelWeissmann", "display_name": "Mikael Weissmann", "profile_url": "https://fhs.academia.edu/MikaelWeissmann?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/149406/775099/59747628/s65_mikael.weissmann.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2674, "name": "Intelligence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intelligence?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3872, "name": "War Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/War_Studies?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9218, "name": "Strategic Communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Strategic_Communication?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11337, "name": "Cyber Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Warfare?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 13546, "name": "Resilience (Sustainability)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Resilience_Sustainability_?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 18085, "name": "Psychological operations (PSYOP)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychological_operations_PSYOP_?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 18086, "name": "Information operations (IO)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_operations_IO_?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46989, "name": "Ukraine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ukraine?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 61620, "name": "National Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 105456, "name": "Intelligence Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intelligence_Analysis?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 174704, "name": "Defence and Strategic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Defence_and_Strategic_Studies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 215782, "name": "Security and Defence Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_and_Defence_Studies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 294517, "name": "Defense and Strategic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Defense_and_Strategic_Studies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 346639, "name": "Intelligence and security studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intelligence_and_security_studies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 378350, "name": "Hybrid Threats", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybrid_Threats?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1038695, "name": "Grey Zone", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Grey_Zone?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 45091027, "title": "The Politics of Security and Technology in Switzerland (Swiss Political Science Review)", "created_at": "2021-02-10T01:31:17.518-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45091027/The_Politics_of_Security_and_Technology_in_Switzerland_Swiss_Political_Science_Review_?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_45091027", "summary": "Technologies play crucial roles in security politics. In a recent push to understand the dynamic interplay between technologies and politics, IR scholars increasingly draw on reflexive research traditions. The aim is to understand the social and political practices that influence the shape, design and use of security technologies instead of assuming that technologies have linear, independent effects on politics. This SPSR debate draws on this new perspective and applies it to topics salient in Swiss public debate. Its contributions analyze how cybersecurity, predictive policing, drones, artificial intelligence, targeted sanctions, urban design and spyware are deliberated, negotiated, programmed and critiqued in Switzerland. They chart different analytical avenues with which to address the recursive and non-linear relationship between security politics and technologies, and, by familiarizing readers with the tenets and diversity of reflexive political science research, seek to give that longstanding scholarly research tradition better visibility in the Swiss political science community.\n\nTechnologien spielen in der Sicherheitspolitik eine entscheidende Rolle. Um das Zusammenspiel von Technologie und Politik besser zu verstehen, greift die IB-Forschung zunehmend auf reflexive Forschungsans\u00e4tze zur\u00fcck. Ziel ist es dabei, die sozialen und politischen Faktoren und Praktiken zu verstehen, die Einfluss auf die Form, das Design und den Einsatz von Sicherheitstechnologien haben, anstatt davon auszugehen, dass Technologien lineare, unabh\u00e4ngige Auswirkungen auf die Politik haben. Diese SPSR-Debatte wendet diese neue Perspektive auf Themen an, die heute im \u00f6ffentlichen Diskurs der Schweiz eine wichtige Rolle spielen. Ihre sieben Beitr\u00e4ge analysieren, wie Cybersicherheit, Predictive Policing, Drohnen, k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz, Sanktionen, St\u00e4dtebau und Spyware in der Schweiz diskutiert, verhandelt, programmiert und kritisiert werden. Sie zeigen verschiedene analytische Wege auf, um die rekursive und nichtlineare Beziehung zwischen Sicherheitspolitik und -technologien greifbar zu machen, und macht der Schweizer Politikwissenschaft die Grunds\u00e4tze und die Vielfalt der reflexiven politikwissenschaftlichen Forschung besser vertraut. \n\nLes technologies jouent un r\u00f4le primordial dans la politique de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.

The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a vital role in detecting anomalies and attacks in the network. In this work, data mining concept is integrated with an IDS to identify the relevant, hidden data of interest for the user effectively and with less execution time. Four issues such as Classification of Data, High Level of Human Interaction, Lack of Labeled Data, and Effectiveness of Distributed Denial of Service Attack are being solved using the proposed algorithms like EDADT algorithm, Hybrid IDS model, Semi Supervised Approach and Varying HOPERAA Algorithm respectively.

Information security began with computer security, during World War II (WW2).

Attackers became more adept at breaking through systems, accessing and retrieving information that was otherwise, secure and meant to be confidential. Computer technology made it possible for communication channels to improve their connections, and for the speed of information, to progressively develop. Accessibility also increased the need to historically develop information security plans and policies that would address potential cyberattacks and threats to information privacy. In Academic Libraries, librarians could work with Information Technology (IT) professionals to develop an effective Information Security Policy, in order to prepare for and prevent potential attacks. The history of information security policies in Academic Libraries has developed, alongside the computer technology generation; libraries have adapted and developed over the years, as a result of the various technological changes influencing their learning environments. \n\t\nThis paper will review the historical developments and changes that have occurred in the information technology field, while connecting these advancements to Academic Libraries, and reviewing how the changes have transformed these learning centers, into next generation libraries, challenged by the ongoing threats of cyberattacks.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58597087, "asset_id": 38527749, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9558100, "first_name": "Karine", "last_name": "Parry", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "KarineParry", "display_name": "Karine Parry", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/KarineParry?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9558100/5731130/6516753/s65_karine.parry.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4709, "name": "Academic Libraries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Academic_Libraries?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23506, "name": "Information Security and Privacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security_and_Privacy?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 418608, "name": "Academic Library Services", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Academic_Library_Services?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37138243, "title": "Information Space An Emerging India Russia Strategic Partnership", "created_at": "2018-07-28T01:12:56.808-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37138243/Information_Space_An_Emerging_India_Russia_Strategic_Partnership?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_37138243", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57088005, "asset_id": 37138243, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11711173, "first_name": "Scholar", "last_name": "Pakistan", "domain_name": "pu-pk1", "page_name": "ScholarPakistan", "display_name": "Scholar Pakistan", "profile_url": "https://pu-pk1.academia.edu/ScholarPakistan?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11711173/3376827/3973542/s65_scholar.pakistan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 37, "name": "Information Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Systems?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 459, "name": "Information Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Science?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 491, "name": "Information Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Technology?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7361, "name": "Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 7454, "name": "Information Communication Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Communication_Technology?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 41863, "name": "Russia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russia?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 48150, "name": "Pakistan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan_Studies?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 511848, "name": "Cyber Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Space?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 1146932, "name": "India and Russia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India_and_Russia?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 37125624, "title": "5 Hallmarks of an Effective CyberSecurity Program", "created_at": "2018-07-26T06:03:26.931-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37125624/5_Hallmarks_of_an_Effective_CyberSecurity_Program?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_37125624", "summary": "The challenge for any effective Cybersecurity Program is to implement a comprehensive program which incorporates the control elements below; the controls highlighted in bold are the must haves for the basic level of protection.

As evidence of this fact, one may refer to some recent reports and the European Parliament\u2019s resolution on civil law rules on robotics.The latter will be the primary focus of this analysis since the EU Parliament is the first legal institution in the world to have initiated work of a law on robots and artificial intelligence. The European strategy on robotics seems affected by two main problems: an excessive emphasis on ethics at the expense of security, and more gen-erally, a lack of awareness of the critical role played by the operation of striking a balance between competing interests. Balancing is pivotal to the interpretation and application of the law. And the current development of AI technologies does not enable the delegation of the operation to robots. Certainly, the most controversial point regards the status of robots as electronic persons. Even though the suggestion may seem extreme, it may prove to be successful, for at least three reasons. First, robots are becoming more and more similar to humans (anthropomorfisation and AI). Second, humans are becoming increasingly akin to robots (artificial enhancement). Third, the robot\u2019s legal personality would be profitable for the robotic industry.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55346968, "asset_id": 35484259, "asset_type": "Work",

At the end of the study useful suggestions for Transmission System Operators and Generation Operators are offered, besides a reasoned set of figures assessing the costs on the implementation of security systems.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53404744, "asset_id": 33345465, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 38687678, "first_name": "Elena", "last_name": "Ragazzi", "domain_name": "cnr-it", "page_name": "ElenaRagazzi", "display_name": "Elena  Ragazzi", "profile_url": "https://cnr-it.academia.edu/ElenaRagazzi?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/38687678/10811517/12066930/s65_elena.ragazzi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3703, "name": "Network Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Network_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7639, "name": "Standards", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Standards?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42343, "name": "Electricity Market", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Electricity_Market?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43986, "name": "Electricity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Electricity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 115676, "name": "Cyber Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Security?f_ri=46738"}, {"id": 128408, "name": "COST ESTIMATION IN PROJECT MANAGEMENT", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/COST_ESTIMATION_IN_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT?f_ri=46738"}]}, {"id": 30618874, "title": "EXPLORING CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS FOR CYBERSECURITY IN BHUTAN'S GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS", "created_at": "2016-12-26T21:12:27.691-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30618874/EXPLORING_CRITICAL_SUCCESS_FACTORS_FOR_CYBERSECURITY_IN_BHUTANS_GOVERNMENT_ORGANIZATIONS?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_30618874", "summary": "This paper presents the results of open-ended survey exploring the critical success factors for cybersecurity implementation in government organisations in Bhutan. Successful implementation of cybersecurity depends on a thorough understanding of cyber threats and challenges to the organisational information assets. It also depends on identification of a responsible, dedicated personnel to lead and direct cybersecurity initiatives. Furthermore, it is important to know the critical areas of cybersecurity activities for management to target, prioritise and execute. Understanding of what key things need to be done right by the responsible agency and its leader, at a particular time and in particular context, can lead to better decision making and resource optimisation including skills and knowledge. The survey findings indicate that, among other factors, awareness and training, policy and standards, and adequate financing and budgetary commitment to cybersecurity projects are three most important success factors. Channelling an organisation's limited resources to these few factors is expected to enhance cybersecurity posture and its management. The research outcome has implications to both government and private organizations in Bhutan.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51068036, "asset_id": 30618874, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 15689241, "first_name": "Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)", "last_name": "Computer Science Conference Proceedings (CSCP)", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ComputerScienceInformationTechnologyCSIT", "display_name": "Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT) Computer Science Conference Proceedings (CSCP)", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ComputerScienceInformationTechnologyCSIT?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/15689241/4239141/4932687/s65_computer_science_information_technology_cs_it_.computer_science_conference_proceedings_cscp_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 236344, "name": "Top Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Top_Management?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367417, "name": "Critical Success Factors", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Success_Factors?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2599067, "name": "Awareness and Training", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Awareness_and_Training?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 29957250, "title": "Der 7.

Whether conflict between nations, civil wars, or some combination of both, the twenty-first century has seen no decrease in war, terrorism, and bloodshed. Why is this? Has not our inter-connected and globalized world learned yet to live peacefully? While some philosophers and academics have proclaimed that today\u2019s world is actually more peaceful and less violent than in ages past, it would be difficult to argue that acts of sensational and purposeful violence have not captivated us over the last few decades. There is, however, one voice among many that has given us plenty to think about regarding some of the pitfalls that our increasingly technological world may continue to face. Jacques Ellul is that voice. This book brings together a number of perspectives on Ellul\u2019s thinking about violence and war. Collected from conference presentations, previous editions of the Ellul Forum, or just plain new thinking, these articles give the reader an overview of Ellul\u2019s writing on violence, resistance, and war. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45098977, "asset_id": 24770693, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4962606, "first_name": "Jeffrey", "last_name": "Shaw", "domain_name": "usnwc", "page_name": "JeffreyShaw", "display_name": "Jeffrey M .

For this reason, an executive summary was provided to campus leadership to present essentials of the event, challenges, and initial recommendations. It is understandable the scope of review will differ for sessions held with campus administration, the technology staff, and users. However, coordinated and effective remedies will depend critically upon consistent, congruent references, concepts, and perceptions.

To do so we first define cybersecurity by situating it within the broader framework of the changing concept of security. To this end we look at the evolution of the security concept, mainly since the end of the Cold War, and its relationship to cybersecurity in today\u2019s global affairs. Then we identify the referent object of security, the importance of cyberthreats, and the need for a multileveled management of cybersecurity and cyberthreats. For such a management to be possible and effective, this paper argues that the development of a security culture of multileveled cybersecurity is necessary. To demonstrate how that could happen policy-wise, we briefly look at the current state of international cooperation on cybersecurity and put forward the idea of a framework of multileveled and global cooperation based on a strategy aiming at developing a global security culture of cybersecurity. Moreover, it is suggested that the development of this security culture should be gradual, based on horizontal and vertical multileveled cooperation, by starting with \u201clow-politics\u201d or non-politically sensitive cybersecurity matters. Such a multileveled framework of cybersecurity, with successful communication lines on and between all levels, may even provide a good platform for cooperation in other domains as well.",

"summary": "As the use of web and mobile applications is becoming pervasive for service delivery and user mobility support, enterprises are now increasingly fighting against a huge number of emerging security threats which interfere with the process of service delivery. As an attempt to help the enterprises in dealing with the emerging security threats in the converged service delivery architecture, this paper presents a methodology for security threat analysis and security requirements specification in web/mobile applications development. The presented methodology is based on a case study Livestock Data Center (LDC) system, which is being developed and it allows both web and mobile interfaces as service delivery channels. Hence the system serves as a representative of other similar setups of service delivery.\nIn addition to the processes of analysis and security specification, the methodology involves threat modeling as well. There are several threat models in the literature. The STRIDE threats model is one among the existing threats models that is used to identify security threats that needs to be addressed in systems such as the LDC system. The STRIDE threats model has been used to identify the likely security threats to our case study. On applying the STRIDE threats model the following threats were identified as prominent: sensitive data exposure, weak server side controls, client side injection, and weak authentication and authorization.\nThe identified security threats were compared to existing threats in traditional web and mobile applications separately in order to figure out the changes when the two computing platforms come together. The findings from our case study have shown that the proposed methodology for security threat analysis and security design can be useful in security requirements specifications in the converged web-mobile applications during development, and can be generally used to assist developers of other similar systems.\nKeywords: web and mobile applications security, STRIDE, Livestock Data Center, security requirements.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34628066, "asset_id": 8197848, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6414964, "first_name": "Zaipuna", "last_name": "Yonah", "domain_name": "nm-aist", "page_name": "ZaipunaYonah", "display_name": "Zaipuna Yonah", "profile_url": "https://nm-aist.academia.edu/ZaipunaYonah?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6414964/2680776/12269523/s65_zaipuna.yonah.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 40744, "name": "ICT4DEV", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ICT4DEV?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 78636, "name": "Mobile Applications and Web Applications development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobile_Applications_and_Web_Applications_development?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 7177286, "title": "Reliability and Performance of Intensity Analytics\u2019 TickStream.KeyID User Authentication Software Engine", "created_at": "2014-05-27T13:57:35.030-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7177286/Reliability_and_Performance_of_Intensity_Analytics_TickStream_KeyID_User_Authentication_Software_Engine?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_7177286", "summary": "Intensity Analytics has developed an authentication system for computer users based on the natural consistency of typing.

It attributes the poor state of U.S. cyber policy to the \"bewildering array of overlapping responsibilities\" scattered among government offices and departments; the difficult imperative of sharing responsibility among military and civilian authorities; the fact that most of the networks (and the dependent critical infrastructures) that need protecting are in private hands; and the lack of public understanding of the kinds of regulation that are necessary or appropriate. The essay argues that meaningful progress towards an adequate legal framework depends on a broad national debate aimed at defining the public good with regard to cybersecurity, and the inevitable trade-offs among security, privacy, productivity, economic growth, organizational flexibility, military effectiveness, government transparency, and accountability that must be confronted in making sensible cybersecurity policy.\r\n\r\nKeywords: cybersecurity, national security\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53999167, "asset_id": 3623387, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33534, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Shane", "domain_name": "osu", "page_name": "PeterShane", "display_name": "Peter M Shane", "profile_url": "https://osu.academia.edu/PeterShane?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33534/10932/54164/s65_peter.shane.33534"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 799, "name": "Public Administration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Administration?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 61620, "name": "National Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Security?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 3498080, "title": "Extending Cybersecurity, Securing Private Internet Infrastructure:  The U.S. Einstein Program and its Implications for Internet Governance  (2013)", "created_at": "2013-05-09T00:51:37.191-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3498080/Extending_Cybersecurity_Securing_Private_Internet_Infrastructure_The_U_S_Einstein_Program_and_its_Implications_for_Internet_Governance_2013_?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_3498080", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31237937, "asset_id": 3498080, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 653060, "first_name": "Andreas", "last_name": "Kuehn", "domain_name": "syr", "page_name": "AndreasKuehn", "display_name": "Andreas Kuehn", "profile_url": "https://syr.academia.edu/AndreasKuehn?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2783, "name": "Privacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Privacy?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7822, "name": "Internet Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_Governance?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 80192, "name": "Deep Packet Inspection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deep_Packet_Inspection?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 80328656, "title": "E-Learning Application for Prevention, Detection and Therapy of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder", "created_at": "2022-05-30T21:40:46.576-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/80328656/E_Learning_Application_for_Prevention_Detection_and_Therapy_of_Posttraumatic_Stress_Disorder?f_ri=46738", "dom_id": "work_80328656", "summary": "In 2014 the amount of people suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder in Ukraine significantly increased due to Antiterrorist Operation in Ukraine.

Literature review showed that in Zimbabwe, no research had attempted to come up with a cybersecurity culture framework for grassroot users of cyberspace. The research was guided by the interpretivist paradigm and employed a qualitative methodology. A descriptive research design was used to answer the research questions and unstructured interviews were done to ascertain the cybersecurity needs and challenges of grassroot users of cyberspace. A cybersecurity culture framework was then crafted based on the research findings. The researchers recommended that Zimbabwe should have a cybersecurity vision and strategy that cascades to the grassroot users of cyberspace. Furthermore, the education curricula should be revised so that it incorporates cybersecurity courses at primary and secondary school level. This will then ensure that ICT adoption is matched with cyber hygiene and responsible use of cyberspace.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 85160267, "asset_id": 77940446, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4091897, "first_name": "Professor Gabriel", "last_name": "Kabanda", "domain_name": "uz-ac", "page_name": "ProfessorGabrielKabanda", "display_name": "Professor Gabriel Kabanda", "profile_url": "https://uz-ac.academia.edu/ProfessorGabrielKabanda?f_ri=46738", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4091897/1576430/42370481/s65_professor_gabriel.kabanda.jpg"}, {"id": 19667811, "first_name": "Tinashe", "last_name": "Chingoriwo", "domain_name": "uz-ac", "page_name": "TinasheChingoriwo", "display_name": "Tinashe Chingoriwo", "profile_url": "https://uz-ac.academia.edu/TinasheChingoriwo?f_ri=46738", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 465, "name": "Artificial Intelligence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Artificial_Intelligence?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2008, "name": "Machine Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Machine_Learning?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46738, "name": "Cybersecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cybersecurity?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 413148, "name": "Big Data / Analytics / Data Mining", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Big_Data_Analytics_Data_Mining?f_ri=46738", "nofollow": false}]}]
