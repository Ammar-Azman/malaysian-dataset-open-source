Most importantly, 2020 saw the lengthiest cessation of hostilities that has taken place between the two sides since 2004: the covid19 ceasefire. This article assesses the importance of these developments and puts forward the argument that 2020 has been the most significant year for conflict resolution efforts in the south since the conflict began in 2004; although there are many factors in place that may obstruct efforts at securing a lasting resolution to this conflict in the near future. Additionally, this essay provides background to the arguments put forward by examining processes and events since 2014 that have paved the way for the aforementioned developments of 2020.",

This research was a kind of qualitative study. The data were collected by using observation and interview techniques. To find out the forms of communication accommodation performed by Pattani students, the researchers adopted communication accommodation theory by Giles. The results of this research revealed that there were two forms of communication accommodation performed by Pattani student. Firstly, convergence, was performed when Pattani students tried to level communication behavior with their speech partners. Convergence done by Pattani students can be classified into pre-convergence, convergence process, and post convergence. Secondly, divergence is defending Pattani identity when communicating with Javanese students.

This study is a preliminary look at how negative race and ethnic relations between ASEAN nationals have not abated, coloring their view of regional integration. It looks at how race relations between ASEAN member countries have developed alongside the creation of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint in 2007 up to the present. Based on a review of the structure of the ASEAN and a tally of racial conflicts within five Southeast Asian countries, we offer two observations. First, the situation in Southeast Asia parallels the growth of an anti-regionalist sentiment in Europe due to supposed violations of national sovereignty.
